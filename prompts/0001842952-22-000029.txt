Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of women living with cancer. 
Profound advancements in oncology drug development have expanded the treatment options available to women with cancer, yet therapeutic resistance and relapse continue to limit the efficacy and duration of such treatments. Collectively, our founders and management team have decades of experience identifying and characterizing the mechanisms that drive cancer initiation and subsequent relapse in women with cancer and who have been associated with the development of products such as Kisqali (ribociclib), Arimidex (anastrozole), and Afinitor (everolimus) to treat such cancers. 
Our development team is advancing a pipeline of innovative therapies with a primary focus on treating female cancers. Our first program and lead product candidate, onapristone extended release (“ONA-XR”), builds upon a foundation of successful drug development by our management team and advisors in the field of female hormone-dependent cancers. ONA-XR is a selective and potentially potent antagonist of the progesterone receptor (PR), a receptor that is activated by the hormone progesterone and that has been linked to resistance to multiple classes of cancer therapeutics, including anti-estrogen therapies, that are prescribed to treat female hormone-dependent cancers. In 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial in collaboration with Jefferson Health to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Arimidex (anastrozole) in PR+ endometrial cancer and preliminary data is expected in mid-2022. Also, in 2020 we initiated a Phase 0 trial of ONA-XR in a window of opportunity study in primary breast cancer, and we reported preliminary data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2021. In 2021, a Phase 1b/2 investigator-sponsored trial was initiated in collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Ibrance (palbociclib) and Femara (leterozole) in first line (1L) metastatic breast cancer patients with biochemically recurrent disease, defined as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) positive. This is potentially a new clinical opportunity for the estimated 20% of 1L patients who are at high risk of early disease progression on Ibrance plus Femara combination therapy and Phase 1b data is expected in mid-2022. In 2021, the first stage of a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial initiated by MSK to evaluate ONA-XR in recurrent granulosa cell tumors (GCT) of the ovary was completed. In July 2021, MSK initiated the second stage of this trial evaluating ONA-XR in combination with Arimidex, and preliminary data is expected in the second half of 2022. Also in 2021, a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial was initiated in collaboration with Wisconsin Oncology Network (WON) to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Faslodex (fulvestrant) in second line (2L) or third line (3L) metastatic breast cancer. This trial is intended to evaluate potential ONA-XR plus Faslodex drug synergy after treatment failure of CDK4/6 and/or PIK3α inhibitors, and preliminary data is expected in the second half of 2022. In 2022, WON intends to initiate a sub-study of its Phase 2 trial in 2L/3L metastatic breast cancer that will evaluate the uptake of radiolabeled progesterone (F-FFNP) via PET imaging in breast tumors. Our second program, CLDN6xCD3 bsAb, is an anti-CD3 x anti-Claudin 6 (CLDN6) antigen bispecific monoclonal antibody (bsAbs) that is intended to redirect T-cell-mediated lysis toward malignant cells expressing CLDN6. CLDN6 is a tight junction membrane protein target expressed in multiple cancers, including ovarian and endometrial tumors, and absent from healthy adult tissues. We expect to select a candidate to support IND-enabling studies for CLDN6xCD3 bsAb in the second half of 2022. Beyond these two product candidates, we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our pipeline. We believe our team and capabilities uniquely position us to be a leader in developing novel therapies to address female cancers. 
Context retains worldwide development and commercialization rights for ONA-XR outside of Greater China and retains full worldwide development and commercialization rights to certain CLDN6 antibody patents in the field of bispecific antibodies. Our product candidates are shown in the table below:
Our Product Pipeline and Development 
PR antagonist program: ONA-XR 
Currently, there are no approved therapies that selectively target progesterone receptor positive (PR+) cancers. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that onapristone extended release (ONA-XR) has anticancer activity by inhibiting PR binding to chromatin, downregulating cancer stem cell mobilization and blocking immune evasion. ONA-XR is currently being evaluated in three Phase 2 trials, and one Phase 1b/2 trial in women with primary or metastatic breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers. These trials are intended to establish safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity at the recommended Phase 2 dose of ONA-XR to guide potential advancement in Phase 3 development in 2023. 
To help inform which patients may be most suitable for treatment with ONA-XR, we are evaluating multiple biomarker assays, including tools to monitor activated progesterone receptor as well as a PR gene activation signature that measures PR signaling activity, both of which are being utilized in our ongoing clinical trials and may be used for patient selection in future clinical trials. We expect to report preliminary data from two of our ongoing trials in mid-2022 and from the other two trials in the second half of 2022. 
CLDN6xCD3 bispecific antibody program 
Our second program, CLDN6xCD3 bsAb, is an anti-CD3 x anti-Claudin 6 (CLDN6xCD3) antigen bispecific monoclonal antibody (bsAbs) that is intended to redirect T-cell-mediated lysis toward malignant cells expressing CLDN6. CLDN6 is a tight junction membrane protein target expressed in ovarian and endometrial tumors and absent from healthy adult tissues. The structural complexity of CLDN6 and its similarity to proteins expressed on healthy tissue, particularly Claudin 9 (CLDN9), have limited its exploitation for targeted oncology therapies. Several pharmaceutical companies are developing anti-CLDN6 antibodies and/or bispecific antibodies. We expect to select a candidate to support IND-enabling studies for CLDN6xCD3 bsAb in the second half of 2022. 
Other preclinical programs 
In addition to our product candidates, we are leveraging our knowledge in female cancers to pursue discovery stage research programs. We continue to evaluate new opportunities to expand our pipeline in female cancers.
Our Management Team 
We have assembled a management team to develop novel products to treat female cancers. Members of our management team have experience leading organizations that have advanced multiple oncology therapeutics from early-stage research to clinical trials, and ultimately to regulatory approval and commercialization. Our team’s select accomplishments include: 
•Our Chief Executive Officer co-founded Context in 2015 and was previously a venture capitalist at Osage University Partners, where he led multiple oncology investments for the firm that resulted in successful public offerings or acquisitions. 
•Our Chief Financial Officer previously served as Chief Financial Officer of Millendo Therapeutics, a publicly-traded biopharmaceutical company. Prior to Millendo, our CFO served as Director of Technical Accounting at PAREXEL International and began her career as an auditor at Ernst & Young.
•Our Chief Legal Officer previously severed as Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Assistant Corporate Secretary of OptiNose, a publicly-traded specialty pharmaceutical company. Prior to OptiNose, he served as Associate General Counsel of Teva Pharmaceuticals, a global pharmaceuticals company. 
•Our Chief Medical Officer previously held the same position at H3 Biomedicine, where he led the early phase development for an oral selective estrogen receptor covalent antagonist (SERCA). During his career, he has either led or supported global drug development programs for several novel oncology drugs, including Kisqali (ribociclib), Arimidex (anastrozole), and Afinitor (everolimus), resulting in successful global registrations. 
•Our management team has been involved in several multimillion-dollar strategic transactions, including as part of the leadership teams at Celgene, and Novartis. 
We are supported by our advisors who are leading experts in female cancers. Our arrangements with these individuals do not entitle us to any of their existing or future intellectual property derived from their independent research or research with other third parties beyond what has previously been licensed to us. 
Strategy 
Our goal is to develop and commercialize innovative and differentiated oncology products that address significant unmet medical needs in the field of female cancer, with a primary focus on the hormone-dependent subcategory. The key components of our strategy to achieve this goal include: 
•Leveraging the insights, experience, and networks of our management team and advisors. Our management team and advisors have extensive experience identifying, developing, and commercializing innovative cancer therapeutics aimed at novel targets, including Kisqali, Arimidex, and Afinitor. We are using this broad oncology experience together with our internal search and development capabilities to build a diverse pipeline of therapies targeting multiple cancer resistance mechanisms. For example, our first program and lead product candidate, ONA-XR, while acquired from Arno Therapeutics, builds on academic work originally conducted by the laboratory of our scientific advisor, Dr. Carol Lange. 
•Focusing on product candidates that can be first or second in market based on current competition. We believe that being first or second in market provides a unique advantage that later competitors may not be able to overcome. Based on the current competitors that are developing similar product candidates, we believe that we have the opportunity to be the first anti-progestin approved for PR+ cancer and one of the early market participants with our CLDN6xCD3 bsAb. 
•Completing clinical development and obtaining regulatory approval for ONA-XR for the treatment of breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. The PR signaling pathway has been implicated in resistance to anti-estrogen therapies in female hormone-dependent cancers, including breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. Our clinical development effort for ONA-XR, a selective and potentially potent small molecule antagonist of PR, will initially focus on indications where there is evidence suggesting PR-mediated signaling contributes to resistance and disease progression. In 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial in collaboration with Jefferson Health to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Arimidex (anastrozole) in PR+ endometrial cancer and preliminary data is expected in mid-2022. Also, in 2020 we initiated a Phase 0 trial of ONA-XR in a window of opportunity study in primary breast cancer, and we reported preliminary data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2021. In 2021, a Phase 1b/2 investigator-sponsored trial was initiated in collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Ibrance (palbociclib) and Femara (leterozole) in first line (1L) metastatic breast cancer patients with biochemically recurrent disease, defined as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) positive. This is potentially a new clinical opportunity for the estimated 20% of 1L patients who are at high risk of early disease progression on Ibrance plus Femara combination therapy and Phase 1b data is expected in mid-2022. In 2021, the first stage of a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial initiated by MSK to evaluate ONA-XR in recurrent granulosa cell tumors (GCT) of the ovary was completed. In July 2021, MSK initiated the second stage of this trial evaluating ONA-XR in combination with Arimidex, and preliminary data is expected in the second half of 2022. Also in 2021, a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial was initiated in collaboration with Wisconsin Oncology Network (WON) to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Faslodex (fulvestrant) in second line (2L) or third line (3L) metastatic breast cancer. This trial is intended to evaluate potential ONA-XR plus Faslodex drug synergy after treatment failure of CDK4/6 and/or PIK3α inhibitors, and preliminary data is expected in the second half of 2022. In 2022, WON intends to initiate a sub-study of its Phase 2 trial in 2L/3L metastatic breast cancer that will evaluate the uptake of radiolabeled progesterone (F-FFNP) via PET imaging in breast tumors.
•Advancing our second program, CLDN6xCD3 bsAb, as rapidly as reasonably possible through preclinical and clinical development. Our second program, CLDN6xCD3 bsAb, is an anti-CD3 x anti-Claudin 6 (CLDN6xCD3) antigen bispecific monoclonal antibody (bsAbs) that is intended to redirect T-cell-mediated lysis toward malignant cells expressing CLDN6. CLDN6 is a membrane protein target expressed in multiple female cancers, including ovarian and endometrial, and absent from healthy adult tissues. We expect to select a candidate to support IND-enabling studies for CLDN6xCD3 bsAb in the second half of 2022.
•Evaluating opportunities to accelerate development timelines and enhance the commercial potential of our programs in collaboration with third parties, including through the potential out-licensing of our product candidates. We have established collaborations and intend to continue evaluating opportunities to work with partners that meaningfully enhance our capabilities with respect to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, which may entail the potential out-licensing of the development and commercialization of our product candidates to larger pharmaceutical organizations, including our lead product candidate ONA-XR. For example, we entered into a manufacturing and development agreement with Tyligand Bioscience (Shanghai) Limited for ONA-XR that is intended to enhance our ability to meet drug manufacturing demands and expand our clinical trial footprint into Greater China. It is also possible that similar arrangements for ONA-XR could be sought for other geographic footprints. In addition, we intend to commercialize our product candidates in key markets either alone or with partners in order to maximize the worldwide commercial potential of our programs. 
•In-licensing or acquiring additional drug candidates to build a fully integrated company focused on female cancers. We believe that accessing external innovation and expertise is important to our success and plan to leverage our leadership team’s prior business development experience as we evaluate potential in-licensing and acquisition opportunities to further expand our portfolio. For example, CLDN6xCD3 bsAb was licensed from Integral Molecular, Inc. (“Integral”), a company where our management and advisors 
have long-standing relationships. We aim to be the partner of choice for academic groups and companies in the field of female cancers. 
Our focus on female hormone-dependent cancer 
Up to 70% of women with breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer have hormone-dependent cancer. The hormones estrogen and progesterone drive cancer progression in those patients, but anti-estrogens are the only antihormonal therapy that is FDA approved and available to clinicians. Therefore, treatment of those patients to date has consisted of anti-estrogens alone or in combination with drugs that enhance the antitumor activity of anti-estrogens, including inhibitors of CDK4/6 or PI3Kα. Given the broad use of anti-estrogens, anti-estrogen resistance is now a major clinical challenge. Treatment options for anti-estrogen resistance are limited, provide modest therapeutic benefit, and are associated with side effects. 
Estrogen and progesterone are master regulators of normal female sex organ development and function, acting via estrogen receptors (“ER”) and progesterone receptors (“PR”). Mechanistically, published data suggest that in hormone-dependent cancers, ER and PR are often hyperactive, constantly pushing breast, ovary, and endometrial tissues to grow, divide, and metastasize. One such strategy to block this hormone-mediated growth is to administer anti-estrogen therapy (fulvestrant, letrozole, anastrozole, or tamoxifen), which may be used in combination with inhibitors of CDK4/6 or PI3Kα to enhance anti-estrogen mediated effects. However, the cancer cells respond to this selective pressure of ER inhibition by further activating progesterone signaling as a compensatory mechanism, along with other resistance mechanisms that can further activate PR, including ER ligand binding mutations (ESR1), growth factor signaling, and enrichment of cancer stem cells. Over time, it is believed that all patients become resistant to anti-estrogens due to direct or indirect compensatory signaling mediated by the PR and other factors. These findings suggest that progesterone receptor and proteins that regulate PR could represent promising drug targets to address anti-estrogen resistance. 
Overview of antiestrogen resistance mechanisms 
We are building a portfolio of novel agents targeting multiple anti-estrogen resistance mechanisms by leveraging our specialized expertise in hormone-dependent cancers. 
PR antagonist program: ONA-XR 
Published data suggest that the PR signaling pathway is implicated in resistance to anti-estrogen therapies in female hormone-dependent cancer, including breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. Our clinical development effort for ONA-XR, a selective and potentially potent small molecule antagonist of PR, will initially focus on indications where there is evidence suggesting PR-mediated signaling contributes to resistance and disease progression. In 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial in collaboration with Jefferson Health to 
evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Arimidex (anastrozole) in PR+ endometrial cancer and preliminary data is expected in mid-2022. Also, in 2020 we initiated a Phase 0 trial of ONA-XR in a window of opportunity study in primary breast cancer, and we reported preliminary data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2021. In 2021, a Phase 1b/2 investigator-sponsored trial was initiated in collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Ibrance (palbociclib) and Femara (leterozole) in first line (1L) metastatic breast cancer patients with biochemically recurrent disease, defined as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) positive. This is potentially a new clinical opportunity for the estimated 20% of 1L patients who are at high risk of early disease progression on Ibrance plus Femara combination therapy and Phase 1b data is expected in mid-2022. In 2021, the first stage of a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial initiated by MSK to evaluate ONA-XR in recurrent granulosa cell tumors (GCT) of the ovary was completed. In July 2021, MSK initiated the second stage of this trial evaluating ONA-XR in combination with Arimidex, and preliminary data is expected in the second half of 2022. Also in 2021, a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial was initiated in collaboration with Wisconsin Oncology Network (WON) to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Faslodex (fulvestrant) in second line (2L) or third line (3L) metastatic breast cancer. This trial is intended to evaluate potential ONA-XR plus Faslodex drug synergy after treatment failure of CDK4/6 and/or PIK3α inhibitors, and preliminary data is expected in the second half of 2022. In 2022, WON intends to initiate a sub-study of its Phase 2 trial in 2L/3L metastatic breast cancer that will evaluate the uptake of radiolabeled progesterone (F-FFNP) via PET imaging in breast tumors.
Progesterone receptor background 
Progesterone receptor (PR) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that is expressed primarily in female reproductive tissues. In response to the endogenous steroid hormone, progesterone, PR regulates the expression of gene networks to control development, differentiation, and proliferation of target tissues and the pathological processes in endocrine-based cancers. Anti-progestins are a class of nuclear receptor ligands that act to antagonize PR by binding to the progesterone binding site within the PR-ligand binding domain. 
Recently, the role of progesterone in carcinogenesis has gained further clarity. Mechanistically, published data suggest that progesterone promotes oncogenic progression and maintenance of stem cells, creating a reservoir of pre-malignant cells to seed metastasis. Initial evidence for this tumorigenic role is derived from longitudinal studies of the use of hormone replacement therapy in menopausal women. As shown in the figure below, these studies determined that supplemental estrogen was associated with a 23% decrease in cancer risk, whereas supplemental progesterone was associated with a 25% increase in cancer risk. The results demonstrated that women who were consistently exposed to progesterone had a higher risk of developing breast cancer than those who did not. This finding was confirmed by published data wherein mice treated with progesterone exhibited enhanced breast tumor growth whereas progesterone receptor inhibition via genetic knockdown conversely inhibited tumor growth.

As shown in the figure above, PR can be activated by ligand (progesterone) or ligand-independent (growth factor-mediated) mechanisms. Consistent with other steroid hormone receptor family members, PR is heavily post-translationally modified and thus acts as a molecular sensor for abnormally elevated or active signaling pathways. Little overlap exists between PR transcriptomes assayed in normal relative to neoplastic cells. In cancer cells, post-translational modifications (namely, phosphorylation and SUMOylation) via members of the growth factor signaling cascade create unique PR species whose altered behavior as ligand-dependent transcription factors is predicted to impact tumor initiation and progression. Due to the breadth of post-translational modifications of PR, there is limited selective mutational pressure to modify PR itself - thus, PR mutations are rare. However, when present, the PR mutations have a profound impact on PR activity and tumorigenesis.

The progesterone receptor as a mechanism of resistance 
Recently, progesterone receptor has emerged as anti-estrogen resistance mechanism. Long term exposure of cancer cells to anti-estrogens results in a complex resistance profile that limits the utility of standard of care anti-estrogen and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors. Mechanisms of resistance include mutations in the estrogen receptor (ESR1) estrogen binding domain and ER pathway signaling (e.g., MAPK, PI3Kα/mTOR proteins and associated signaling pathways). The prevalence of resistance mutations is associated with PR enrichment and activity. Based on our preclinical data and recent published data, we believe therapeutic inhibition of PR with either ONA-XR alone or in combination with anti-estrogens and/or CDK4/6 inhibitors may result in the impaired growth or death of resistant cells. 
Limitations of other PR antagonists 
Anti-progestins, the therapeutic inhibitors of PR, were first developed as oral contraceptives to block the maturation of the endometrium and subsequent ovulation. The first commercially available anti-progestin, Korlym (mifepristone), is a steroid derivative that acts both as a competitive progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist and as a partial PR agonist, depending on the physiological milieu. Mifepristone is approved for controlling hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult Cushing’s syndrome associated with Type 2 diabetes. Mifepristone was also clinically evaluated in breast and ovarian carcinomas, and while showing evidence of efficacy in clinical studies, mifepristone was also associated with off-target glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulation leading to cortisolemia and rare cases of cholestasis. In order to optimize PR antagonism while minimizing off-target activities, additional anti-progestins—including ulipristal, telapristone, lonaprisan and onapristone—were developed and evaluated in gynecological cancer. 
Unique Properties of Onapristone – Stereochemical Basis 
Note: AR: androgen receptor; C-13: carbon 13; n.a.: not applicable;1L mBCa: first-line metastatic breast cancer. 
ONA-XR differentiation 
Onapristone is a competitive PR antagonist that has no intrinsic activity for activating the receptor. As such, onapristone is also termed a “full” PR antagonist (inhibitor). Based on published data, all other anti-progestins that have reached the clinic demonstrate partial PR agonism. This differentiation may have a structural basis. It is well established that high energy, conformationally complex chemicals have improved selectivity and target affinity relative to low energy, flat counterparts. As shown above, all other anti-progestins have a roughly planar ring, low energy, A thru D conformation. In contrast, onapristone shows an inversion of stereochemistry at the C-13 methyl group that results in a high energy, chair conformation. This structural property is unique among clinically evaluated anti-progestins and may be important for onapristone’s full PR antagonist properties, as shown below.

Classic in vitro models have provided limited benefit in determining PR agonist versus antagonist properties. As the cost of gene expression profiling has decreased considerably over the last decade, it is now feasible to run comparative studies to determine how compounds are affecting the expression, positively or negatively, of target genes. Afhuppe et al (2009) conducted the first such study comparing anti-progestins in a gene array panel. T47D breast cancer cells (ER+, PR+) were grown in 2D, stimulated with estrogen (estradiol), and treated with anti-
progestins. An Affymetrix® gene chip analysis of the cells was then conducted to determine transcriptional activity on the level of target genes. Onapristone demonstrated the purest PR antagonist activity as indicated downregulation (green blocks) of almost all PR target genes analyzed, whereas mifepristone had a transcriptional profile closer to R5020, which is pure progesterone.

Anti-progestin clinical trial data 
In subjects with breast cancer, clinical trials with mifepristone, lonapristone and onapristone demonstrated partial responses. Onapristone clinical efficacy in breast cancer was studied in two Phase 1-2 clinical studies treating hormone therapy-naïve and tamoxifen-resistant metastatic breast cancer, while the safety component of a third Phase 1-2 study has been reported by Cottu et al. (2018). The earlier onapristone trials in breast cancer dosed orally with a simple solid dosage form (an “immediate release” or “IR” form; onapristone IR; ONA-IR), ONA-IR 100mg once per day (QD), for periods exceeding 12 months. The third breast cancer study used the extended release form, ONA-XR, dosed at 50mg twice per day (BID). Robertson et al (1999) reported a 67% clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as tumor shrinkage or tumor growth stabilization lasting for more than 6 months, while Jonat et al (2002) reported a 49% CBR. Both studies, therefore, indicated that onapristone could have a clinically meaningful impact on treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer. Clinical development of ONA-IR for use in reproductive medicine and benign gynecological conditions was discontinued by the original sponsor (Schering AG), possibly due to concerns around drug-induced liver injury. 
The extensive use of anti-estrogens, together with efficacy limits with earlier anti-progestins, has led to renewed interest in anti-progestins as therapies for breast and gynecologic cancer, as well as for uterine fibroids and endometriosis. Compared to earlier anti-progestin clinical trials, we believe we have a better tolerated formulation of onapristone (ONA-XR) and we will be able to better identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from anti-progestin therapy through the incorporation of biomarkers in our trials. 
Our current opportunities for ONA-XR 
Within the G7 (EU5, Japan, US) countries, it is estimated that there are over 362,000 patients living with metastatic breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer. Up to 70% of these patients are expected to be progesterone receptor positive and would potentially be eligible for treatment with ONA-XR.

Resistance to anti-estrogen therapy in breast cancer 
We have chosen PR antagonism in breast cancer as our initial therapeutic focus due to the well-documented biology of PR signaling as a mechanism of resistance to anti-estrogen therapy in patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Hormone-dependent breast cancer cells express estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone receptors (PR) that allow the cells to grow in the presence of the hormones estrogen and/or progesterone. Published data suggests that PR signaling is predominantly required for breast cancer cell renewal (i.e., stemness) and metastatic spread, whereas ER is predominantly required for breast cancer cell proliferation. By combining anti-progestin and anti-estrogen therapy, we have shown preclinically that breast cancer cell growth, renewal, and spread can be mitigated. Based on these data, we believe that ONA-XR, in combination with current standard-of-care anti-estrogens, has the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes. 
Breast cancer overview 
Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women, impacting 2.1 million women globally each year, and causing the greatest number of cancer-related deaths among women. In 2018, it is estimated that 627,000 women died from breast cancer worldwide — that is approximately 15% of all cancer deaths among women according to the World Health Organization. According to the American Cancer Society, the prevalence of women in the United States living with adjuvant, first line metastatic, or second/third line metastatic breast cancer are an estimated 250,000, 75,000, and 35,000 respectively. 
Breast cancer treatment is primarily determined by the presence or absence of three proteins: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2. The presentation of these proteins determines the subtype of breast cancer, which helps determine the optimal form of treatment for the patient. Patients who are ER+,PR+,HER2- are considered to be hormone receptor positive (i.e., hormone-dependent) and represent about 70% of breast cancers. HER2+ patients and triple negative patients (ER-,PR-,HER2-) represent the remaining 30% of breast cancers. 
Estrogen-deprivation (anti-estrogen) therapy is the core treatment modality in patients with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer according to NCCN Guidelines®. Anti-estrogen therapy options for postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer include: 
•Selective ER modulators (SERM): tamoxifen 
•ER antagonists: fulvestrant 
•Selective nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors: anastrozole and letrozole 
•Steroidal aromatase inhibitors: exemestane 
In addition, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors are rapidly transforming the care of patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. There are currently three CDK4/6 inhibitors that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration: Ibrance, Kisqali, and Verzenio. It is generally recommended to use the combination of a CDK4/6 inhibitor along with an aromatase inhibitor (i.e., letrozole) for first line locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer treatment. 
Illustrative breast cancer treatment landscape 
Note: ORR: overall response rate; PFS: progression free survival. 
Upon first line disease progression, second line therapy is most often fulvestrant (anti-estrogen) or fulvestrant plus alpelisib (Piqray), a PI3Kα inhibitor, if the patients have PIK3CA-mutated hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Fulvestrant plus Piqray was FDA approved in 2019 based on a Phase III trial of 572 patients that demonstrated a progression free survival (PFS) of 11.0 months vs. 5.7 months in the Piqray plus fulvestrant arm compared with fulvestrant alone (HR, 0.65, 95% CI 0.50–0.85). However, a total of 25% of patients discontinued Piqray plus fulvestrant therapy due to toxicities, thus, emphasizing the need for novel agents. Upon progression on second line therapy, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, including everolimus (Afinitor), plus anti-estrogen based regimen or chemotherapy is administered. One key limitation of both the Afinitor and Piqray studies is the lack of data for the role of these agents after prior CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. Most patients progress on these treatments and ultimately develop resistance. At that time, patients typically live for less than two years. 
Preclinical data 
The female ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone are master regulators of normal breast development and play a key role in breast cancer. Acting through ER and PR, estrogen and progesterone play complex, essential, and coordinated roles in the development of the lobular alveolar epithelial structures of the normal breast during puberty, the normal menstrual cycle, and pregnancy. It is likely that these actions become subverted in the development of breast cancer, implicating both estrogen and progesterone in the development and progression of this disease. Breast cancer is acknowledged to be a hormone-dependent disease and most breasts express ER and/or 
PR. PR is expressed in humans as two major forms, progesterone receptor A (PR-A) and progesterone receptor B (PR-B), in normal cells and in certain malignant tissues. PR-A and PR-B mediate the effects of progesterone by association with a range of co-regulatory proteins and progesterone-regulated gene promoters. Over the past few decades, the estrogen receptor signaling pathway remains the most effective treatment for the management of ER+ breast cancer. Treatments include the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen that binds to ER and prevents its activation, and aromatase inhibitors that block endogenous hormone synthesis. 
Recent published data suggests that progesterone receptor may function as an anti-estrogen resistance mechanism. Long term exposure of cancer cells to anti-estrogens results in a complex resistance profile that limits the utility of standard of care anti-estrogen and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Mechanisms of resistance include mutations in estrogen receptor gene (ESR1) and ER pathway signaling (MAPK, PI3Kα, mTOR), as 20-35% of ER+,PR+,HER2-metastatic breast tumors are ESR1 mutated. The prevalence of resistance mutations is correlated with PR enrichment and activity. We have presented data showing that therapeutic inhibition of PR with either onapristone alone or in combination with anti-estrogens and/or CDK4/6 inhibitors results in the impaired growth or death of resistant cells. 
As shown below, estrogen receptor (ESR1) mutational profiles of tumor biopsies were taken before and after prolonged treatment with anti-estrogen (fulvestrant) and CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib) therapy. ESR1Y537S mutations are enriched by the end of therapy and are associated with worse outcomes in patients. To determine the effect of ESR1 mutations, wild type (ESR1) and mutant (ESR1Y537S and ESR1Y537N) estrogen receptors were overexpressed in the T47D breast cancer cell line. The orange box denotes that both the PR-A and PR-B isoforms of progesterone receptor demonstrated increased expression upon exposure to the mutant form of ESR1. The increased expression of PR was found to be correlated with enhanced PR activity. To establish that ESR1Y537S cells require PR for growth and dual ER-PR inhibition (i.e., complete hormone blockade) results in growth inhibition, an ex vivo organoid model was conducted using the rapidly proliferating, CDK4/6 inhibitor resistant WHIM20 cell line. Organoid data demonstrates that dual blockade of ER and PR via treatment with fulvestrant and onapristone results in growth inhibition in a cell model that is intended to mimic human disease.

Addition of Onapristone to Standard of Care Enhances Tumor Regression 
Our hypothesis is that complete hormone blockade via downregulation of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) signaling pathways, and their compensatory pathways, including CDK4/6, will lead to enhanced therapeutic outcomes in patients. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model to evaluate the efficacy of the antiprogestin onapristone in combination with fulvestrant (antiestrogen) and palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) in PDX mouse models established from ER and PR positive bone metastasis of breast cancer. Two PDX models were tested, one with low level (data not shown) and one with high level of PR expression (data shown below). In the PDX model with high expression of PR, treatment by onapristone combined with palbociclib and fulvestrant resulted in enhanced tumor regressions. 
All treatment arms were well tolerated. Blood and tumor samples were taken at the end of the study from both experiments. Different biological analyses will be performed to analyze ER/PR signaling by protein and RNAseq analyses. 
Results from the experiment with the PR High Expression PDX are shown above. Treatment by onapristone alone resulted in a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 42%, while the combination onapristone (10 mg/kg) + palbociclib (75 mg/kg) resulted in a TGI of 67% and the triple combo onapristone + palbociclib + fulvestrant (5 mg/mouse) in a TGI of 92% with 6/7 xenografts showing tumor regression. The statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad software. Plasma and tumor samples were taken at the end of the study from 5 xenografts/group for further analysis. 
Resistance to hormone-dependent gynecologic cancer 
Gynecologic cancer overview 
Ovarian and endometrial cancer represent the majority of gynecologic cancers. It is estimated that there are more than 22,000 new cases of ovarian cancer and 61,000 new cases of endometrial cancer annually, resulting in 14,000 ovarian and 12,000 endometrial deaths in the United States (US) every year. As of 2019, it is estimated that there are 235,000 patients living with ovarian cancer and over 770,000 patients living with endometrial cancer in the US. By applying PR positivity (PR+) rates to the 2019 prevalence count, it is estimated that there are 300,000 patients with recurrent gynecologic cancer in the US, 130,000 of whom are PR+. 
Maximal surgical debulking and platinum chemotherapy are the cornerstone treatments for primary gynecologic cancer. The aim of surgery is to confirm diagnosis, define extent of disease spread (staging), and resect all visible tumor tissue. The goal of cytoreductive surgery is removal of the entire tumor burden to achieve either complete removal of the tumor upon visual inspection (complete cytoreductive surgery) or a residual tumor of < 1 cm (optimal cytoreductive surgery). Even centers experienced in ovarian tumor cytoreductive surgery achieve optimal resection in only 50% of patients. Patients with incomplete/suboptimal cytoreductive surgery are at a significantly higher risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. 
Following primary treatment for gynecologic cancer, the relapse rate is approximately 20-25% for early-stage disease and 70% for advanced (spread beyond primary site) disease. The survival curve after recurrence never plateaus, which means that the goal of treatment for recurrent gynecologic cancer is controlling the disease and disease-related symptoms, limiting treatment-related toxicity, and maintaining or improving quality of life. Primary or secondary resistance is the main cause for diminished effectiveness over time of platinum-based chemotherapy, contributing to the dismal outcome of advanced patients whose 5-year survival rate is less than 30%. Patients who are hormone receptor positive will often receive anti-estrogen therapy in the recurrent setting; however, anti-estrogen efficacy is modest in this setting. In general, treatment of recurrent disease is palliative and is initiated with the goals of controlling disease-related symptoms, limiting treatment-related toxicity, maintaining or improving quality of life, delaying time to progression, and prolonging survival. 
Illustrative hormone-dependent gynecologic treatment landscape 
Reasons Why Such a Therapy is Needed 
Cytoreductive surgery followed by combination platinum and taxane chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for most gynecologic cancer patients regardless of type. Outside of DNA repair deficient high grade serous ovarian cancer, there are limited treatment options for all other forms of ovarian and endometrial cancer. Given the above-mentioned 5-year survival rate of less than 30%, there is a critical need to identify a targeted treatment in the recurrent setting. Ovarian and endometrial cancer remains a serious, life threatening, unmet medical need, resulting in more than 26,000 estimated deaths in the US every year. 
Preclinical data 
PR in Endometrial Cancer 
Progesterone receptor (PR)-targeted therapies are modestly active in patients with endometrial cancer, which may be attributed to an evolving understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of PR-targeted therapies for this disease. In the normal endometrium, estrogen drives proliferation of the endometrial glandular epithelium, whereas progesterone counteracts the effects of estrogen. Progesterone acts by binding to the PR and has a dual role through both genomic and nongenomic pathways. Anti-progestins such as onapristone have recently been shown to be efficacious in mouse models of uterine cancer, suggesting that PR blockade may be an effective approach for treating uterine cancer.

It has been reported that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) play a dual role in PR subcellular trafficking and aid in the rapid nuclear association of PR via Serine 294 (S294) phosphorylation in response to growth factors and in response to ligand (i.e., progesterone). In Huang et al 2017, PR+ endometrial cancer cells were implanted in mice and upon tumor engraftment were treated with onapristone and/or trametinib, a MEK inhibitor. If progesterone receptor does coordinate endometrial cancer response through MAPK via MEK signaling, then the MEK inhibitor, trametinib, should be anticipated to enhance onapristone sensitivity through blocking the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated PR. The study demonstrates that PR+ endometrial xenografts are sensitive to both onapristone and trametinib alone, and exhibit synergy when combined, indicating a rationale to develop onapristone alone or in combination with a MEK inhibitor for PR+ endometrial cancer. 
PR in Ovarian cancer 
Progesterone and progesterone receptors (PR) are increasingly gaining attention for their emerging role as critical regulators of breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. Progesterone is a steroid hormone that is produced primarily by the corpus luteum in the ovaries during the second half of the menstrual cycle or luteal phase. Cyclical hormone exposure beginning at menarche and ending in menopause occurs monthly and regulates the growth and differentiation of specialized tissues within the reproductive tract and breast tissues. Until recently, little was known about the relative distribution of PR within the subtypes of ovarian tumors. In a cohort of 504 ovarian tumors, Diep et al (2013) reported that 35% of the tumors were progesterone receptor-positive (PR+) and that PR expression is associated with better outcomes, indicating a potential role for hormone therapy in PR+ ovarian cancer. Importantly, several subtypes were found to be highly enriched for PR. Retrospective studies evaluating the association of total PR expression and progression-free disease survival support the concept that subsets of PR+ ovarian tumors are highly sensitive to hormones and thus more likely to respond to endocrine therapy. 
Development of extended release formulation 
Precedent Formulation – Onapristone IR (ONA-IR) 
Onapristone was originally developed in an immediate release or “IR” form (onapristone IR; ONA-IR). ONA-IR was first evaluated as an oral contraceptive and was dosed up to 400 mg/day for periods of 7 days during single ovulatory cycles in healthy female subjects. Later, ONA-IR 100 mg/day was administered for periods exceeding 12 months in breast cancer studies. Discontinuation of ONA-IR development by the original sponsor, Schering AG, is thought to have been due to the observation of liver test abnormalities and the perceived risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) during a Phase 2 study of ONA-IR as first line therapy in breast cancer subjects. Liver test elevations were considered a concern for the planned contraception and benign gynecological indications (e.g., uterine fibroids, 
endometriosis). However, renewed interest in anti-progestin therapy for PR-positive malignancies has led to the consideration of new strategies for reducing potential hepatotoxic effects of onapristone. 
In developing new strategies for anti-progestin use, one consideration is that mifepristone, ulipristal, telapristone, and onapristone all contain a 17-carbon steroid ring structure that is typical of steroids. Anti-progestins with steroidal cores often display significant cross-reactivity with closely related steroid receptors, namely, androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). This functional overlap is partly responsible for the side effects linked with the steroidal drugs, which themselves carry a potential DILI risk. Because onapristone binds to GRs less efficiently than to PRs, one strategy to minimize liver test elevations was to seek a new onapristone formulation that yielded steady state pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters where: (a) Cmax is lower than the Cmax associated with ONA-IR 100mg QD (to target a reduced risk for LFT elevations); and (b) Cmin is at least approximately equal to the Cmin associated ONA-IR 100mg QD (to target at least equivalent, sustained suppression of PR activity). Various formulation strategies were evaluated and a 50mg, BID (twice-daily), extended release tablet (onapristone XR; ONA-XR) was selected to be the second-generation dosage form for the clinical evaluation of onapristone in PR-positive cancers.

Novel Formulation – Onapristone XR 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for ONA-IR 100mg QD and ONA-XR 50mg BID were previously evaluated within a dose escalation component of a Phase 1-2 clinical study in female subjects with endometrial carcinoma, breast cancer or ovarian cancer. This study (Cottu et al 2018) reported that ONA-XR showed “Clinical benefit with excellent tolerance”, while defining a recommended phase 2 dose level of ONA-XR of 50mg, BID. The PK dataset from this clinical study enabled a direct comparison between Cmax and Cmin for ONA-IR 100mg QD and ONA-XR 50mg BID. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of ONA were estimated using standard noncompartmental methods and the nonparametric superposition tool in Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.3 (Certara Inc., Princeton, NJ). These methods assume linear pharmacokinetics from the first dose to steady state. Dosing with ONA-XR 50mg BID resulted in a steady-state Cmax almost 3 times lower than the Cmax for ONA-IR 100mg QD, while the steady-state Cmin for both formulations were similar: 829 ng/mL versus 790 ng/mL for ONA-IR versus ONA-XR, respectively. The findings of the Phase 1-2 PK and safety evaluation support that the recently developed, extended release form of onapristone appears to have achieved the PK goals of the formulation exercise. 
Completed clinical trials 
The initial IR formulation (ONA-IR), developed by Schering AG at various strengths, was dosed up to 400 mg/day in healthy volunteers and 100 mg/day for periods exceeding six months in oncology studies. Arno Therapeutics (Cranbury, NJ) subsequently developed onapristone extended release (“ONA-XR”) formulation and administered it in doses of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg ONA-XR BID for up to 52 weeks. We acquired ONA-XR from Arno Therapeutics. There are no associated future payments due to Arno.

Onapristone IR Clinical Data 
Across first and second line metastatic breast cancer, onapristone IR (ONA-IR) demonstrated clinical activity comparable to anti-estrogen standard of care. We believe that by selecting for PR+ status and combining ONA-XR, an improved form of ONA-IR, with anti-estrogen therapy to promote complete hormone blockade, we will potentially generate superior efficacy data compared to the current standard of care treatment options. 
First Line Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer 
A Phase 2 study investigating onapristone (ONA-IR, 100 mg/day as a single daily dose) as first-line endocrine therapy in patients with breast cancer was conducted as an investigator-initiated study, as shown below. Nineteen patients, either with locally advanced breast cancer (n = 12) or who were elderly with primary breast cancer and considered unfit for standard of care (n = 7) received ONA-IR. In 17 of the 19 patients, tumors expressed ER while 12 of 18 tumors tested expressed PR. 
Among 18 patients who were evaluable for response, 10 had a partial response and 2 had stable disease (“SD”) for six months or more. The median duration of objective response and SD was 70 weeks. Ten patients were ER-positive/PR-positive, of whom 7 achieved partial response (PR; tumor shrinkage of >30%) and 1 had SD. Overall, the clinical benefit rate was considered comparable to the current standard of care of letrozole (anti-estrogen) and palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor).

Second Line Metastatic Breast Cancer 
A non-randomized, open label, multicenter Phase 2 study was conducted at 13 sites in Germany and the United Kingdom, as shown below. The study goal was to investigate the efficacy and safety of ONA-IR when given 100 mg/day to post-menopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had progressed on tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator therapy. The study was also designed to assess the influence of onapristone on the levels of relevant endocrine parameters (cortisol, androstenedione, estrone and estradiol). 
Of the 101 evaluable patients, 1 had a complete response (“CR”), 9 had a partial response, and 39 had SD for three months or more. The median duration of response was 11 months. Median time to progression was 4 months. 
In second line metastatic breast cancer, ONA-IR exhibited monotherapy activity in patients who had progressed while on tamoxifen. In this trial, patients were not screened for progesterone receptor positive (PR+) status, meaning that only 60% of enrolled patients would have expected to be PR+ based upon historical prevalence in this setting and therefore derive clinical benefit from ONA-IR. Therefore, this trial potentially under-represents the likely true clinical benefit of ONA-IR had patients been stratified for the partial response biomarker. Despite administering a monotherapy without patient selection for PR+, ONA-IR demonstrated comparable clinical activity to standard of care anti-estrogens (FUL), CDK4/6 inhibitors (PAL), and the combination of the two (FUL + PAL).

Onapristone XR Clinical Data 
Overall, over 140 subjects received at least a single dose of ONA-XR across both healthy volunteer and cancer trials through December 31, 2021. Multiple drug product formulations of onapristone have been developed for evaluation throughout the clinical development program. Clinical development was initiated with a 10 mg immediate release (IR) capsule. An IR tablet formulation (10mg, 25 mg) and extended release (XR) tablet formulation (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg) were also developed. The tablets have been administered as a single tablet or in multiples in order to obtain the desired dosage. The XR tablet has been used in ongoing safety and efficacy studies. ONA-XR 50 mg BID (twice-per-day) is the recommended dose for our ongoing investigational trials.

As of December 31, 2021 thirty-two subjects (22%) of the total onapristone safety set (n = 144) experienced any treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE). Adverse events were generally consistent across all defined groups. Thirteen subjects experienced Grade 3 or Grade 4 TEAEs that were deemed related to ONA-XR with no correlation across dosing groups. The most common drug-related TEAEs included fatigue, abdominal pain, and an increase in gamma-glutamyltransferase. These events are generally consistent with disease progression and/or prior anti-progestin experience, including onapristone. In addition, there were no clinically significant post-dose changes in electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, or safety laboratory results. 

Primary Breast Cancer
In a multicenter, open label, window of opportunity trial, Bellet et al (2021) enrolled 10 adult patients with ER+, PR+, HER2- breast cancer and Ki-67 ≥ 15%. Patients received ONA-XR tablets of 50 mg BID for a short course of endocrine therapy before surgery. Assessment of the treatment effects was possible for the 10 patients who successfully completed the protocol and the 10 paired samples (100%) were analyzed. Main patient characteristics were mean age 68, mean tumor size 20.2 mm, stage I (40%) and grade 2 (100%). No patients achieved a CCCR (cell-cycle complete response). Tumor Ki-67 expression decreased, was stable and increased in 6, 1 and 3 patients, respectively. Mean percentage suppression of Ki-67 was 19.58%. Overall, no statistically significant change was observed in Ki-67 between paired samples (p=0.234). Baseline IHC PgR (%) expression correlated with Ki-67 decrease (r = -0.60). Mean percentage suppression of Ki-67 for tumors with IHC PgR expression ≥90% (N=4) and <90% (N=6) was -62.0% and +8.7%, respectively. Six (60%) patients reported adverse events at any grade. Most 
common grade 1 or 2 adverse events were post procedural pain, dry mouth and GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) increased. Grade 3 reversible GGT and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) increase occurred in one patient.
Advanced, Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer 
In a multicenter, open label, Phase 1 trial, Cottu et al (2018) enrolled 52 adult patients with PR+ tumors, including 20 patients with breast cancer. Patients were randomized to five cohorts of ONA-XR tablets of 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 mg BID, or immediate release 100 mg QD until progressive disease or intolerability. All patients were heavily pre-treated; prior treatments included median (range): chemotherapy 4 (1–11), endocrine therapy 1 (1–7), biologic/small molecule therapy 1 (1–2), and radiotherapy 1 (1–3). Among the 20 heavily pre-treated breast cancer patients, no CR or partial response were observed, 7 patients had SD, including 3 patients with SD lasting for at least 24 weeks (15% clinical benefit rate). The number of prior therapies was 3, 7 and 7, respectively, for these 3 patients and 2 of these 3 patients had liver metastases at baseline. The study authors concluded that the new XR formulation of onapristone was well tolerated and resulted in meaningful clinical benefit in heavily pretreated patients with breast cancer. The only treatment-related serious adverse events were G3 LFT elevations (n = 4; 8%), all associated with disease progression in the liver as reviewed. These occurred across dose cohorts: 10 mg BID (AST increased, bilirubin increased), 20 mg BID (LFTs abnormal), and 40 mg BID (bilirubin increased). No relationship was found between adverse events and study drug exposure. No treatment-related deaths were reported. One patient died within 30 days of last dose (respiratory distress syndrome due to progressive lung metastases). No other significant adverse events attributable to the mechanism of action were recorded. 
Advanced, Recurrent Metastatic Gynecologic Cancers 
A Phase I dose escalation study of ONA-XR in breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer patients found all doses tested to be safe and well tolerated, with 50mg BID administered orally recommended as the Phase 2 dose. The most common treatment-related adverse events reported by investigators (>10%) were nausea, fatigue and constipation. In that Phase I study, 33% of ovarian and 25% of endometrial cancer patients were seen to have sustained disease control. 
Focusing on the ovarian cancer (n=13) subpopulation, all PR+ ovarian patients were heavily pre-treated; prior treatments included median (range): chemotherapy 4 (2–6), and treatment lines in metastatic setting 4 (2-10). All patients were platinum resistant. Clinical data is shown below. 
Phase 1 ovarian cancer data 
Advanced, Recurrent Granulosa Cell Tumor of the Ovary 
Granulosa cell tumors (GCT) of the ovary is a rare form of ovarian cancer. These tumors account for 2-5% of all ovarian malignancies and it is estimated that there are approximately 5,000 patients with recurrent disease in the US and EU. 
Almost all GCT tumors are progesterone receptor (PR) positive, whereas about 50% are estrogen receptor (ER) positive. These tumors often produce estrogen and progesterone, which can cause symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding or breast tenderness. Further, PR expression is correlated with worse outcomes in GCT patients. GCT tumors have a low mitotic ratio and few actionable mutations, which limits the applicability of chemotherapeutic and precision medicine approaches. Platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended as the first line of treatment for patients in the metastatic setting. Following progression to metastatic disease, patients typically cycle through chemotherapy, antihormonal treatments, and cytoreductive surgeries. There are currently no FDA treatments for GCT tumors of the ovary, and few, if any, open clinical trials. 
Given that GCT tumors are hormone driven, it is plausible that complete hormone blockade via antiprogestin and antiestrogen therapy may provide a therapeutic benefit to patients. In 2019, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center initiated an Investigator-sponsored Trial to evaluate onapristone extended release (ONA-XR) in women with GCT of the ovary who had progressed on multiple prior therapies. 
Phase 2 data evaluating ONA-XR in late line GCT of the ovary 
Fourteen patients with progesterone receptor positive (PR+) GCT of the ovary were enrolled in the stage I trial, with thirteen of those patients completing at least one full cycle of treatment. 
Four of the 14 patients (29%) had clinical benefit lasting at least 24 weeks, and 5 additional patients (64%) experienced stable disease as best response. Importantly, two patients (14%) remain on treatment after 12 months. To date, no significant treatment-related adverse events have been identified. The most common treatment-related adverse events reported were nausea, fatigue, and constipation. 
Based on the Phase 2 monotherapy data presented above, a combination arm seeking to enroll 25 patients was activated to evaluate the combination of ONA-XR with Arimidex (anastrozole), a selective nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase inhibitors are commonly used to treat recurrent granulosa cell tumors based on low response rates to chemotherapy and historically high rates of ER/PR expression within these tumors. However, objective response rate for anastrozole remains low and was found to be 2.5% in a recent clinical trial (Banerjee, JCO, 2018). We seek to test the combination of ONA-XR and anastrozole to enhance the response rate in patients with PR+ GCT tumors of the ovary. 
We have FDA Fast Track designation for PR+ ovarian cancer 
In August 2020, we received FDA Fast Track designation for ONA-XR in PR+ ovarian cancer. Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of therapies for serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Programs with Fast Track designation may benefit from early and frequent communications with the FDA, potential priority review and the ability to submit a rolling application for regulatory review. Fast Track designation applies to both the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. If any of our product candidates receive Fast Track designation but do not continue to meet the criteria for Fast Track designation, or if our clinical trials are delayed, suspended or terminated, or put on clinical hold due to unexpected adverse events or issues with clinical supply, we will not receive the benefits associated with the Fast Track program. Furthermore, Fast Track designation does not change the standards for approval. Fast Track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA’s priority review procedures. 
Clinical development plan for ONA-XR 
The PR signaling pathway has been implicated in female hormone-dependent cancers, including breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. Our clinical development effort for ONA-XR, a selective and potentially potent small molecule antagonist of PR, will initially focus on indications where there is evidence suggesting PR-mediated signaling contributes to resistance and disease progression. In 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial in collaboration with Jefferson Health to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Arimidex (anastrozole) in PR+ endometrial cancer and preliminary data is expected in mid-2022. Also, in 2020 we initiated a Phase 0 trial of ONA-XR in a window of opportunity study in primary breast cancer, and we reported preliminary data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2021. In 2021, a Phase 1b/2 investigator-sponsored trial was initiated in collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Ibrance (palbociclib) and Femara (leterozole) in first line (1L) metastatic breast cancer patients with biochemically recurrent disease, defined as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) positive. This is potentially a new clinical opportunity for the estimated 20% of 1L patients who are at high risk of early disease progression on Ibrance plus Femara combination therapy and Phase 1b data is expected in mid-2022. In 2021, the first stage of a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial initiated by MSK to evaluate ONA-XR in recurrent granulosa cell tumors (GCT) of the ovary was completed. In July 2021, MSK initiated the second stage of this trial evaluating ONA-XR in combination with Arimidex, and preliminary data is expected in the second half of 2022. Also in 2021, a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial was initiated in collaboration with Wisconsin Oncology Network (WON) to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Faslodex (fulvestrant) in second line (2L) or third line (3L) metastatic breast cancer. This trial is intended to evaluate potential ONA-XR plus Faslodex drug synergy after treatment failure of CDK4/6 and/or PIK3α inhibitors, and preliminary data is expected in the second half of 2022. In 2022, WON intends to initiate a sub-study of its Phase 2 trial in 2L/3L metastatic breast cancer that will evaluate the uptake of radiolabeled progesterone (F-FFNP) via PET imaging in breast tumors.
CLDN6xCD3 bispecific antibody program: CLDN6xCD3 bsAb 
Background CLDN6 
Claudin 6 (CLDN6) is an oncofetal tight junction protein involved in the cell-to-cell adhesion of epithelial and endothelial cell sheets. Although silenced in healthy adult human tissues, CLDN6 expression has been found in ovarian, gastric, pediatric, and other cancer tissues and can lead to a poor prognosis. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) discovery against CLDN6 has been encumbered by the high homology of endogenously expressed claudin 9 (CLDN9), which varies from CLDN6 by only 3 amino acids in the extracellular domain.
Proposed mechanism of action 
Rationale for bispecific antibody 
Cytotoxic T cells are considered to be the most potent effector cells of the immune system. As a consequence, broad T cell activation can lead to significant and sometimes lethal side effects. Therefore, to harness the potential of cytotoxic T cells, therapeutic strategies seek to pair T cell activation with drug targets that are restricted to cancer tissue so as to avoid unwanted toxicity. CLDN6 expression is restricted to various cancer types (i.e., a tumor specific antigen or TSA), making it an ideal target to help T cells recognize and eliminate cancer cells. Recently, a class of bispecific antibodies (TSAxCD3) with a native immunoglobulin format has emerged that can efficiently trigger T cell–mediated killing of tumor cells by linking a T cell to a tumor cell and activating the CD3/t cell receptor complex, as shown above. 
CLDN6 expression in cancer versus normal tissue 
Source: Cancer RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA); normal tissue RNAseq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. 
Preclinical data 
CLDN6xCD3 bsAb, is an anti-CD3 x anti-Claudin 6 (CLDN6xCD3) antigen bispecific monoclonal antibody (bsAbs) that is intended to redirect T-cell-mediated lysis toward malignant cells expressing CLDN6. As shown below, preclinical studies demonstrate that CLDN6xCD3 bsAb exhibits selectivity for CLDN6 over CLDN9 and 
that CLDN6xCD3 bsAb mediates strong T-cell activation and specific lysis of cells expressing CLDN6. In vivo studies with a prototype bispecific of CLDN6xCD3 bsAb demonstrated dose-dependent tumor regressions in an established ovarian cancer xenograft model with an intact immune system. We expect to select a candidate to support IND-enabling studies for CLDN6xCD3 bsAb in the second half of 2022.
CLDN6 x CD3 bispecific retains selectivity of parental mAb 
Figure above illustrates the results of a binding assay showing that Context’s Claudin 6 monoclonal and bispecific antibodies bind to Claudin 6 preferentially over other Claudin proteins. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK-293T) cells were transiently transfected with DNA for the indicated Claudin protein along with GFP (pUC) for 22 hours. 
Context bispecifics activate T cells against CLDN6+ cells 
Figure above illustrates the results of immune assays showing that Context’s CLDN6 x CD3 bispecific antibodies activate T cells and drive T-cell dependent cytotoxicity. All bispecific formats contain the same CD3 cassette. Activity was measured after 72 hours of treatment. 
Comparison of CLDN6 development programs 
We have performed head-to-head in vitro studies comparing internally developed CLDN6 monoclonal antibodies and those from BioNTech and Xencor. Antibodies for BioNTech and comparative data for Xencor were derived from publicly available reports published independent of the Company and may differ in material ways from the actual antibody that is in development. 
The results presented in the below table have been derived from publicly available reports of preclinical studies and clinical trials run independently of our trials or meta-analyses of such clinical results. We have not performed any head-to-head trials comparing any of these other therapies with CLDN6xCD3 bsAb. As such, the results of these other clinical trials may not be comparable to clinical results for CLDN6xCD3 bsAb. The design of these other 
trials vary in material ways from the design of the clinical trials for CLDN6xCD3 bsAb. For further information and to understand these material differences, you should read the relevant reports or meta-analyses. 
While the BioNTech and Xencor’s product candidates are not intended to compete with our CLDN6xCD3 bsAb, it is useful to compare the symptomatic results achieved by their devices and approaches a good proxy to understand the adoption of these therapies. 

 | Context | Xencor | BioNTech 
Program | CLDN6xCD3 bsAb | CLDN6xCD3 bsAb | BNT211 BNT142 
Antibody Format | Bispecific CLDN6xCD3 | Bispecific CLDN6xCD3 | CLDN6 CAR-T, and CLDN6xCD3 (bi(sFc))
Stage | Preclinical | Preclinical | Phase 1, Phase 1 
Status | Active | Active | Active 
Selectivity CLDN6:9 | >100x | 10x | 7x 

Other preclinical programs 
In addition to our product candidates, we are leveraging our knowledge in hormone-dependent cancer to pursue discovery stage research programs. 
In November 2015, the Company entered into a patent license agreement, as amended, (the “Drexel License Agreement”) with Drexel University (“Drexel”) for license rights to patents for certain intellectual property and know-how related to certain Sigma1 technology. As part of a strategic review of our pipeline, we have recently notified Drexel that we are terminating the Drexel License Agreement, effective as of April 27, 2022.
Our collaboration and license agreements 
In March 2020, we entered into a manufacturing and development agreement with Tyligand Bioscience (Shanghai) Limited for ONA-XR (the “Tyligand Process Development Agreement”) that is intended to enhance our ability to meet manufacturing demands for commercial launch and expand our clinical trial footprint into Greater China. Under the terms of the agreement, Tyligand is responsible for ONA-XR manufacturing process optimization. As a part of the agreement, Tyligand is eligible to receive development milestone payments of $0.8 million and a certain number of warrants exercisable for common stock upon successful completion of the manufacturing development plan, $2.0 million upon the completion of scale-up of the first cumulative 100 kilograms of the GMP-grade compound and $3.0 million upon our completion of scale-up of the first cumulative 300 kilograms of the GMP-grade compound. We will also pay Tyligand a 1% royalty of net sales of finished product commercialized in any country (other than the People’s Republic of China, including Hong Kong and Macau) utilizing the compound substantially manufactured in accordance with the process and specifications outlined in this agreement. This agreement terminated in August of 2021, subject to certain surviving and ongoing obligations. Please note that the foregoing is a summary of the agreement and is therefore qualified in its entirety by reference to the agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and which is incorporated herein by reference.
In August of 2021, Tyligand achieved “successful completion” under the Tyligand Process Development Agreement as a result of Tyligand’s successful optimization of the ONA-XR manufacturing process. Because of this achievement, Tyligand has entered into a license agreement with us (the “Tyligand License Agreement”) whereby we have granted Tyligand an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ONA-XR in the People’s Republic of China, including Hong Kong and Macau (the “Tyligand Territory”), subject to Tyligand paying Context a mid-single digit royalty of net sales of ONA-XR in such countries. The royalty term of such exclusive license shall be the from period beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of ONA-XR in the Tyligand Territory and ending on the latest of (i) the sale of a generic product containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as ONA-XR in the Tyligand Territory, and (ii) fifteen (15) years after the date of the first commercial sale of ONA-XR in the Tyligand Territory. We have retained our global exclusive rights for ONA-XR for the remainder of the world. As a result of the completion of this milestone, Tyligand was granted a warrant to purchase 111,576 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $7.17 per share (which was automatically exercised and cancelled in 
connection with our initial public offering), we paid Tyligand $800,000, and Tyligand will be eligible to receive manufacturing and development milestone payments totaling up to $5.0 million upon the achievement of certain future milestones. The Tyligand License Agreement provides for termination in the event of (a) insolvency, (b) a material breach of the agreement, and (c) in the event that Tyligand does not meet certain regulatory milestones. Please note that the foregoing is a summary of the agreement and is therefore qualified in its entirety by reference to the agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.5 and which is incorporated herein by reference.
In April 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Integral for the exclusive worldwide rights (the “Integral License Agreement”) to certain Claudin 6 antibody patents in the field of bispecific antibodies. Under the terms of the license and development agreement, we are responsible for all costs associated with CLDN6xCD3 bsAb development as well as certain success-based payments, including milestone and royalty payments, to Integral. We paid an upfront license fee of $0.3 million and granted 418,559 shares of Series A Stock with a fair market value of approximately $2.8 million. As a part of the agreement, Integral will be eligible to receive development and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $55.3 million, sales milestone payments totaling up to $130 million, and tiered royalties of up to 12% of net sales of certain products developed under this agreement. We shall continue to pay royalties on a country-by-country and licensed-by-licensed product basis, until the later of: (i) the expiration of the patent covering such product in such territory, (ii) the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity granted with respect to a product in such territory and (iii) ten years from the first commercial sale of such product in such country. The agreement shall continue in full force and effect, until either (a) royalty payments for all products in all territories have expired or (b)(i) we provide written notice of termination, (ii) during three successive quarters we do not use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a product, (iii) if the agreement is breached or (iv) if a party goes bankrupt. Please note that the foregoing is a summary of the agreement and is therefore qualified in its entirety by reference to the agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and which is incorporated herein by reference.
Commercialization 
We retain worldwide development and commercialization rights for ONA-XR outside of Greater China and retain full worldwide development and commercialization rights to certain CLDN6 antibody patents in the field of bispecific antibodies. We periodically evaluate out-license opportunities for our product candidates, including our lead product candidate ONA-XR, and seek to identify drug candidates for novel indications and/or patient subpopulations with an oncology focus that we might in-license. Our commercial plans and strategy for each particular program may change as programs advance, markets change, and we receive more clinical data, and will depend on availability of current and future capital. 
Sales and marketing 
We currently have no sales, marketing, or commercial product distribution capabilities, and we may explore partnerships with larger pharmaceutical organizations to out-license our product candidates, including our lead product candidate ONA-XR. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. 
Manufacturing 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational product candidates, as well as for our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates. 
To date, we have obtained active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and drug product for our product candidates from several third party contract manufacturers. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our product candidates and intend to put in place additional framework agreements under which third-party contract 
manufacturers will generally provide us with necessary quantities of API and drug product on a project-by-project basis based on our development needs. 
As we advance our product candidates through development, we will consider our lack of redundant supply for the API and drug product for each of our product candidates to protect against any potential supply disruptions. 
We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop. 
Competition 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, the expertise of our executive and scientific team, research, clinical capabilities, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face increasing competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. 
Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or make our development more complicated. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety and convenience. 
For ONA-XR, our small molecule PR antagonist, we are aware of several companies developing PR antagonists, including Allergan, Evestra, and Gedeon Richter. To our knowledge, there are no PR antagonists approved for the treatment of cancer and the most advanced such PR antagonist is in a Phase 2 clinical trial. 
For CLDN6xCD3 bsAb, our CLDN6xCD3 bispecific antibody, we are aware of several companies developing antibodies against this target, including Abbvie, Amgen, Astellas, AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Chugai, I-Mab, NovaRock, and Xencor. These companies are developing CDLN6 products in naked antibody, bispecific, CAR-T, and mRNA vaccine formats. To our knowledge, BioNTech has the only CLDN6 product in clinical trials.
Intellectual property 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending our patent rights. We own the issued patent and patent applications relating to our first program and lead product candidate ONA-XR, and retain full worldwide development and commercialization rights to certain CLDN6 antibody patents in the field of bispecific antibodies. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States directed to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of oncology. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when 
available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own or license in the future; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 
As of March 14, 2022, our patent portfolio consisted of pending or issued patents that we own or license related to our ONA-XR product candidate and various other compounds and programs. Specifically, we owned four issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, one granted Canadian patent, two granted Chinese patents, one granted Japanese patent, three granted Australian patents, one granted Hong Kong patent, and 18 pending foreign patent applications, two of which are Australian applications, three of which are Canadian applications, two of which are Chinese applications, three of which are European regional patent applications, two of which are Hong Kong applications, one of which is a Mexican application, two of which are Japanese applications, two of which are Korean applications, and one international PCT application. 
More specifically with respect to ONA-XR, our issued U.S. patents in our owned portfolio described above have claims directed to our ONA-XR as pharmaceutical compositions, formulations, and related methods of use, and methods of making. These U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2034 and 2036, subject to any extensions or disclaimers. 
We also possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology. 
With respect to our product candidates and processes we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies. 
Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of oncology has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our product candidates, technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even our issued patents may not guarantee us the right to commercialize our product candidates, if approved. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from 
commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary product candidates, and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar products that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. 
Government Regulation 
Regulatory Pathway 
We expect that ONA-XR will be classified and regulated by the FDA as a drug. We expect that our CLDN6xCD3 bsAb will be classified and regulated by the FDA as a biologic. A new drug application (“NDA”) is required to introduce a drug into interstate commerce. A biologics license application (“BLA”) is required to introduce a biologic product into interstate commerce. The specific requirements of NDAs and BLAs include applicant information, product information, manufacturing information, pre-clinical data, clinical data, and labelling. The most important, time-consuming, and expensive aspect of preparing for a BLA or NDA is conducting clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The requirements of such clinical trials heavily influence the eventual allowable product label claims. The FDA has a performance goal as defined in the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of ten months for a standard submission and six months for priority review. It is not uncommon for NDAs and BLAs to require medical advisory board review prior to the FDA granting marketing approval. A facility inspection verifying the manufacturing systems is also usually performed prior to FDA approval. 
We have in the past used and intend to continue to utilize the services of third-party experts to supplement internal regulatory planning and implementation. 
Ongoing FDA Regulation 
After the FDA permits a product to enter commercial distribution, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply to our business operations, products and technologies. These include: 
•the FDA’s quality system regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
•labeling and marketing regulations which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated; 
•advertising and promotion requirements, including FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses and FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information; 
•restrictions on sale, distribution or use; 
•product establishment, registration and listing requirements and reporting requirements; 
•recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that a product would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; 
•an order of repair, replacement or refund; and 
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data. 
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. Manufacturers of biologic products and drug products like our product candidates are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and other state, local and foreign regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of any suppliers. 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: 
•warning letters, untitled letters, Form 483s, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
•recall or seizure of products; 
•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
•the FDA’s refusal of requests for approval of new products or indications for existing products; 
•the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; 
•withdrawing approvals that have already been granted; and 
•criminal prosecution. 
Privacy and Security Laws 
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information, including health information. Among others, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, (collectively referred to as HIPAA), establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information, or PHI, and require covered entities and business associates to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form, among other requirements. 
Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. Companies subject to HIPAA must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule which requires notification of affected patients and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and in certain cases of media outlets, in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI. The regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate. State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states, and HIPAA standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. 
Many states have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information, to which we are subject. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General may bring enforcement actions for violations as of July 1, 2020. The CCPA has been amended from time to time, and it remains unclear what, if any, further modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. 
We may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security, laws that place specific requirements on 
certain types of activities, such as data security and texting, and laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach. 
European Union member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the EEA and the United Kingdom, the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018, repealing its predecessor directive and increasing responsibility and liability of pharmaceutical and medical device companies in relation to the processing of personal data of EU data subjects. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or the United Kingdom, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. 
U.S. Healthcare Reform 
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our products. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical, medical device and biologics industries, among others. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future. For example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. While the Texas District Court Judge, as well as then-president Trump’s Administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. In December 2019, a U.S. District Court upheld a ruling that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. In November 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments in the appeal of this case. While the Supreme Court issued its ruling in July 2021, in part finding that the plaintiff’s lacked standing, it is unclear how this and other efforts to challenge, repeal, or replace the ACA, or how future changes in the Presidency, Congress or Senate, will impact the ACA or our business. 
There will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge and/or patients’ willingness to pay for our products. While in general it is too early to predict what effect, if any, any future healthcare reform legislation or policies will have on our business, current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. 
Pricing and Reimbursement 
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors. Third party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-
effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products, and efforts are underway to reduce the cost of medical products and services overall. We may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product or procedure using the product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate revenue levels. Future legislation could limit payments for our product candidates. 
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of less costly products. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our products. The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on medical product and service pricing. 
Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws 
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of pharmaceutical products and devices are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other federal, state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the FFDCA, Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended, the False Claims Act, as amended, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
As noted above, in the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a biological product manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or order of an item for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our sales and marketing practices and/or our relationships with physicians might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us. Because we plan to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we are subject. 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including pharmaceutical products, that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payers, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our 
products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,665 and $23,331 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. 
There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, referred to as the Sunshine Act, requires pharmaceutical product manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, registered nurses and teaching hospitals, among others, in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. 
Other Federal Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws 
We may also be subject to other federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including provisions of HIPAA, which prohibit knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, as well as knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. 
Human Capital
As of March 1, 2022, we had seven full-time employees, no part-time employees and three consultants. None of these employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Our talented employees are focused on driving our business with the foundation for all our efforts being the development of treatments to transform care for female cancers and improving the lives of women living with cancer. Our goal is that each colleague feels a deep connection to what they do, loves coming to work, and is aligned to our mission. 
Culture begins with our hiring process and continues throughout an employee’s time with Context. We support our colleagues with a comprehensive offering of competitive pay and benefits. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic began, we strive to ensure the safety of our colleagues and continue to adapt over time to the changing environment. 
Facilities 
Our principal office is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where we lease approximately 3,500 square feet of office space pursuant to a lease that expires in July 2023. We believe our facility is adequate to meet our current needs, although we may seek to negotiate new leases or evaluate additional or alternate space for our operations. We believe appropriate alternative space will be readily available on commercially reasonable terms.
Legal Proceedings 
From time to time we may be involved in disputes or litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
