ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Funko is a leading pop culture lifestyle brand. Our business is built on the belief that everyone is a fan of something, and Funko aims to have something for every fan. We create whimsical, fun and unique products that enable fans to express their affinity for their favorite “something”—whether it is a movie, TV show, video game, musician or sports team. We infuse our distinct designs and aesthetic sensibility into our extensive portfolio of licensed content over a wide variety of product categories, including figures, bags, wallets, apparel, accessories, board games, plush, homewares and digital non-fungible tokens ("NFTs"), which we make available at highly accessible price points. We believe we sit at the nexus of pop culture—content providers value us for our ability to connect fans to their properties with our creative products and broad distribution; retailers value us for our broad portfolio of licensed pop culture products that we can curate to resonate with their consumers; and consumers value us for our distinct, stylized products and the content they represent. We believe our innovative product design and market positioning have disrupted the licensed product markets and helped to define today’s pop culture products category.
The Pop Culture Industry
Pop culture encompasses virtually everything that someone can be a fan of—movies, TV shows, anime, video games, music, sports, books and more. Pop culture fandom has evolved from niche communities around specific properties to having a broad presence in modern life. Today, there is more quality content than ever before and technology innovation has made that content accessible anytime, anywhere. Social media has further allowed for fans to share their love and form communities more easily than before. Everyday interactions at home, work or with friends, whether in person or through social media, are increasingly influenced by pop culture.
The Forces at Work in The Pop Culture Industry
Technology Innovation
The proliferation of mobile technology, and the emergence of new content distribution services, such as Amazon Prime, AppleTV+, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Peacock and more have enabled fans to connect and engage with content anywhere, at any time, in larger “binge” quantities. An increasing array of content and greater accessibility have led to more fans spending more time per day consuming content. In addition, fans can develop a deeper affinity for content due to the increased prevalence of platforms and events where they can share their passion with other fans (such as through social media, blogs, YouTube, podcasts and online games). The accelerated pace of content discovery and sharing has created an environment where niche content can quickly become mainstream, resulting in more content becoming part of pop culture.
Evolution of Content
Content providers have increasingly focused on creating original scripted and franchise content that has broad global appeal and potential for sequels and brand extensions. Additionally, there has been an increase in high-quality scripted television series as content providers vie for binge worthy shows to attract consumers. For example, in 2021 there were 559 original scripted series in the U.S., a 13% increase over 2020, according to FX networks research. We expect content providers such as Amazon, Apple, Disney, Warner Bros., Hulu, Netflix and NBCUniversal to continue to invest in new high-quality original content. The proliferation and globalization across content types has fostered fan loyalty and stimulated licensed product purchases.

Dedicated and Active Fan Base
We believe pop culture fans possess distinguishing characteristics that make them highly valuable consumers. Like sports fans, fans of other forms of pop culture identify strongly with their favored properties, and have a natural tendency to form social communities around them. Furthermore, as it becomes increasingly easy to access a large quantity of quality content, fans seek more ways to expand and express connections to their favored characters or properties as they share their passion with others. As a result, consumers are participating in the story of these properties via social media platforms and conventions, such as Comic-Con, AnimeExpo and Star Wars Celebration, rather than being solely consumers of content. By being a part of the conversation regarding their favored content, fans reinforce their love for it, thereby creating a cycle of fandom.
Growing Cultural Relevance 
As pop culture engagement has increased, we believe fandom has become a pastime, and fans are more openly passionate about all forms of pop culture. Social media is driving the importance of pop culture as fans increasingly want to engage with the content across their social communities to show affinity for their favorite content. Three of the top U.S. pop culture-related conventions, including New York Comic Con, Comic Con International: San Diego and Anime Expo 2019, drew close to half a million attendees in 2019, representing a sharp increase of over 80% from 2010. This represents a cultural shift supporting the acceptability of fan affinity for pop culture content across all demographic categories of fans. In 2020 and 2021, due to COVID-19 impacts on in-person events, many pop-culture conventions such as Comic Con International: San Diego, New York Comic Con and others were cancelled or pivoted to virtual events, which continued to attract and engage fans in the new virtual format.
Our Strategic Differentiation
Deep and Extensive Licensing Partnerships
We have strong licensing relationships with many established content providers, such as Disney, Warner Bros., Marvel, LucasFilm, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Epic Games, Blizzard Entertainment, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and many more. We strive to partner with content providers across multiple genres, including movies, television, video games, anime, sports, and music. In 2021, we had license agreements with over 250 content providers covering over 1,000 licensed properties. We believe our numerous licensing relationships have allowed us to build one of the largest portfolios of licensed property in our industry, from which we can create multiple products based on each character within those properties. Content providers trust us to create unique extensions of their intellectual property that extend the relevance of their content with consumers through ongoing engagement, helping to maximize the lifetime value of their content. We believe we have benefited from a trend of content providers consolidating their relationships to do more business with fewer licensees. As a trusted steward with a strong retail distribution network and connection with the end user, we believe we have benefited from this trend. Further, we have historically been able to renew productive licenses on commercially reasonable terms, which positions us to benefit from the ongoing desire of consumers to engage with and show affinity for their favorite pop culture content. 
Diverse Range of Properties
We strive to license every pop culture property that we believe is relevant to our consumers. Over the last decade, we have built strong relationships with content providers and currently have a catalog of licenses covering hundreds of properties that we believe is one of the industry’s largest. Our licensed property portfolio encompasses a diverse range of genres to ensure our products have broad consumer appeal. Many of our licensed properties are "evergreen" in nature—properties that are not tied to a current or new content release, such as Mickey Mouse, Harry Potter or classic Batman. We have visibility into the new release schedule of our content providers and our expansive license portfolio allows us to dynamically manage new product creation. This allows us to adjust the mix of products based on evergreen properties and new releases, depending on the media release cycle. As a result, we can manage our business to capitalize on pop culture trends, which has allowed us to lessen our dependence on individual content releases. This allows our business to be diversified across properties, as well as evergreen and current content. 
Table of Contents

For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, no single property accounted for more than 7% of our sales, and the portion of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 attributable to our top five properties was 20%, 22% and 23%, respectively. Additionally, the portion of our sales related to evergreen properties for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was approximately 67%, 66% and 51%, respectively.
Broad Portfolio of Products and Brands
We create products to attract a broad array of fans across consumer demographic groups. We believe our broad appeal comes from our large selection of licenses and properties that we apply across a variety of product categories and brands. We do not limit ourselves by targeting discrete demographics such as only collectors or children seeking the latest (and often short-lived) toy craze. We strive to have something for everyone by offering figures and other product categories including bags, wallets, apparel, board games, plush, accessories, homewares and more. We expect to continue to look for ways to diversify our product offerings to reach an even broader group of consumers. 
In addition to offering multiple properties and product categories, we create and sell a variety of unique brands that have their own look and feel. Our brand portfolio includes Pop! and Loungefly as well as others such as Funko, Mystery Mini, Paka Paka, Vinyl Gold and Popsies. Pop! is our largest and most recognized brand that encompasses multiple product categories, including figures, accessories, apparel, games, bags and more. The portion of sales attributed to Pop! branded products in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 74%, 76% and 79%, respectively. Loungefly branded products include stylized fashion accessories such as bags, wallets and backpacks as well as apparel. The portion of sales attributed to Loungefly branded products in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 14%, 13% and 9%, respectively. Additionally, from time-to-time our in-house creative team creates new brands and products based on Funko’s own intellectual property and non-licensed board games. 
Broad Consumer Appeal and Engagement
Fans are increasingly looking for ways to express their affinity for and engage with their favorite pop culture content. Over time, many of our consumers evolve from occasional buyers to more frequent purchasers, whom we categorize as enthusiasts or collectors. We estimate that enthusiasts, who are more engaged in pop culture, and collectors, who regularly purchase our products and self-identify as collectors, each make up approximately one-third of our consumers. We create products to appeal to a broad array of fans across consumer demographic groups. We strive to keep our products at an accessible price point, generally under $12 for our figure category, which allows our fans to express their fandom frequently and impulsively. We continue to introduce innovative products designed to facilitate fan engagement across different price points and categories. Our fans routinely express their passion for our products and brands through social media and live pop culture events, such as Comic-Con or Star Wars Celebration. Additionally, we seek to drive direct engagement with our fans through in person experiences at our flagship retail stores and fan events, as well as digitally through our websites, mobile application and various social media platforms. In 2020, given the impact of COVID-19 on in-person events, we began conducting virtual events including multiple Funko Virtual Con events, to continue to drive engagement with fans. We continued this throughout 2021 with a few hybrid events (both in person and virtual) where we could safely do so. We believe we have one of the largest and most engaged fan bases in our industry, driven by their passion and love of our unique products and the properties we represent.

Diversified Global Distribution Network
We sell our products through a diverse network of retail customers across multiple retail channels, including specialty retailers, mass-market retailers, and e-commerce sites, as well as directly to consumers primarily through our owned websites and two flagship retail stores. We can provide our retail customers a customized product mix designed to appeal to their consumer bases. Our key retail partners in the United States include Amazon, GameStop, Hot Topic, Target and Walmart. Internationally, we sell our products directly to similar retailers, primarily in Europe, through our subsidiary Funko UK, Ltd. Our key international retail customers include Amazon, GameStop, Fnac and Tesco. We believe some of our retail customers, such as Target and Walmart, view us as pop culture experts, and we help them manage their pop culture category. We believe we drive meaningful traffic to our retail customers’ stores because our products have their own built-in fan base, are refreshed regularly creating a “treasure hunt” shopping experience for consumers, and are often supplemented with exclusive, limited-time products that are highlighted on social media. We believe these merchandising strategies create a sense of urgency with consumers that encourages repeat visits to our retail customers. 
Additionally, we are continuing to invest in our direct-to-consumer channel to expand our reach and further strengthen our relationship with our fan base. Our direct-to-consumer channel includes our own e-commerce websites in the U.S. and Europe as well as our two flagship retail stores located in the U.S. 
Nimble Speed to Market Reflects “Fast Fashion” Product Development Process
Speed to market has become increasingly important as technological innovation has accelerated the pace of content discovery and sharing and the speed at which niche content can become mainstream. We have developed a nimble and low fixed-cost production model built on the strength of our in-house creative team as well as our relationships with content providers, retailers and third-party manufacturers. Our production model enables us to go from product design of a figure to the store shelf within 110 to 200 days and we can typically have it shipped from the factory in as few as 70 days, with a minimal upfront investment for most figures of $5,000 to $7,500 in tooling, molds and internal design costs. During 2021, we saw, and in 2022, we continue to see some delays with the global capacity constraints and the availability of shipping containers, but we have employed mitigation strategies to get product in the hands of our customer base as soon as feasible. Because of the strength of our in-house creative team, we are able to move from product design to pre-selling certain new products in as few as 24 hours. As a result, we can dynamically manage our business to balance current content releases and pop culture trends with content based on classic evergreen properties. 
Leading Design and Creative Capabilities
Our in-house creative team layers our own whimsical, fun and distinct stylization onto content providers’ characters, creating unique products for which there is substantial consumer demand. We believe content providers trust us with their properties, and consumers passionately engage with our products and brands because of our creativity. In addition, our creativity and designs allow us to reinvigorate classic evergreen content by infusing a fresh, unique aesthetic into characters that enjoy enduring passion and nostalgia from fans. With the help of our in-house creative team, we have also begun to develop our own proprietary intellectual property as well as various non-licensed board games. As a result of our creative capabilities and broad portfolio of licenses, we create a substantial number of new products each year.
Growth Strategies
Grow our Core Pop Culture Business
We intend to grow our core business by utilizing our strength in building fun, creative and nostalgic programs at retail through: (1) leveraging an increasing array of content, categories and distribution; (2) creating programs that utilize evergreen content with a focus on targeting underpenetrated content genres to expand our addressable market; and (3) continued product innovation to bring new designs and products to market. 
We also intend to continue licensing content that will allow us to capitalize on the popularity of current releases across movies, TV shows, video games, and other content types, and to leverage those licenses across a broader array of products and expanded distribution to reach new consumers.
Table of Contents

We have the ability to leverage evergreen or back catalog content by creating fun, whimsical and nostalgic programs to be sold at retail that resonate with fans. Our evergreen programs include new versions of well-known characters such as our Marvel Venomized line or, products built around nostalgic content or places such as Disney theme parks.
Additionally, we intend to strategically focus on growing within genres that we believe we have underpenetrated, such as anime, sports and music. We expect to do this by expanding our license portfolio, creating new products or designs that resonate with fans and strategically expanding our distribution of these products. Within anime, we continue to add new license relationships with multiple new properties. For example, in 2018 we recorded approximately $29.4 million in sales over 32 properties and in 2021 we recorded approximately $81.4 million in sales over 48 properties. In the sports category, we are continuing to leverage our broad range of sports licenses, which includes the NFL, NBA, NHL, WWE, English Premier League, MLB and more. In 2021, we launched Funko Gold, which is initially focused on sports and music figures in a head-to-toe stylized look. Additionally, within the music category, we are expanding our license base to include more artists for Pop! Albums, a product line introduced in 2020 under the Pop! brand that seeks to appeal to music fans by recreating iconic covers of music albums. 
We expect to continue to utilize our in-house creative team to create new designs, products and brands that resonate with our core consumers. For example, in 2019 we launched Funko Vinyl Soda, a stylized collectible vinyl figure to that comes with the opportunity to be surprised by a rare chase piece.
Diversify our Revenue Streams through Product Innovation
We are leveraging Funko’s pop culture platform to diversify our revenue streams across product categories, channels and geographies. In addition to designing products to address both new and evergreen content, we have introduced new toy lines, board games and softlines to leverage our existing retail partnerships and open up potential new channels of distribution. In 2020, we added new non-licensed toy lines such as Snapsies and launched dozens of new offerings under our Funko Games brand, including Funkoverse branded games, and many other licensed games and non-licensed games. We also continually evaluate product innovations and potential acquisition targets to complement our existing product categories, lines and brands. For example, in 2017, we completed the acquisition of Loungefly, LLC (“Loungefly”), a designer of a variety of licensed pop culture fashion handbags, small leather goods and accessories, to expand and diversify our product offerings in our accessories category (the “Loungefly Acquisition”). In 2019, we acquired Forrest-Pruzan Creative LLC, a leading board game development studio, to help us expand our product offerings into the board game category and to develop the Funko Games brand. In 2021, we launched, through our acquisition of the majority interest in TokenWave, LLC, the Company's first NFTs. These exclusive digital card packs are currently sold on the WAX blockchain platform and have often sold out in a matter of minutes, with residual buyers still waiting in the queue.
Extend Funko’s International Reach
We believe the rise of pop culture and deep fan loyalty are global. We believe our sales are currently underpenetrated internationally as we generate the majority of our net sales in the United States. Sales generated from customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 28%, 25% and 34% of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are continuing to invest in the growth of our international business, primarily in Europe, both directly and through third party distributors. In 2020, we launched our own e-commerce website in Europe, www.funkoeurope.com, which initially served the U.K., Ireland, Spain, Germany, France and Italy, and has since expanded into six additional countries throughout Europe. We believe there are opportunities to further grow our sales in other regions, such as Latin America, Canada, Oceania and APAC, by expanding our direct sales to retailers or through distributor relationships.
Table of Contents

Increase our Direct-to-Consumer Business
We view our direct-to-consumer business, which includes our e-commerce websites, www.funko.com, www.funkoeurope.com and www.loungefly.com, and two flagship retail stores, as a significant growth opportunity and an important vehicle for expanding our reach and broadening our relationship with our fans. We plan to build a robust online platform and to enhance our digital capabilities to provide the infrastructure to scale this business over the long-term. In 2020, we relaunched www.funko.com with an expanded product offering, and enhanced features and functionality to serve our customers in the U.S., and also launched www.funkoeurope.com to serve our customers in the UK and several countries in Europe. Our direct-to-consumer strategy also provides us with an opportunity to utilize data and trend analysis to inform our overall business strategy. We believe our direct-to-consumer business will help us strengthen our connection with our fans, deepen consumer engagement to drive customer lifetime value, build brand awareness with new audience segments, and support our retail customers.
Product Lines and Licenses
We sell a broad array of licensed pop culture consumer products featuring characters from an extensive range of media and entertainment content, including movies, TV shows, video games, music and sports. Our products combine our proprietary brands and distinct designs and aesthetic sensibilities into properties we license from content providers. We seek to license content that will allow us to capitalize on the popularity of current movies, TV shows, video games, music and other content releases, as well as classic evergreen properties, which are not tied to a current or new release, and which are less subject to pop culture trends. Additionally, by utilizing our in-house creative team we have the ability to develop our own content and intellectual property as well as various board game offerings.
Our Products
Our current products principally fall within the following product categories:
Figures. Our figures category includes figures that celebrate pop culture icons in the form of stylized vinyl, blind-packed miniatures and action figures. These figures combine the pop culture properties we license with our own distinctive designs to create pop culture figures that appeal to a broad range of consumers at an affordable price point, often under one of our proprietary brands, such as Pop!, Mystery Minis, and Funko Soda. Additionally, from time to time we will create figures that are not licensed such as our Paka Paka brand. 
Other. Our other category is comprised of stylized fashion accessories (including bags, backpacks and wallets); apparel; board games; plush products; accessories (including keychains, pens and pins); apparel (including t-shirts and hats); homewares (including drinkware and other home accessories); NFTs and other.
Our Brands and Designs
Under the Funko brand, we have multiple proprietary brands under which most of our products are marketed. Currently, our principal proprietary brands include Pop! and Loungefly. 
Pop!, introduced in 2010, is our most well-recognized brand. The Pop! stylized design incorporates a rounded square head that typically consists of no mouth and a very simple nose. Our standard Pop! Vinyl figure stands about four inches tall. The Pop! brand has also been applied across many of our other product categories, including games, plush, accessories, apparel and homewares. Pop! branded products represented 74%, 76% and 79% of our sales in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Our Loungefly branded products are generally fashion accessories including stylized handbags, backpacks, wallets, clothing, and other accessories. Loungefly branded products represented 14%, 13% and 9% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Other brands we market under include Mystery Minis, Paka Paka, and Popsies. In addition, we also develop product lines that we market under the broader Funko brand, such as Funko Games, Funko action figures, Funko Soda, Funko Plush, and Funko Gold product lines. We expect to continue to develop new product designs and lines, which may develop into proprietary brands in the future.

Our Licenses
Licensors. We have strong licensing relationships with many established content providers, such as Disney, HBO, LucasFilm, Marvel, Netflix, Pokémon, the National Football League, NBCUniversal, Epic Games, Blizzard Entertainment and Warner Bros. We seek to establish new licensing relationships with content providers in order to capitalize on new and emerging trends in pop culture. We believe we also provide value to content providers by maximizing the lifetime value of their content by extending its relevance to consumers through ongoing fan engagement.
License Agreements. Our license agreements permit us to use the intellectual property of our licensors in connection with the products we design and sell. These license agreements typically provide that our licensors own intellectual property rights in the products we design and sell under the license, and as a result, upon termination of the license, we no longer have the right to sell these products. A number of these license agreements relate to properties that are significant to our business and operations. Our license agreements typically have terms of between two and three years and are not automatically renewable. However, we believe we have strong relationships with our licensors, and have historically been able to renew productive licenses on commercially reasonable terms.
Our license agreements require us to make royalty payments to the licensor based on our sales of the licensed product and, in some cases, require us to incur other charges. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the average royalty rate was 15.7%, 16.1% and 15.9%, respectively. Our royalty expense for any given year will vary depending on the mix of products and properties sold during that year. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred royalty expenses of $162.0 million, $105.0 million and $126.8, respectively. Our licenses are generally not exclusive. In addition, the rights that licensors grant to us are typically limited to specific properties, product categories, territories and, in some cases, sales channels. 
In addition, our license agreements usually require us to obtain the licensor’s approval of products we develop under the license prior to making any sales. They also typically provide for a minimum guarantee that covers all licensed properties under that license agreement, a portion of which is generally required to be paid in advance, and the amount of which is negotiated based on a variety of factors, including past and expected sales and the licensor’s expected line-up of new releases. Historically, we have a strong track record for meeting minimum guarantees under our license agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded reserves of $0.7 million, $1.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively, related to prepaid royalties we estimated would not be recovered through sales. 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, 26% of sales were related to the Company’s two largest license agreements (13% each) with no other license agreements accounting for more than 10% of sales. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 12% and 11% of sales were related to the Company’s two largest license agreements with no other license agreements accounting for more than 10% of sales. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 13%, 11% and 11% of sales were related to the Company’s three largest license agreements with no other license agreements accounting for more than 10% of sales.
Licensed Properties. We strive to license every pop culture property that we believe is relevant to consumers. What we consider to be a property will vary based on the terms of the underlying license agreement. In general, we consider each content title to constitute a single property. In some instances, however, a property may consist of an entire franchise or even a single character, particularly in our classic evergreen category. We primarily divide our licensed properties between classic evergreen and current or new releases. We also license certain properties that fall outside of these main categories.
•Classic Evergreen. Properties in the classic evergreen category are based on movies, TV shows, video games, music, sports or other entertainment content that is not tied to a new or current release at the time we release the product. As a result, products that we design and sell based on these properties generally do not have a defined duration of market demand. Examples of our classic evergreen properties include Star Wars Classic, Harry Potter, DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Pokémon and WWE.
Table of Contents

•Current Releases. Properties in the current release category typically are tied to new movie releases, current television series or new video game titles. These properties are intended to capitalize on the excitement of fans surrounding the launch of new content. Products that we design and sell based on new movie releases are expected to have a limited duration of market demand, depending on the popularity of the title. Examples of new movie releases are Spider-Man: No Way Home, Avengers Endgame, Space Jam 2. Additionally, products that we design and sell based on current television series or new video game titles are expected to have a market demand depending on the popularity and longevity of the title, which is generally expected to be multiple years. Examples of our current TV and video game properties include The Mandalorian, Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, My Hero Academia, Avatar: The Last Airbender. Examples of our current video game properties are Fortnite, Overwatch and Five Nights at Freddy’s.
We expect these categories and the properties they encompass to evolve over time as current content becomes classic evergreen and as new forms of pop culture content emerge. The percent of our sales attributable to classic evergreen and current releases may fluctuate in any given year based on the number and popularity of new content releases. 
Product Design and Development
We believe our creative product designs and nimble speed to market are key reasons why content providers trust us with their properties and consumers passionately engage with our brands and products. We leverage our creative, art and sculpting teams to design and develop products in-house from inception to production. Our creative team layers our whimsical, fun and unique style onto the content we license to create product designs that resonate with consumers. Additionally, from time to time our creative team will develop new styles and products based on our own intellectual property. Our creative team is passionate about pop culture, and we believe we have a strong pipeline of talent given our culture and the opportunity we provide to work with the most relevant pop culture content. Our designers often work collaboratively with content providers in advance of new content releases to create unique, stylized products (both physical and digital) to maximize the value of their properties.
Our product development team oversees all aspects of new product development in order to ensure a timely product design and development process, including submitting the initial design to the content provider for approval, developing the product prototype, receiving final content provider approval and coordinating manufacturing with our supply chain team and third-party manufacturers. Our flexible and low-fixed cost production model enables us to move from product design of a figure to shipping from the factory in as few as 70 days and to the store shelf typically between 110 and 200 days, with a minimal upfront investment for most figures of $5,000 to $7,500 in tooling, molds and internal design costs. During 2021 we saw, and in 2022, we have seen some delays with the global capacity constraints and the availability of shipping containers, but employed mitigation strategies to get product in the hands of our customer base as soon as feasible. Because of the strength of our in-house creative team, we are able to move from product design to pre-selling a new product in as few as 24 hours. We believe that this ability, coupled with the valuable data insights we have developed over the past decade and the increasing use of repeated franchise properties by content providers, reduces potential product risk to us.
Manufacturing and Materials
Our products are produced by third-party manufacturers primarily in Vietnam and China, which we choose on the basis of performance, capacity, capability and price. We also manufacture or assemble certain apparel and other products in the United States, Mexico and Cambodia. The use of third-party manufacturers enables us to avoid incurring fixed manufacturing costs, while maximizing flexibility, capacity and capability. Though our manufacturing base has diversified over time as we have grown our sales and expanded our product offerings, we have historically concentrated production with a small number of manufacturers and factories as part of a continuing effort to monitor quality, reduce manufacturing costs and ensure speed to market. In the case of most of the factories in which our products are manufactured, our products represent a significant percentage of each factory’s total capacity, which we believe provides us greater flexibility in supply chain management. We do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers. We believe that alternative sources of supply are available to us although we cannot be assured that we can obtain adequate supplies of manufactured products on a timely basis or at all.
Table of Contents

We base our production schedules for products on our internal forecasts, taking into account historical trends of similar products and properties, current market information and communications with customers. The accuracy of our forecasts is affected by consumer acceptance of our products, which is typically based on the strength and popularity of the underlying licensed property, the strength of competing products, the marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both our retail customers and our consumers, and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in a lack of product availability or excess inventory of a particular product.
Although we do not conduct the day-to-day manufacturing of our products, we are responsible for designing both the product and the packaging. We seek to ensure quality control by actively reviewing the product, both in-house and via image at multiple stages in development and sample finished goods to validate the quality control process. In addition to quality control testing, safety testing of our products is done by independent third-party testing laboratories.
While we purchase finished products from our manufacturers, the cost of our products is impacted by the cost of labor, as well as the cost, timing and/or availability of the principal raw materials used in the production and sale of our products, including vinyl, fabric, ceramics and plastics. All of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price or delays in shipping to the factories as a result of global capacity constraints. Although we do not manufacture our products, we own most of the tools and molds used in the manufacturing process, and generally these are transferable among manufacturers if we choose to employ alternative manufacturers.
Sales
We sell our products to a diverse network of customers throughout the world as well as directly to our consumers primarily through our own websites and two flagship retail stores. Domestically, we sell our products to specialty retailers, mass-market retailers and e-commerce sites. Our key retail partners in the United States include Amazon, GameStop, Hot Topic, Target and Walmart. Internationally, we sell our products directly to similar retailers, primarily in Europe, through our subsidiary Funko UK, Ltd. Our key international retail customers include Amazon, GameStop, Fnac and Tesco. In addition to major retailers, we also sell our products to distributors for sale to small retailers in the United States and in certain countries internationally, typically where we do not currently have a direct presence. 
We also sell our products directly to consumers through our e-commerce business, two flagship retail stores and, to a lesser extent, at specialty licensing and comic book shows, conventions and exhibitions in cities throughout the United States including at Comic-Con events. Our direct-to-consumer sales accounted for approximately 11%, 8% and 4% of our sales for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Though our direct-to-consumer efforts have historically represented a small portion of our net sales, we intend to increase our focus on these efforts in the future. In 2020, we relaunched www.funko.com with an expanded product offering, and enhanced features and functionality, to serve our customers in the U.S., and we also launched www.funkoeurope.com to serve customers in the UK and several countries in Europe.
We believe we have a diverse customer base, with our top ten customers representing approximately 45%, 48% and 44%, of our 2021, 2020, and 2019 sales, respectively. No single customer accounted for over 10% of revenues during these periods.
We maintain a full-time sales staff, many of whom make on-site visits to our customers for the purpose of showing products and soliciting orders. Many of our retail customers view us as experts in pop culture and, in some cases, we help manage their growing pop culture category within their stores, providing a curated experience by catering to their particular customer bases. We believe this creates a mutually beneficial relationship between us and our retail customers by providing us with an opportunity to enhance the productivity of the pop culture category within their stores, which may also result in expanded shelf space for our products. In addition to our full-time sales staff, we also retain several independent sales representatives to sell and promote our products both domestically and internationally.

We sell our products to our customers with payment terms typically varying from 30 to 90 days. We contract the manufacture of most of our products to third-party unaffiliated manufacturers primarily located in Vietnam, China and Mexico and ship those products to our warehouse or third-party logistics facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. While most of our sales originate in the United States and the United Kingdom from inventory we hold in our warehouses and third-party logistics locations, certain of our customers may take title to our products upon shipment from the factory or at the port.
We establish reserves for sales allowances, including promotional and other allowances, at the time of sale. The reserves are determined as a percentage of sales based upon either historical experience or upon estimates or programs agreed upon by our customers and us. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had reserves for sales allowances of $40.6 million and $28.0 million, respectively.
Marketing
We believe Funko’s trendsetting and nostalgia-based product assortment is a unique voice in the pop culture marketplace, and that our expansive retailer presence, high engagement rates across our owned channels, and devout fan base create fervor for the Funko brand. Our ability to effectively engage with our customers has resulted in a deep affinity for Funko and our products.
Funko continues to acquire new fans through high profile social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. As of December 31, 2021, Funko’s Twitter handle, @OriginalFunko, had over one million followers. We continue to expand our reach globally through our compelling content, events and personal engagement with our fan base. For example, in 2019 we opened a 40,000-square foot retail-tainment experience on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California to further increase our brand presence and create additional opportunities to engage with our fan base. We also plan to develop and implement new marketing programs aimed at driving traffic to our websites and new customer acquisition targeted to specific products and properties.
Competition
We are a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of licensed pop culture and other products, in a highly competitive industry. We compete with toy, board game and fashion accessory companies across our product categories, some of which have substantially more resources, stronger name recognition, and longer operating histories than us, and which benefit from greater economies of scale. We also increasingly compete with large toy and board game companies for shelf space at leading mass market and other retailers. We also compete with numerous smaller domestic and foreign collectible toy, board game and fashion accessory designers and manufacturers across our product categories. Our competitive advantage is based primarily on the creativity and quality of the design of our products, our price points, our broad consumer appeal, our license portfolio and our ability to bring new products to market quickly.
We produce most of our products under trademarks and copyrights that we own, utilizing the intellectual property of our licensors. Certain of our licensors have reserved the rights to manufacture, distribute and sell similar or identical products. Some of these products could directly compete with our products and could be sold to our customers or directly to consumers at lower prices than those at which our products are sold.
Although we believe we have one of the largest portfolios of licensed content in the pop culture industry, with strong relationships with many of our licensors, we must vigorously compete to obtain these licenses from leading content providers on commercially reasonable terms, and to expand our license rights into additional licensed product categories. This competition is based primarily on the creativity of our product designs, our ability to bring new products to market quickly, our ability to increase fan engagement, the breadth of our sales channels and the quality of our products. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”

Intellectual Property
We believe that our trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to the marketing of our brand and the favorable perception of our products. We track our trademark registrations to ensure that marks used in commerce are renewed and maintained to prevent expiration of trademark rights. As of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 101 registered U.S. trademarks, 247 registered international trademarks, 29 pending U.S. trademark applications and 16 pending international trademark applications. Most of our products are produced and sold under trademarks owned by or licensed to us. We register many of our trademarks related to our brands and seek protection under the trademark and copyright laws of the United States and other countries where our products are produced or sold. These intellectual property rights can be significant assets. Accordingly, while we believe we are sufficiently protected, the failure to obtain or the loss of some of these rights could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Government Regulation
Our products sold in the United States are subject to the provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act (“CPSA”), the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (“FHSA”), the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (“CPSIA”) and the Flammable Fabrics Act (“FFA”), and the regulations promulgated pursuant to such statutes. These statutes and the related regulations ban from the market any consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety laws, regulations, and standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may require the recall, repurchase, replacement, or repair of any such banned products or products that otherwise create a substantial risk of injury and may seek penalties for regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances. Similar laws exist in some U.S. states and our products sold worldwide are subject to the provisions of similar laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia, Europe and Asia.
We maintain a quality control program to help ensure compliance with applicable product safety requirements. We use independent third-party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the CPSA, the FHSA, the CPSIA, the FFA, other applicable domestic and international product standards, as well as our own standards and those of some of our larger retail customers and licensors. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free, and we may in the future experience issues in products that result in recalls, withdrawals, or replacements of products. A product recall could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, depending on the product affected by the recall and the extent of the recall efforts required. A product recall could also negatively affect our reputation and the sales of other Funko products. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
In relation to our sales and marketing activities, we are subject to various consumer protection rules and regulations promulgated and/or enforced by various federal and state regulators such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general as well as non-U.S. regulatory authorities that relate to advertising, product delivery and other consumer-facing practices. In addition, our online products and services, including our e-commerce and digital communications activities, are or may be subject to U.S. and non-U.S. data privacy and cybersecurity laws, such as the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, the California Consumer Privacy Protection Act (“CCPA”), and the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
We are subject to various other federal, state, local and international laws and regulations applicable to our business, including export controls, and have established processes for compliance with these laws and regulations.
Human Capital
Our workforce is critical to our success. We seek out employees who are passionate about pop culture, our products and our business, and who can help us build strong relationships with our partners, customers, fans and local communities. Pop culture changes constantly, and we look to build teams that are nimble and can execute in our fast-paced environment. We strive to foster a sense of community with our employees and make the workplace fun despite the demands of our rapidly changing business. We believe our passion for pop culture of all forms is reflected in our fans around the world. We believe that fully serving those fans requires a diverse and inclusive workforce. We have implemented programs to advance these principles and embrace the opportunity to work with people of diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

In addition to offering market competitive salaries and wages, we offer comprehensive health and 401(k) benefits to eligible employees. Our core benefits packages are supplemented with specific programs centered around voluntary benefits, paid time away from work and employee physical and mental well-being. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes adopting remote work policies for our corporate employees as appropriate, while also implementing significant safety measures designed to protect the health of all those working at or entering our distribution centers, retail outlets and other facilities that have remained open during the pandemic.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 1,089 full-time employees. We employed 902 people in North America, 172 people in Europe and 15 people in Asia. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
Seasonality
While our customers in the retail industry, and many of our competitors, typically operate in highly seasonal businesses, we have historically experienced only moderate seasonality in our business. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 approximately 59%, 64% and 55%, respectively, of our net sales were made in the third and fourth quarters, as our customers build up their inventories in anticipation of the holiday season. The revenue distribution for the year ended December 31, 2020 was in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than typical seasonality, as we experienced weakened demand for our products in the first half of the year ended December 31, 2020, which had a negative impact on our net sales for the same period.
Generally, the first quarter of the year represents the lowest volume of shipments and sales in our business and in the retail and toy industries generally, and it is also the least profitable quarter due to the various fixed costs of the business. However, the rapid growth we have experienced in recent years may have masked the full effects of seasonal factors on our business to date, and as such, seasonality may have a greater effect on our results of operations in future periods. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
