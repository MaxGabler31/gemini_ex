Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company using our proprietary chemistry technology to create, develop and commercialize novel tetracyclines for serious and life-threatening conditions, including bacterial infections caused by multidrug-resistant, or MDR, bacteria. There is a medical need for new antibiotics as resistance to existing antibiotics increases. In recognition of this need, we developed our product, XeravaTM (eravacycline), a fully synthetic fluorocycline, as an intravenous, or IV antibiotic for use as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of MDR infections, including MDR Gram-negative infections, such as those found in complicated intra-abdominal infections, or cIAI.  
 On August 27, 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved Xerava for the treatment of cIAI in adults. Approval of Xerava was based on our IGNITE (Investigating Gram-Negative Infections Treated with Eravacycline) phase 3 program. In the first pivotal phase 3 trial in the IGNITE program in patients with cIAI, twice-daily IV Xerava met the primary endpoint by demonstrating statistical non-inferiority of clinical response compared to ertapenem, a carbapenem and a standard of care treatment for cIAI, and was well-tolerated. We refer to this trial as IGNITE1. In our other pivotal phase 3 clinical trial of Xerava in patients with cIAI, twice-daily IV Xerava met the primary endpoint by demonstrating statistical non-inferiority of clinical response compared to meropenem, another standard of care treatment, and was well-tolerated. We refer to this trial as IGNITE4. In both IGNITE1 and IGNITE4, Xerava achieved high cure rates in patients with poly-microbial infections (Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and anaerobic infections), including resistant isolates.
In October 2018, we commenced sales of Xerava in the United States. We are commercializing Xerava in the United States using a small, targeted commercial and medical affairs groups to build and promote access to Xerava. As a result, as of March 1, 2019, we have approximately 40 sales representatives in the field, three strategic market access executives and approximately 10 medical affairs personnel supporting Xerava in the United States. 
 On September 20, 2018, based on the results of IGNITE1, the European Commission, or EC, granted marketing authorization for Xerava for the treatment of cIAI in adults in all 28 countries of the European Union, or EU, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. In February 2018 we entered into a license agreement with Everest Medicines Limited, or Everest Medicines, granting Everest Medicines commercialization rights to eravacycline in China and other Asian territories. In June 2018, Everest Medicines submitted an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the China National Medical Products Administration (formerly China FDA) for a phase 3 clinical trial of eravacycline in cIAI. The application was approved, and Everest Medicines expects to begin enrolling patients in this phase 3 trial in the second quarter of 2019.
 Subject to obtaining additional financing, we intend to pursue development of Xerava for the treatment of additional indications, including other serious and life-threatening infections. We may pursue these development activities either by ourselves or with collaborators.
 We believe that the ability of Xerava to cover MDR Gram-negative bacteria, as well as MDR Gram-positive, anaerobic and atypical bacteria, may enable Xerava to become the drug of choice for first-line empiric treatment of patients with cIAI. In in vitro studies, Xerava has demonstrated the ability to cover a wide variety of MDR Gram-negative, Gram-positive, anaerobic and atypical bacteria, including multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and MDR Acinetobacter. Multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (or CREs) listed as an urgent threat and MDR Acinetobacter is listed as a serious threat by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, in a September 2013 report. They are also listed as “Priority 1; Critical Pathogens” in the World Health Organization’s priority pathogens list for R&D, published in February 2017. CREs were a confirmed area of great concern by the World Health Organization in an April 2014 global surveillance report. Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to multiple available existing antibiotics are increasingly common and a growing threat to public health.

In addition to Xerava we are also developing other fluorocycline antibiotic compounds, TP-6076 and TP-271, and TP-2846, a tetracycline for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. We are developing TP-6076, a fully-synthetic fluorocycline derivative, as a lead candidate under our second-generation program to target unmet medical needs, including MDR Gram-negative bacteria such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii. To date, we have conducted phase 1 single- and multiple-ascending dose studies evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IV TP-6076 in healthy volunteers. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 study to assess the bronchopulmonary disposition, pharmacokinetics, and safety of TP-6076 in healthy volunteers. TP-271 is a fully-synthetic fluorocycline that we are developing for respiratory disease caused by bacterial biothreat and antibiotic-resistant public health pathogens, as well as bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. To date, we have completed single- and multiple-ascending dose trials for IV and oral formulations of TP-271. We expect to report results of these studies at a future scientific meeting. In February 2017, we received Qualified Infectious Disease Product and Fast Track designations from the FDA for TP-271. To continue the development of TP-271 we are looking to secure additional non-dilutive funding. We are also developing TP-2846, a fully-synthetic tetracycline discovered in-house, for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. We have recently initiated pre-clinical toxicology studies for this compound and will present preclinical data at the 2019 American Association for Cancer Research conference.  
In 2011 and 2012, the United States government awarded contracts for potential funding of over $100 million for the development of our antibiotic compounds, Xerava, TP-6076 and TP-271. These awards include a contract for up to $67.3 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for the development of Xerava for the treatment of disease caused by bacterial biothreat pathogens. We refer to this contract as the BARDA Contract. These awards also include a contract for up to $35.8 million from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, a division of the National Institutes of Health, for the development of TP-271. We refer to this contract as the NIAID Contract. In addition, during 2011, NIAID awarded a separate grant for $2.9 million. We refer to this award as the NIAID Grant. These awards were made to CUBRC, Inc., or CUBRC, an independent, not-for-profit, research corporation that specializes in U.S. government-based contracts, with which we are collaborating. CUBRC serves as the prime contractor under these awards, primarily carrying out a program management and administrative role with additional responsibility for the management of preclinical studies. We served as lead technical expert on all aspects of these awards and also served as a subcontractor of CUBRC responsible for management of chemistry, manufacturing and control activities and clinical studies.
 In March 2017, the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator, or CARB-X, an international public-private partnership focused on advancing new antimicrobial products to address the threat of antibiotic resistance, selected us to receive up to $4.0 million in research funding over 18 months for TP-6076. In connection with this funding, we entered into a cost reimbursement Sub-Award Agreement with the T
rustees of Boston University, the administrator of the program. We began recognizing revenue from the Sub-Award Agreement in April 2017. Although the Sub-Award Agreement expired by its terms on December 31, 2018, we expect to reach an agreement with CARB-X to extend the performance date out to June 30, 2019. The project can be terminated for convenience at any time.   
 Drug-Resistant Antibiotic Market
 Physicians commonly prescribe antibiotics to treat patients with acute and chronic infectious diseases that are either presumed or known to be caused by bacteria. Inappropriate use of antibiotics and lack of new therapies has resulted in a rapid increase in bacterial infections that are resistant to multiple antibacterial agents. Global microbial resistance, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, now results in the death of at least 700,000 people each year, according to The Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, an analysis commissioned by the U.K. government in 2016. The report predicts that failing to develop effective treatments for drug-resistant bacteria by 2050 would lead to 10 million extra deaths a year. Further, in a September 2013 report, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, estimated that every year in the United States, more than two million people acquire serious infections that are resistant to one or more of the antibiotics designed to treat those infections, with at least 23,000 dying as a result, and many more dying from other conditions that are complicated by the occurrence of an antibiotic-resistant infection. These antibiotic-resistant infections add considerable and avoidable costs to the United States healthcare system. In the same September 2013 report, the CDC noted that the total economic cost of antibiotic-resistant infections to the United States economy has been estimated to be as high as $20 billion in excess direct healthcare costs. Over the last decade there has been an increase in antibiotics that target resistant Gram-positive bacteria, but there still remain limited therapeutic options for resistant Gram-negative infections. According to the CDC, among all of the bacterial resistance problems, Gram-negative pathogens are particularly worrisome because they are becoming resistant to nearly all drugs that would be considered for treatment, with the most serious Gram-negative infections being healthcare associated and the most common pathogens being Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter.
 3


Antibiotics that treat bacterial infections can be classified as broad-spectrum or narrow-spectrum. Antibiotics that are active against a mixture of Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria are referred to as broad-spectrum. Antibiotics that are active only against a select subset of bacteria are referred to as narrow-spectrum. Because it usually takes from 24 to 72 hours from the time a specimen is received in the laboratory to definitively diagnose a particular bacterial infection, physicians may be required to prescribe antibiotics for serious infections without having identified the bacteria. As such, effective first-line treatment of serious infections, commonly referred to as empiric treatment, requires the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against a broad range of bacteria at least until the bacterial infection can be diagnosed. 
 Broad-spectrum antibiotics are used to treat major hospital infections such as cIAI. Based on an analysis from a variety of industry sources, we estimate that the number of patients treated with antibiotics in the United States and European Union annually includes approximately 4.6 million cIAI patients with each patient being treated for an average of 7.6 days for a combined estimated 40 million annual average days of treatment. Of these patients, we believe that approximately 40% of cIAI patients require a change in therapy and 50% of patients with cIAI are receiving combination therapy.
 As such, at present, there is an acute need for new drugs to treat MDR Gram-negative bacteria. Currently approved products, such as meropenem, are becoming increasingly ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria due to increasing resistance, limiting patients’ treatment options, particularly for patients with MDR infections. Few new therapeutic agents have been approved or are in clinical development.
 Intra-abdominal infection is classified as uncomplicated or complicated based on the extent of the infection. cIAIs extend beyond the source organ into the peritoneal space (the space between the two membranes that separate the organs in the abdominal cavity from the abdominal wall) as a result of perforation or other damage to the gastrointestinal tract. cIAI diagnoses include intra-abdominal abscess, stomach or intestinal perforation, peritonitis, appendicitis, cholecystitis, or diverticulitis. Different bacterial pathogens are responsible for cIAI, including Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and anaerobic bacteria. Early detection, containment and appropriate antimicrobial treatment are essential to the successful treatment of IAI. This is even more critical with increasing rates of infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria, which limit the effectiveness of currently available antibiotics.
 A nationwide electronic database looked at the prevalence of Gram-negative resistance from 2008-2015 in U.S. hospitals and it showed MDR rates continuing to increase. Out of the 3,158,349 isolates tested 5.3% were considered MDR pathogens. Five bacteria accounted for 92.7% of all MDR isolates:  E coli (39.4%), P aeruginosa (29.4%), K pneumoniae (13.2%), A baumannii (5.4%) and Enterobacter spp (5.2%). The highest rate of MDR was associated with the onset in hospital setting (11.4%), followed by the admission period (6.6%), and the ambulatory setting (3.5%). In the database, 42.9% of A baumannii were MDR isolates. The rate of MDR A baumannii was highest in the inpatient setting (58.6% of isolates from all body sources), followed by admission setting (43.2%), and ambulatory setting (24.8%).
 Legislative initiatives have been approved as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, including the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment Act which would provide a pathway for approval of antibiotics in limited populations of patients with few or no suitable treatment options. Other legislation still pending include the Developing an Innovative Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistant Microorganisms, or DISARM, Act which would remove certain novel antibiotics used to treat serious bacterial infections from the diagnosis-related group and receive a drug specific reimbursement.  
 Limitations of Available Treatment Options
 When confronted with a new patient suffering from a serious infection, such as cIAI, caused by an unknown pathogen, a physician may be required to quickly initiate first-line empiric antibiotic treatment to stabilize the patient prior to definitively diagnosing the particular bacterial infection. However, current antibiotics for first-line empiric treatment of serious bacterial infections suffer from significant limitations, including one or more of the following:
 Insufficient Coverage Against MDR Bacteria. A physician cannot risk prescribing an inappropriate antibiotic when initially treating a patient for a serious infection due to well-documented increased rates of morbidity and mortality associated with ineffective empiric therapy or where the pathogen has not yet been definitively identified. Frequently used products, such as linezolid and daptomycin, are limited to Gram-positive bacteria and thus are rarely used as a first-line empiric monotherapy if broad bacterial coverage is required. Recently approved products are limited to specific Gram-negative bacteria and thus are rarely used as a first-line empiric monotherapy if broad bacterial coverage is required. In addition, other popular antibiotics that have been used as first-line empiric monotherapies, such as levofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam have seen their utility as first-line empiric monotherapies diminished as the number of bacterial strains resistant to these therapies has increased. In response, utilization of broader-spectrum, higher potency antibiotics, such as carbapenems, has increased. This has been accompanied by an increase in resistance to these agents such that the utility of the entire carbapenem class is now threatened. 
 4


Carbapenem Overuse and Increased Resistance. Carbapenems, such as meropenem and ertapenem, are considered the empiric drugs of choice for the treatment of a suspected or document cIAI caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, or ESBL, producing Enterobacteriaceae. Finding alternatives to carbapenems for treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is an urgent medical need. Because ESBL producers are frequently also resistant to fluoroquinolones and piperacillin/tazobactam is less effective than a carbapenem, the options are scarce. The use of carbapenems is growing, which has led to increased resistance. In 2010, carbapenems were used for more than 8 million patient days of therapy, or DOTs, a number which doubled to 16 million DOTs by 2015. In parallel with this increased utilization, carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, has been observed. Increased use of carbapenems is also associated with a higher rate of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
 Penicillin Allergies. It is estimated that 10% of individuals in the United States report having a penicillin allergy which may limit empiric treatment options for serious infections including cIAI. Commonly prescribed alternatives to penicillin include fluoroquinolones, aztreonam or an aminoglycoside. However, these agents do not routinely provide adequate in vitro activity against the common Gram-negative pathogens which cause cIAI. Fluoroquinolones, which are the most commonly prescribed class in patients with penicillin allergies, have a black boxed warning due to serious side effects and are also associated with developing Clostridium difficile, or C. difficile, infection.
 Poor Dose Optimization for Renally Impaired. With all beta-lactams, including carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam, it is necessary to adjust the dose for patients with renal impairment. This may cause problems with ensuring a patient is receiving an optimal dose when there are rapid changes in renal function associated with serious infections like cIAI. Xerava does not require dose adjustment for renal impairment, simplifying dosing in this setting.
 Increased Risk of C. Difficile. Antibiotics are capable of disrupting the normal gut microflora, which can allow for C difficile to flourish and produce toxins. C. difficile is responsible for 20-30% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea cases and is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in the healthcare setting. In general, a longer antibiotic duration and multiple antibiotics are two factors that increase the risk of antibiotic-associated C difficile diarrhea. Clindamycin carries the highest risk of C difficile infection, while fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems carry a fairly high risk,
 Complicated and Expensive Multi-Drug Cocktails and Multi-Dose Regimens. Due to gaps in the spectrum of coverage of antibiotics, physicians are often confronted with the need to design complicated multi-drug cocktails for the first-line empiric treatment of patients with serious infections. The clinical situation is further complicated when each drug in the multi-drug cocktail has a different dosing regimen, such as three or four times a day, resulting in an added burden on the pharmacy and nursing staff, higher costs due to multiple drug administrations and an increased potential for medical errors or drug-drug interactions. We believe that, with the exception of Xerava, most of the antibiotics that are in development or have recently been approved by the FDA that are intended to cover a broad range of bacteria, including Gram-negative bacteria, or solely to address Gram-negative bacteria, are being developed or are approved for use in combination with one or more other antibiotics, and require the addition of a third drug such as metronidazole to address the presence of anaerobic bacteria. Multi-drug regimens may also be associated with toxicities not seen with the individual drugs, such as kidney injury, which has been reported when vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam are given together.
 Safety and Tolerability Concerns. Concerns about antibiotic safety and tolerability are among the leading reasons why patients stop treatment and fail therapy. Antibiotics on the market have been associated with adverse effects such as myelosuppression, seizures, C. difficile colitis, nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, allergies to beta-lactam antibiotics limit the utility of this class of antibiotics for up to 10% of patients. 
 Given these limitations, there is an unmet medical need for empiric antibiotic treatment that has the following characteristics:
  
• | Potency and effectiveness against a broad range of bacteria, including MDR Gram-negative, Gram-positive, atypical and anaerobic bacteria;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Offers an alternative to carbapenems;
--+--------------------------------------


• | Capability of being used as a monotherapy in the majority of patients in the hospital with cIAI and other MDR infections;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A convenient dosing regimen, such as once or twice-daily;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | A favorable safety and tolerability profile;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | No required dose adjustments for patients with impaired renal functions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | No need for therapeutic drug monitoring for any patient group;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potent in vitro activity against C. difficile; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to use in patients with penicillin and beta-lactam allergies
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on our belief that Xerava and our pipeline candidates have, or potentially have, each of these characteristics, our goal is to develop Xerava and our pipeline candidates to be the drug of choice for first-line empiric treatment of a wide variety of serious and life-threatening infections.
 Xerava (Eravacycline)
 Overview
 We developed Xerava using our proprietary chemistry technology, as an IV antibiotic for use as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of multidrug-resistant infections, including MDR Gram-negative infections such as those found in cIAI. On August 27, 2018, the FDA, approved Xerava for the treatment of cIAI in adults. On September 20, 2018, the EC, granted marketing authorization for Xerava for the treatment of cIAI in adults in all 28 countries of the EU, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Approval of Xerava in both the United States and in the EU was based on our IGNITE (Investigating Gram-Negative Infections Treated with Eravacycline) phase 3 program in cIAI.
 To date, we have completed four phase 3 clinical trials with Xerava: IGNITE1 and IGNITE4, each a phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Xerava with IV administration for the treatment of cIAI; IGNITE2, a phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Xerava with IV-to-oral transition therapy for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTI, and IGNITE3, a phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Xerava with IV administration for the t

reatment of cUTI. 
 In each of IGNITE1 and IGNITE4, Xerava met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority compared to the control therapy for the trial and those trials formed the basis of the approval of Xerava by the FDA for the treatment of cIAI. 
 However, Xerava did not meet the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority in IGNITE2 compared to the control therapy for the trial and did not meet the co-primary endpoints of statistical non-inferiority in IGNITE3 compared to the control therapy for the trial. Given these results, we have ceased development of Xerava for the treatment of cUTI, including the oral formulation for Xerava for the treatment of cUTI.
Tetracycline antibiotics have been in clinical use for over 50 years and have a demon
strated record of 
safety and effectiveness. However, as with most classes of antibiotics, a high incidence of resistance among many bacteria has limited their effectiveness and resulted in tetracyclines being relegated to second- or third-line therapy several decades after their introduction. Chemists have generally been unable to synthesize new tetracyclines that could overcome bacterial resistance mechanisms. We have used our proprietary chemistry technology to create more than 3,000 new tetracycline derivatives that we believe could not be practically created with conventional methods. Many of these new derivatives, including Xerava, have been able to overcome bacterial resistance in in vitro studies.
 Xerava is a novel, fully synthetic fluorocycline antibiotic. We selected Xerava for development from tetracycline derivatives that we generated using our proprietary chemistry technology. In designing Xerava, we inserted a fluorine atom into the tetracycline scaffold, which we call a fluorocycline, and modified the scaffold at another position. We believe that these modifications enable Xerava to not be subject to tetracycline-specific mechanisms of drug resistance. As a result, we believe that Xerava is active against MDR bacteria in ways that tetracyclines currently on the market or in development are not.
 In in vitro studies, including a surveillance study published in December 2014 using over 4,000 patient bacterial isolates collected in New York City, Xerava has been highly active against emerging MDR pathogens like Acinetobacter baumannii as well as clinically important species of Enterobacteriaceae, including those isolates that produce ESBLs, or are resistant to the carbapenem class of antibiotics, and anaerobes, in comparison to commonly used antibiotics.
 Data published in August 2016 demonstrated that in in vitro studies, Xerava retained potency against E. coli clinical isolates containing a plasmid expressing mcr-1, the gene associated with colistin resistance (ERV MIC90=0.5 µg/mL; colistin MIC90=16 µg/mL). The in vitro potency of Xerava was unaffected by inducible overexpression of the mcr-1 gene in an engineered laboratory E. coli strain.

Xerava has also demonstrated strong activity in vitro against Gram-positive pathogens, including both nosocomial and community-acquired methicillin susceptible or resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, vancomycin susceptible or resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-susceptible or resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In in vitro studies of pathogens most prevalent in cIAI infections, Xerava consistently exhibited strong activity against enterococci and streptococci. One of the most frequently isolated anaerobic pathogens in cIAI, either as the sole pathogen or often in conjunction with another Gram-negative bacterium, is Bacteroides fragilis. In these studies, Xerava demonstrated activity against Bacteroides fragilis and a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes.
 Key Differentiating Attributes of Xerava
 We believe that the following key attributes of Xerava, observed in clinical trials and preclinical studies, differentiate Xerava from other antibiotics targeting multidrug-resistant infections, including MDR Gram-negative infections. We believe these attributes support Xerava as safe and effective treatment for cIAI and potentially for other serious and life-threatening infections for which we may develop Xerava.

• | Offers a broad range of activity against a wide variety of MDR Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. In our phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials of the IV formulation of Xerava, Xerava demonstrated a high cure rate against a wide variety of MDR Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. In addition, in in vitro studies, Xerava demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae; carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE); MCR-1 gene expressing bacteria; Acinetobacter baumannii, including carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter (CRAB); Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, or VRE; and anaerobic pathogens. As a result, we believe that Xerava has the potential to be used as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of cIAI and potentially other serious and life-threatening infections.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower probability of drug resistance. To date, in the clinical trials and preclinical studies of Xerava that we have conducted for the treatment of cIAI, we have seen little decrease in susceptibility that would suggest increased resistance to Xerava. We believe that, as a fluorocycline, Xerava will not be subject to tetracycline-specific mechanisms of drug resistance in certain MDR pathogens.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Favorable safety and tolerability profile. Xerava has been evaluated in over 2,700 subjects in the phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials that we have conducted through February 2018. In these trials, Xerava has demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. In our phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials of Xerava in patients with cIAI, no patients suffered any drug-related serious adverse events, and safety and tolerability were comparable to the respective control therapies for the trials. In the phase 3 clinical trials of Xerava in patients with cUTI, safety and tolerability were comparable to the respective control therapies for these trials. In addition, in these phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials, the rate at which gastrointestinal adverse events such as nausea and emesis occurred in the Xerava arms was low. Since Xerava is not a beta-lactam, it also offers an alternative treatment for patients with allergies to this commonly used antibiotic class.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower risk of Clostridium difficile colitis. Xerava, like other tetracycline class antibiotics, has shown activity against C. difficile in in vitro studies and, therefore, may be associated with a lower risk of C. difficile colitis compared with other broad-spectrum antibiotics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenient dosing regimen. In our clinical trials to date, we have dosed Xerava once or twice a day as a monotherapy. We believe that Xerava will be able to be administered as a first-line empiric monotherapy with twice-daily dosing, avoiding the need for complicated dosing regimens typical of multi-drug cocktails and the increased risk of negative drug-drug interactions inherent to multi-drug cocktails.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No dosage adjustment required for impaired renal function. Unlike other classes of antibiotics, such as beta-lactams, Xerava does not require dosage adjustment in patients with impaired renal function. In addition to convenience, this ensures that patients with rapidly fluctuating renal function do not have high drug levels, which could lead to toxicity, or low drug levels which could result in loss of efficacy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical Experience
 We have studied IV and oral formulations of Xerava in over 2,700 subjects in 21 clinical trials completed from October 2009 to February 2018.

Phase 3 Clinical Program in cIAI
 We designed our IGNITE phase 3 program for Xerava in cIAI to enable us to position Xerava as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of cIAI due to Xerava’s broad-range of coverage against resistant and MDR infections, including MDR Gram-negative infections.
 Our initial phase 3 clinical trial of Xerava for the treatment of patients with cIAI was our IGNITE1 trial. In December 2014, we announced that Xerava met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority compared to ertapenem in IGNITE1 for the treatment of cIAI. In July 2017, we announced that Xerava met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority compared to meropenem in IGNITE4 for the treatment of cIAI. 
 
IGNITE1
 Eravacycline Phase 3 IGNITE1 Study Design
 
We designed IGNITE1 as a non-inferiority study. Under FDA guidance, the primary endpoint of the trial was clinical response at the test-of-cure, or TOC, visit in the microbiological intent-to-treat, or micro-ITT, population which consisted of all randomized patients in the trial who had baseline bacterial pathogens that cause cIAI and against which Xerava has antibacterial activity. Under EMA guidance, the primary endpoint of the trial was clinical response at the TOC visit in the modified intent-to-treat, or MITT, population which consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug, and in the clinically evaluable, or CE, patient population, which consisted of all randomized patients in the trial who meet key inclusion/exclusion criteria and follow other important components of the trial. We designed the trial to be consistent with the FDA’s cIAI guidance, in which the FDA suggested that the primary efficacy endpoint for a trial of cIAI should be complete resolution of baseline signs and symptoms attributable to cIAI in the micro-ITT patient population 28 days after randomization and the absence of clinical failure including death and unplanned surgical procedures through the period ending 28 days following randomization.
 In December 2014, we announced top-line data from IGNITE1. In the trial, Xerava met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority of clinical response at the TOC visit, under the guidance set by the FDA and the EMA. The primary analysis under the FDA guidance was conducted using a 10% non-inferiority margin in the micro-ITT population. In the micro-ITT population, the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval were -7.1% and 5.5%, respectively. Under the EMA guidance, the primary analysis was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin in the CE and MITT patient populations. In the CE population, the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval were -6.3% and 2.8%, respectively, and the lower and upper bounds of the 99% confidence interval were -7.9% and 4.4%, respectively. In the MITT population, the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval were -7.4% and 3.8%, respectively, and the lower and upper bounds of the 99% confidence interval were -9.2% and 5.6%, respectively. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events for Xerava were gastrointestinal, including nausea (3.3%) and emesis (2.2%). This adverse event profile for Xerava was consistent with that seen in the phase 2 clinical trial of Xerava in cIAI. The spectrum of pathogens in this trial was similar to that seen in other pivotal trials of antibiotics in this patient population. The most common Gram-negative pathogens in the trial included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas and Bacteroides.

IGNITE4
 Eravacycline Phase 3 IGNITE4 Study Design
 
We designed IGNITE4 as a non-inferiority study. Under FDA guidance, the primary endpoint of the trial was clinical response at the TOC visit in the micro-ITT population, which consisted of randomized patients in the trial who had baseline bacterial pathogens that cause cIAI and against which Xerava has antibacterial activity. Under EMA guidance, the primary endpoint of the trial was clinical response at the TOC visit in the MITT population, which consisted of patients in the trial who received at least one dose of study drug, and in the CE patient population, which consisted of patients in the trial who met key inclusion/exclusion criteria and followed other important components of the trial. Secondary endpoints included clinical response at the end-of-treatment, TOC and follow-up visits in the intent-to-treat population, the CE population, the micro-ITT population and the microbiologically evaluable, or ME, population. The ME population consisted of all micro-ITT patients who met key inclusion/exclusion criteria and followed other important components of the trial. In the trial, we also studied microbiologic response at the end-of-treatment and TOC visits in the micro-ITT and ME populations, the safety and tolerability of Xerava in the safety population and pharmacokinetic parameters after Xerava administration.
 On July 25, 2017, we announced top-line data from IGNITE4. In the trial, Xerava met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority of clinical response at the TOC visit, under the guidance set by the FDA and the EMA. The primary efficacy analysis under the FDA guidance was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin in the micro-ITT population. Clinical cure rates in the micro-ITT population were 90.8% and 91.2% for Xerava (n=195) and meropenem (n=205), respectively (95% CI: -6.3%,5.3%). Under the EMA guidance, the primary analysis was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin of the MITT and CE patient populations. Clinical cure rates in the MITT population were 92.4% and 91.6% for Xerava (n=250) and meropenem (n=249), respectively (95% CI: -4.1%,5.8%). Clinical cure rates in the CE population were 96.9% and 96.1% for Xerava (n=225) and meropenem (n=231), respectively (95% CI: -2.9%,4.5%). The secondary analyses were consistent with, and supportive of, the primary outcome. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events for Xerava were gastrointestinal, including nausea (2.4%) and emesis (1.6%). This adverse event profile for Xerava was consistent with that seen in the phase 2 clinical trial of Xerava in cIAI. The spectrum of pathogens in this trial was similar to that seen in other pivotal trials of antibiotics in this patient population. The most common Gram-negative pathogens in the trial included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas and Bacteroides.

TP-6076
 TP-6076, a fully-synthetic fluorocycline derivative, is designed to target unmet medical needs, including MDR Gram-negative bacteria such as Acinetobacter baumannii. We created TP-6076 using our proprietary technology. TP-6076 has demonstrated potent activity in vitro against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter Baumanii (CRAB) as well as efficacy in animal models of CRAB pneumonia. In June 2017, we announced positive results from a phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-ascending dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IV TP-6076. In the study, TP-6076 was well tolerated, and there were no serious or severe adverse events, or discontinuations due to an adverse event. In October 2018, we announced results of a phase 1 study of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of IV TP-6076 in healthy volunteers. In this study, multiple doses of TP-6076 were generally well tolerated with no serious or severe adverse events and no clinically significant findings in any laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECGs, or physical examinations. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 study to assess the bronchopulmonary disposition, pharmacokinetics, and safety of TP-6076 in healthy volunteers.
 Funding for TP-6076 is partially covered by an award from CARB-X. In March 2017, CARB-X selected us to receive up to $4.0 million in research funding over eighteen months for TP-6076. In connection with this funding, we entered into a cost reimbursement Sub-Award Agreement or “Sub-Award Agreement”, with the Trustees of Boston University, the administrator of the program. We began recognizing revenue from the Sub-Award Agreement in April 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized revenue of $2.0 million under this Sub-Award Agreement. Although this Sub-Award Agreement expired by its terms on December 31, 2018, we expect to reach an agreement with CARB-X to extend the performance date out to June 30, 2019. This Sub-Award Agreement can be terminated for convenience at any time, subject to 30 days prior written notice.
 TP-271
 TP-271 is a fully-synthetic, broad-spectrum fluorocycline developed for the treatment of respiratory diseases caused by bacterial biothreat pathogens under funding provided by NIAID in collaboration with CUBRC.
 We created TP-271 using our proprietary chemistry technology. In doing so, we made modifications to the tetracycline scaffold that were designed to improve potency and effectiveness against a broader spectrum of bacteria as compared to tetracycline and doxycycline, which are currently used for the treatment of pneumonia and other respiratory ailments.
 In our development program for TP-271, we have conducted a number of in vitro, toxicology and animal studies to evaluate the efficacy of TP-271 against biothreat pathogens. TP-271 has performed as well as, or better than, standard-of-care comparators in studies in murine respiratory infection models challenged with public health pathogens. In susceptibility studies, TP-271 also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against NIAID Category A and B public health bacterial pathogens including Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Bacillus anthracis, and NIAID Category C public health bacterial pathogens (in vitro and in vivo) that are associated with CABP, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, including MDR pneumococci, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Legionella pneumophila, including strains that are tetracycline-resistant. 
 In June 2017, we announced positive results from a phase 1 single-ascending dose clinical trial of the IV formulation of TP-271 in healthy volunteers. In the study, TP-271 was well-tolerated at single doses that resulted in high plasma exposures. There were no clinically significant changes in lab values, ECG parameters, or physical exam findings. There were no serious or severe adverse events, or discontinuations due to an adverse event during the study. We also completed a single-ascending dose trial for the oral formulation of TP-271, and multiple-ascending dose trials for the IV and oral formulations of TP-271. We expect to report results of these studies at a future scientific meeting. In February 2017, we received Qualified Infectious Disease Product and Fast Track designations from the FDA for TP-271.
 For explanation of the funding for TP-271 and for further discussion of our contract and grant revenue agreements see Note 3, Significant Agreements and Contracts to the consolidated financial statements.
TP-2846
 TP-2846 is a fully-synthetic tetracycline that we are developing for the treatment of AML. We have recently initiated pre-clinical toxicology studies in this program. In pre-clinical studies, TP-2846 demonstrated significant activity against leukemia cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo.

Sales and Marketing
 We have established a targeted commercial organization in the United States to support the launch of Xerava. As of March 1, 2019, we had approximately 40 sales representatives, three strategic market access executives and approximately 10 medical affairs personnel supporting Xerava. Our sales force has on average 25 years of hospital sales experience and launching antibiotics. We also have tenured and focused marketing and sales operations teams located at our headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts.
 Our commercialization strategy is to develop our product candidates into leading therapies that will be available worldwide for the treatment of serious MDR infections. We have retained worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates other than Xerava in China and other Asian territories. We exclusively licensed our commercial rights to Xerava in China and other Asian territories to Everest Medicines Limited in February 2018. In the future we may enter into additional regional licensing transactions similar to the Everest license agreement. We intend to retain control over the commercial execution of Xerava and any product candidate in the United States and in certain countries in the EU.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of Xerava or any of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. Xerava and our product candidates are organic compounds of low molecular weight, commonly referred to as small molecules. They are manufactured in a fully synthetic process from readily available starting materials. 
 We currently rely on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and finished product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties other than with respect to our agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production of Xerava. We currently employ internal resources to manage our third-party manufacturing relationships.
 Patheon UK Limited Master Manufacturing Services Agreement
 In June 2017, we and Patheon UK Limited and certain of its affiliates, or Patheon, entered into a master manufacturing services agreement, or the Patheon agreement. Under the Patheon agreement, we are responsible for supplying the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Xerava to Patheon, and Patheon is responsible for manufacturing Xerava, conducting quality control, quality assurance, analytical testing and stability testing and packaging. We entered into two related product agreements pursuant to the Patheon agreement that govern the terms and conditions of Patheon’s manufacture of commercial supplies of Xerava at Patheon’s Greenville, North Carolina and Ferentino, Italy manufacturing sites. Each product agreement is governed by the terms of the Patheon agreement, unless expressly modified in such product agreement. Pursuant to the Patheon agreement, we have agreed to order from Patheon at least a certain percentage of our annual commercial requirements for Xerava in the United States and European Union each year for the term of the Patheon agreement.
 Under the Patheon agreement, we will submit to Patheon by a date in June of a calendar year the forecast for the following two years that sets forth the total quantity of Xerava commercial supply that we expect to order from Patheon. Patheon has no obligation to manufacture the Xerava commercial supply in accordance with any forecast which is increased by a certain percentage above the previously forecast amount.
 The Patheon agreement has an initial term ending December 31, 2022, and will automatically renew after the initial term for successive terms of two years each, unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate at least 18 months prior to the end of the then current term. We may terminate a product agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice if any governmental agency takes any action that prevents us from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling Xerava. Either party may terminate the Patheon agreement or a product agreement (a) upon written notice if the other party has failed to remedy a material breach under the Patheon agreement or a product agreement within a specified time following receipt of written notice of such breach, and (b) immediately upon written notice to the other party in the event that the other party is declared insolvent or bankrupt, a voluntary petition of bankruptcy is filed in any court by such other party or the Pantheon agreement or a product agreement is assigned by such other party for the benefit of creditors. Patheon may terminate the Patheon agreement or a product agreement upon six months written notice if we assign the Patheon agreement to an assignee that, in the opinion of Patheon acting reasonably, is (i) not a creditworthy substitute for us or (ii) a competitor of Patheon.
 The Patheon agreement contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, a grant to Patheon of certain limited license rights to our intellectual property in connection with Patheon’s performance of the services under the Patheon agreement, certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties, limitations of liability and customary confidentiality provisions.

Finorga SAS Commercial Supply Agreement
 In October 2017, we and Finorga SAS, or Novasep entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement, or the Novasep agreement. Under the Novasep agreement, Novasep will, pursuant to accepted purchase orders entered into under the Novasep agreement, manufacture for commercial supply the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for Xerava for us.
 Under the Novasep agreement, we will submit to Novasep on a periodic basis on or before the first business day of each calendar quarter a rolling forecast for a certain time period that sets forth the total quantity of the API for Xerava for commercial supply that we either have ordered, desire to order or expect to order from Novasep. A certain time period of each such forecast is binding on us and constitutes a “firm order”. The remainder of each forecast will be for planning purposes only and will not be binding. Novasep has no obligation to manufacture the API for Xerava in accordance with any forecast that is not the subject of a firm order and which is increased by a certain percentage above the previously forecast amount.
 The Novasep agreement has an initial term ending October 16, 2022, and will automatically renew after the initial term, unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate at least 18 months prior to the end of the then current term. We may terminate the Novasep agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice (a) if any regulatory authority takes any action, or raises any objection, that prevents us from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling the API for Xerava, or (b) in the event that Novasep experiences a force majeure event. Either party may terminate the Novasep agreement (a) upon written notice if the other party has failed to remedy a material breach under the Novasep agreement within a specified time following receipt of written notice of such breach, and (b) immediately upon written notice to the other party in the event the other party makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or proceedings of a case are commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction by or against the other party seeking (i) such party’s reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, arrangement or winding up, or the composition or readjustment of its debts, (ii) the appointment of a receiver or trustee for or over such party’s property, or (iii) similar relief in respect of such party under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, winding up or composition or adjustment of debt, and such proceedings shall continue undismissed, or an order with respect to the foregoing shall be entered and continue unstayed, for a period of more than 60 days.
 The Novasep agreement contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, a grant to Novasep of certain limited license rights to the Company’s intellectual property in connection with Novasep’s performance of the services under the Novasep agreement, certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties, limitations of liability and customary confidentiality provisions.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 Our success will significantly depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology and inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 As of February 13, 2019, we owned 11 U.S. patents, 65 foreign patents, nine pending U.S. patent applications, two pending applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, and 50 pending foreign patent applications in Europe and 20 other jurisdictions. The PCT is an international patent law treaty that provides a unified procedure for filing a single initial patent application for an invention simultaneously in each of the member states. Although a PCT application is not itself examined and cannot issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications. In addition, we have exclusively licensed from Harvard University rights under 12 U.S. patents, 34 foreign patents, one pending U.S. patent application and six pending foreign patent applications in Europe and ten other jurisdictions. Certain of our patents and patent applications are directed to the composition of matter and/or use of Xerava and patents have granted, or applications are pending in the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries.

Tetraphase-Owned Intellectual Property Relating to Xerava and Other Compounds Under Development
 We have patent applications directed to the composition of matter and/or use of Xerava and other fluorocyclines pending in the United States and other countries. In addition, patents specific to the composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and/or use of Xerava have been granted in the United States, Europe, Australia, China, Colombia, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Israel and Singapore. The granted patents have an expiration date of August 7, 2029, and any patents that may issue from the pending applications will also have an expiration date of August 7, 2029, absent any term extensions or adjustments that may be available. The term of one of the United States patents has received 508 days of patent term adjustment under the America Invents Act.
 We have a pending PCT application directed to crystalline forms of Xerava. Any patents that may issue based on the pending PCT Application will have an expiration date no earlier than 2037.
 We have also filed patent applications directed to the composition of matter and use of various derivatives of tetracycline and pentacycline (a tetracycline scaffold extended to five rings) under the PCT and in the United States, Europe and other foreign countries. Any patents that might issue from these pending applications will have an expiration date no earlier than 2030, with some expiration dates as late as 2038.
 Exclusively Licensed Intellectual Property Relating to Our Proprietary Chemistry Technology
 The patents and patent applications that we exclusively license from Harvard provide patent protection for the proprietary chemistry technology used in our fully synthetic process to make Xerava and other tetracycline derivatives. The key intermediates that enable our fully synthetic process are commonly referred to as enone intermediates. The licensed patents and patent applications are directed towards the composition of matter of enone intermediates and compounds used to make the enone intermediates, referred to as key precursors, as well as synthetic routes to those enone intermediates, precursors and our tetracycline derivatives under development.
 Composition of matter for the enone intermediates and precursors used in preparing the enone intermediates, and methods of making the precursors and enone intermediates are covered by the U.S. patents we license from Harvard, which will expire no earlier than 2025, not taking into consideration patent term adjustment. Corresponding patent applications have been filed in foreign jurisdictions and any patents that have issued and might issue from these applications also expire or will expire no earlier than 2025.
 Exclusively Licensed Intellectual Property Relating to Pentacycline and Tetracycline Derivatives
 Our license from Harvard also includes patent applications directed to the composition of matter and use of other novel tetracycline or pentacycline derivatives. These applications are pending in the United States, Europe and other countries. Any patents that might issue from these pending applications will have an expiration date no earlier than 2027.
 Patent Term and Patent Term Extensions
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved pursuant to a pre-market approval may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension and only those claims reading on the approved drug are extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. 
Trademark Applications Relating to the Company Name and Logo 
 As of February 13, 2019, we owned eight intent-to-use trademark applications pending before the United States Patent and Trademark Office relating to the Company Name, the Company Logo, combinations thereof, drug names and design marks relating to Xerava.

Trade Secrets
 We rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our unpatented technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached. We may not have adequate remedies for any breach and could lose our trade secrets through such a breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting trade secrets, know-how and inventions.
Third-Party License Agreements
 On August 3, 2006, we entered into a license agreement with The President and Fellows of Harvard College, under which Harvard granted us an exclusive worldwide license under specified Harvard patent rights to develop and commercialize tetracycline-based products such as Xerava. Under the license agreement, we also have the right to expand the patent rights subject to the license to include improvement patents that may be owned by Harvard in the future and that meet specified criteria by paying to Harvard an additional license issuance fee in an amount to be agreed between Harvard and us. We also have a right of negotiation to expand the license to include additional patents relating to tetracycline chemistry within a specified category that may be owned by Harvard in the future, including patents covering inventions made by Andrew Myers, Ph.D., our scientific founder, under his consulting agreement with us. Since entering into the license agreement, we have entered into amendments to the license agreement pursuant to which we expanded the patent rights subject to the license in accordance with these rights. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to satisfy diligence requirements, including using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed compounds and to implement a specified development plan, meeting specified development milestones and providing an update on progress on an annual basis. Our license grant from Harvard is subject to academic rights retained by Harvard and United States government rights and obligations that are customary in patent license agreements with universities in the United States.
 In consideration for the rights granted to us by Harvard under the license agreement, as of December 31, 2018, we have paid Harvard an aggregate of $15.8 million in upfront license fees, sublicense fees and development milestone payments and issued 31,379 shares of our common stock to Harvard. We have also agreed to make payments to Harvard upon the achievement of specified future development and regulatory milestones totaling up to $15.1 million for each licensed product candidate ($12.6 million of which has already been paid with respect to Xerava), and to pay tiered royalties in the single digits based on annual worldwide net sales, if any, of licensed products by us, our affiliates and sublicensees in certain circumstances. We are also obligated to pay Harvard a specified share of non-royalty sublicensing and other revenues that we receive from sublicensees for the grant of sublicenses under the license in certain circumstances, and to reimburse Harvard for specified patent prosecution and maintenance costs.
 The Harvard license agreement expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering the applicable product in the applicable country that is included in the license. Harvard may terminate the license agreement based on our uncured material breach or insolvency or bankruptcy. We have the right to terminate the license agreement for any or no reason at any time on sixty (60) days prior written notice to Harvard.
 Government Contracts
 Xerava
 We received funding for Xerava under an award from BARDA. In January 2012, BARDA awarded to CUBRC a five-year contract that provided a total of up to $67.3 million in funding. The BARDA Contract contemplates that CUBRC will collaborate with us on the development, manufacturing and clinical evaluation of a novel tetracycline antibiotic with potential as an empiric countermeasure for respiratory diseases caused by biothreat and antibiotic-resistant public health pathogens, including Francisella tularensis, which causes tularemia, Yersinia pestis, which causes plague, and Bacillus anthracis, which causes anthrax disease, as well as bacterial pathogens associated with moderate-to-severe CABP and other serious hospital infections. The BARDA Contract also provided funding for certain activities in the development of Xerava to treat certain infections caused by life-threatening multidrug-resistant bacteria. In connection with the BARDA Contract, in February 2012, we entered into a cost-plus-fixed-fee subcontract with CUBRC under which we can receive up to $41.8 million to fund specific work performed by us related to Xerava. The terms of the subcontract expire on March 30, 2019.
 14


We collaborated with CUBRC in seeking government funding of this development program because we did not have any expertise in bidding for, or the administration and management of, government-funded contracts. Because CUBRC had the expertise to manage and administer awards issued by government funding agencies, we agreed with CUBRC that CUBRC would serve as the prime contractor under the BARDA Contract, primarily carrying out a program management and administrative role with additional responsibility for the management of certain preclinical studies. We serve as lead technical experts on all aspects of the BARDA Contract and serve as a subcontractor of CUBRC responsible for management of chemistry, manufacturing and control activities and clinical studies. The flow of funds under this arrangement follows the respective activities being conducted by us and by CUBRC, with funds being paid to us under our subcontract with CUBRC reflecting payment for our activities.
 We have agreed upon a research plan with CUBRC detailing the activities to be conducted by CUBRC and by us. In addition to our obligations to conduct the activities provided for by the research plan, we are also obligated under the CUBRC subcontract to satisfy various federal reporting requirements, extending to technical reporting with respect to our activities, reporting with respect to intellectual property and financial reporting.
 Payments under our subcontract with CUBRC are made in installments as activities are conducted in accordance with the research plan. Payments are based on direct and indirect costs incurred plus fixed fees, where applicable.
 Under the subcontract, CUBRC’s use of our Xerava data is expressly limited to purposes of performing CUBRC’s obligations under the BARDA Contract, and CUBRC and its other subcontractors must assign to us, subject to government rights, all intellectual property rights relating to our compounds and related data that arise from the project. Under standard government contracting terms, the government receives only limited rights for government use of certain of our pre-existing data and certain data produced with non-federal funding, to the extent such data are required for delivery to BARDA under the project. The government receives unlimited rights to use and disclose new data first produced under the project with BARDA funding, and the government is entitled to at least a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to practice or have practiced any patent on an invention that is conceived or first reduced to practice under the project.
 BARDA is entitled to terminate the project for convenience at any time and is not obligated to provide continued funding beyond current-year amounts from Congressionally approved annual appropriations, and CUBRC has a right to terminate its subcontract with us only to the extent that BARDA first cancels the corresponding portions of CUBRC’s prime contract.
 We retain a right to terminate CUBRC’s rights to use Xerava. Permissible grounds for such termination of CUBRC’s rights include but are not limited to the sale of our assets relating to the project, an acquisition of us or our granting an exclusive or partially exclusive license to use Xerava to a licensee that declines to continue CUBRC’s license rights. In such an event, the subcontract may be terminated upon CUBRC’s negotiation of a corresponding termination of CUBRC’s obligations to BARDA.
 TP-6076
 Our program to develop TP-6076 is partially covered by an award from CARB-X. In March 2017, CARB-X selected the Company to receive up to $4.0 million in research funding over eighteen months for TP-6076. In connection with this funding, the Company entered into a cost reimbursement Sub-Award Agreement with the Trustees of Boston University, the administrator of the program. Although this Sub-Award Agreement expired by its terms on December 31, 2018, we expect to reach an agreement with CARB-X to extend the performance date out to June 30, 2019. This Sub-Award Agreement can be terminated for convenience at any time, subject to 30 days prior written notice.
 TP-271
 Our program to develop TP-271 is funded by NIAID through the NIAID Grant, a grant awarded in July 2011 that provided up to approximately $2.9 million in funding, and the NIAID Contract, a separate agreement that provides up to $35.8 million in funding that NIAID awarded to CUBRC in October 2011. The NIAID Contract and the NIAID Grant contemplate that CUBRC will collaborate with us on the development, manufacturing and clinical evaluation of a novel broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic for respiratory diseases caused by biothreat and antibiotic-resistant public health pathogens, including Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis and Bacillus anthracis, as well as bacterial pathogens associated with CABP. 
 In connection with the NIAID Contract, in October 2011, we entered into a subcontract with CUBRC under which we may receive funding of up to approximately $16.9 million, reflecting the portion of the NIAID Contract funding that may be paid to us for our activities. The term of the NIAID subcontract now runs through March 31, 2019. In connection with the NIAID Grant, in November 2011, CUBRC awarded us a subaward of approximately $0.9 million, reflecting the portion of the NIAID Grant funding that may be paid to us for our activities. The term of the sub-award under the NIAID grant expired in May 2017.

 Under the subcontract, CUBRC’s use and disclosure of our proprietary data pertaining to the project are expressly subject to a separate confidentiality agreement between CUBRC and us. CUBRC and its other subcontractors or sub-awardees must assign to us, subject to government rights, all intellectual property rights relating to our compounds and related data that arise from the project. Under standard government contracting terms and grant conditions, the government is entitled to at least a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to practice or have practiced any patent on an invention that is conceived or first reduced to practice under the project.
 NIAID is entitled to terminate the NIAID Contract for convenience at any time and is not obligated to provide continued funding beyond March 31, 2019 and CUBRC has a right to terminate its subcontract with, or subaward to, us only to the extent that NIAID first cancels the corresponding portions of CUBRC’s prime contract or award.
 We retain rights to terminate the subcontract if CUBRC breaches the subcontract, subject in certain cases to CUBRC’s failure to cure such breach, or by written notice to CUBRC, effective upon CUBRC’s negotiation of a corresponding termination of CUBRC’s obligations to NIAID.
 Collaborations 
 In February 2018, we entered into a license agreement, which we call the Everest license agreement, with Everest Medicines Limited, or Everest Medicines, whereby we granted Everest Medicines an exclusive license to develop and commercialize eravacycline, for the treatment of cIAI and other indications, in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea and Singapore, or the territory. 
 Under the terms of the Everest license agreement, we received from Everest Medicines an upfront cash payment of $7.0 million and are entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $16.5 million in clinical development and regulatory milestone payments and up to $20.0 million provided that certain sales thresholds are met. To date, we have received $2.5 million from Everest in clinical development and regulatory milestones. There can be no guarantee that any such milestones or sales thresholds will in fact be met. We are obligated to make certain payments to Harvard based on amounts received from Everest Medicines under the Everest license agreement pursuant to the existing license agreement by and between Harvard and us. 
 We will also be entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalties on sales in the territory, if any, of products containing eravacycline. Royalties are payable with respect to each jurisdiction in the territory until the latest to occur of: (i) the last-to-expire of specified patent rights in such jurisdiction in the territory; (ii) expiration of marketing or regulatory exclusivity in such jurisdiction in the territory; or (iii) ten (10) years after the first commercial sale of a product in such jurisdiction in the territory. In addition, royalties payable under the Everest license agreement will be subject to reduction on account of generic competition and after patent expiry in a jurisdiction if required by applicable law, with any such reductions capped at certain percentages of the amounts otherwise payable during the applicable royalty payment period. 
 Under the terms and conditions of the Everest license agreement, Everest Medicines will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of licensed products in the territory. 
 16


If either we or Everest Medicines materially breaches the Everest license agreement and does not cure such breach within 90 days (or fewer days in certain cases), the non-breaching party may terminate the Everest license agreement in its entirety. However, if the breach relates only to any jurisdiction other than mainland China, the non-breaching party may only terminate the Everest license agreement with respect to such jurisdiction. Either party may also terminate the Everest license agreement, effective immediately upon written notice, if the other party files for bankruptcy, is dissolved or has a receiver appointed for substantially all of its property. We may terminate the Everest license agreement if Everest Medicines, its affiliates or its sublicensees challenges the validity or enforceability of any of our patents covering any of the licensed compounds or products. In certain circumstances, if we materially breach the Everest license agreement Everest Medicines may reduce royalties owed to us in lieu of a termination. Moreover, if we materially breach the Everest license agreement and Everest Medicines terminates the Everest license agreement with respect to any jurisdiction and we then commercializes a licensed product in that jurisdiction, we will pay to Everest Medicines a low, single digit royalty on such sales of the licensed product in such jurisdiction for a minimum of five years after such termination.
 Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. Many of our potential competitors have greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our potential competitors may be more successful than us in achieving widespread market acceptance. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our product candidates less competitive or obsolete.
 We believe the key competitive factors that may affect the commercial success of Xerava for the treatment of cIAI are; efficacy, coverage of drug-resistant strains of bacteria, safety and tolerability profile, convenience of dosing, price, and the availability of reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payers. Outside factors that may affect the commercial success of Xerava are increased resistance trends, changes in the reimbursement landscape, and the approval/availability of rapid diagnostics.
 We are selling Xerava as an IV antibiotic for use as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of cIAI. Xerava competes with a number of antibiotics that are currently marketed for the treatment of cIAI and other multidrug resistant infections, including meropenem, which is marketed by AstraZeneca as Merrem, imipenem/cilastatin, which is marketed by Merck & Co., or Merck, as Primaxin, tigecycline, which is marketed by Pfizer as Tygacil, piperacillin/tazobactam, which is marketed by Pfizer as Zosyn, ceftolozane/tazobactam, which is marketed by Merck as Zerbaxa, and ceftazidime/avibactam, which is marketed by Allergan, Inc., and AstraZeneca as Avycaz, meropenem and vaborbactam, which is marketed by Melinta Therapeutics as Vabomere, In addition, there are  several antibiotics currently in phase 3 development for cIAI such as sulopenem being developed by Iterum Therapeutics; azetronam/avibactam being developed by Pfizer; and imipenem/relebactam being developed by Merck & Co. We also expect that Xerava will compete with future and current generic versions of marketed antibiotics.
 We believe that Xerava may compete effectively against these compounds on the basis of:
  
• | broad range of activity against a wide variety of resistant and MDR Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | lower probability of drug resistance;
--+--------------------------------------


• | a favorable safety and tolerability profile;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | effectiveness in patients with allergies to beta-lactam;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | a convenient dosing regimen with no need for adjustment for renal impairment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | lower risk of C. Difficile;
--+----------------------------


• | approval as a monotherapy; and
--+-------------------------------


• | no drug to drug interactions.

Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, clinical trials, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, authorization, pharmacovigilance, adverse event reporting, recalls, packaging, storage, record keeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products and product candidates such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil and/or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a drug product which includes not only the results of the clinical trials but also detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labelling for one or more proposed indication(s);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 18


The IND and IRB Processes
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a 
foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical
 study is 
conducted under an IND
, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When 
a foreign clinical 
study 
is not conducted under an IND, the 
sponsor must ensure that 
the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as s
upport for an NDA. The final rule provides that such studies must be 
conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirem
ents in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for 
clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides recommendations   as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use 
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 19


When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended) a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational drugs 
for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect. This provision requires drug and biologic companies to make publicly available their policies for expanded access for individual patient access to products intended for serious diseases. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. 
 Human Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial along with the requirement to ensure that the data and results reported from the clinical trials are credible and accurate. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the criteria for determining subject eligibility, the dosing plan, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, the procedure for timely reporting of adverse events, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB representing each clinical site participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. The FDA may impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into a limited number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. During phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s or biological product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid phase 2 clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a larger, but still limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled and closely monitored.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve a larger number of participants than a phase 2 clinical trial.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
 20


Progress reports detailing the status and a brief description of available results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period or completed at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 Furthermore, the FDA is not required to complete its review within the established ten-month timeframe and may extend the review process by issuing requests for additional information or clarification. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. Our product candidates are not designated as orphan drugs.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is typically a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 21


Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 The FDA generally accepts data from foreign clinical trials in support of an NDA if the trials were conducted under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA nevertheless may accept the data in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if deemed necessary. The FDA also expects an explanation of how the foreign data are applicable to the United States population and United States medical practice.
 The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications, and potentially subject to additional restrictions such as a REMS. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific deficiencies in the NDA and conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA, which may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, or if the drug qualifies as a QIDP under the recently enacted Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now, or GAIN, Act. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy in a number of different ways. Fast track designation provides additional opportunities for interaction with the FDA’s review team and may allow for rolling review of NDA components before the completed application is submitted. 
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment for a serious condition or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. 
 22


In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, meaning that it may be approved on (1) the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or (2) on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures.
 Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include much of the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program and organizational commitment involving senior FDA managers.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Limited Population Antibacterial Drug Pathway
 With passage of the Cures Act, Congress authorized the FDA to approve an antibacterial or antifungal drug, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, as a “limited population drug.” To qualify for this approval pathway, the drug must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population of patients with unmet needs; the standards for approval of drugs and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, must be satisfied; and the FDA must receive a written request from the sponsor to approve the drug as a limited population drug pursuant to this provision. The FDA’s determination of safety and effectiveness for such a product must reflect the benefit-risk profile of such drug in the intended limited population, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the infection the drug is intended to treat and the availability or lack of alternative treatment in such a limited population.
 Any drug or biologic approved under this pathway must be labeled with the statement “Limited Population” in a prominent manner and adjacent to the proprietary name of the drug or biological product. The prescribing information must also state that the drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients and copies of all promotional materials relating to the drug must be submitted to the FDA at least 30 days prior to dissemination of the materials. If the FDA subsequently approves the drug for a broader indication, the agency may remove any post-marketing conditions, including requirements with respect to labeling and review of promotional materials applicable to the product. Nothing in this pathway to approval of a limited population drug prevents sponsors of such products from seeking designation or approval under other provisions of the FDCA, such as accelerated approval.
 Post-Approval Regulation
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record keeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, many changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 23


The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products that are placed on the market. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved, and approved drugs may generally be promoted only for their approved indications. Promotional claims must also be consistent with the product’s FDA-approved label, including claims related to safety and effectiveness. The FDA restricts drug manufacturers’ communications regarding uses not described in the FDA-approved labeling, known as off-label uses. The FDA and other federal agencies also closely regulate the promotion of drugs in specific contexts such as direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and education activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences of regulatory non-compliance include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on, or suspensions of, the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | interruption of production processes, including the shutdown of manufacturing facilities or production lines or the imposition of new manufacturing requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | warning letters or other enforcement letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to an RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
 24


Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
 The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight months for a drug that has three or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of ‘‘competitor generic therapies’’ or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 25


To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Qualified Infectious Disease Product Exclusivity
 Under the GAIN provisions of FDASIA, which was signed into law in July 2012, the FDA may designate a product as a “qualified infectious disease product,” or QIDP. In order to receive this designation, a drug must qualify as an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by either (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens, or (2) a so-called “qualifying pathogen” found on a list of potentially dangerous, drug-resistant organisms to be established and maintained by the FDA. A sponsor must request such designation before submitting a marketing application. We obtained a QIDP designation for the IV formulation of Xerava for cIAI in July 2013, the oral formulation in March 2014, the IV formulation of TP-271 in September 2015, the oral formulation of TP-271 in February 2017, and expect to request QIDP designations for our other product candidates prior to submitting a marketing application for such product candidates, as appropriate.
 Upon approving an application for a qualified infectious disease product, the FDA will extend by an additional five years any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded, such as a five-year exclusivity period awarded for a new molecular entity. This extension is in addition to any pediatric exclusivity extension awarded, and the extension will be awarded only to a drug first approved on or after the date of enactment.
 The GAIN provisions prohibit the grant of an exclusivity extension where the application is a supplement to an application for which an extension is in effect or has expired, is a subsequent application for a specified change to an approved product, or is an application for a product that does not meet the definition of qualified infectious disease product based on the uses for which it is ultimately approved.
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 For drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than 90 days after FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits an NDA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the NDA if the drug is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary efficacy to inform pediatric labeling for the product.
 26


Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, marketing authorization, safety reporting and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit an application for marketing authorization through several different procedures. These are the centralized, mutual recognition procedure, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (single EU Member State). The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicinal products. The centralized marketing authorization procedure is optional for medicinal products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the EEA or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which grant of centralized marketing authorization is in the interest of patients in the EU. Under the centralized procedure, an application for marketing authorization is submitted to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years. The authorization may be renewed and remain valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the European Commission decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. The renewal of a marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities or the EMA. The decentralized authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for authorization simultaneously in several EU Member States for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State. The competent authorities of a single EU Member State, the reference member state, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment. The only exception to this is where an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product. In these circumstances, the matter is submitted to the Heads of Medicines Agencies, or CMDh for review. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States.
 27


In the EU, innovative medicinal products that are subject to marketing authorization on the basis of a full dossier qualify for eight years of data exclusivity from the data of marketing authorization and 10 years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application or biosimilar application for eight years from the data of authorization of the innovative product. After this period an application for marketing authorization for a generic or biosimilar product may be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced. However, even if authorization is granted in relation to the generic product or biosimilar product this product cannot be marketed in the EU until 10 years after grant of authorization for the innovative product. The ten year market exclusivity period may be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years following authorization of the innovative product, authorization is granted for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation. This includes requirements to conduct pharmacovigilance, and to assess and monitor the safety of medicinal products.
 Various requirements apply to the manufacturing and placing of medicinal products on the EU market. Manufacture of medicinal products in the EU requires a manufacturing authorization. The manufacturing authorization holder must comply with requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and APIs. These obligations extend to the manufacture of APIs outside of the EU for import into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. Marketing authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU Member States’ requirements applicable to the manufacturing of medicinal products.
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Breaches of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of medicinal products to the general public and may also impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive in a manner that is often not uniform. This has led to variations in the rules governing the conduct of clinical trials in the individual EU Member States. The EU legislator adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the Clinical Trials Regulation in 2014. The new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, which will replace the EU Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The Clinical Trials Regulation is expected to start to apply in late 2019 or in 2020. 
 Clinical trials must currently be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Directive and applicable good clinical practice standards, as implemented into national legislation by EU Member States. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of EU Member State where there is a site at which the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 28


General Data Protection Regulation
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party pro
cessors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the 
United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
 Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, such as government health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and limiting the coverage and reimbursement amounts for medical products and services. 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 In the United States, the federal government provides health insurance for people who are 65 or older, and certain people with disabilities or certain conditions irrespective of their age, through the Medicare program, which is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. Coverage and reimbursement for products and services under Medicare are determined in accordance with the Social Security Act and pursuant to regulations promulgated by CMS, as well as the agency’s subregulatory coverage and reimbursement guidance and determinations. 
 Medicaid is a health insurance program for low-income children, families, pregnant women, and people with disabilities that is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, but administered by the states. In general, state Medicaid programs are required to cover drugs and biologicals of manufacturers that have entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement, although such drugs and biologicals may be subject to prior authorization or other utilization controls.
 In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives to expand health care coverage, improve health care quality, and contain health care costs, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, known collectively as ACA, substantially changes the way health care is financed by United States governmental and commercial payors, and significantly affects the United States pharmaceutical industry. Among other things, the ACA establishes annual fees and taxes to be paid by manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs; creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, under which, as a condition of coverage of their products under Medicare Part D, manufacturers currently must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off of negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period; increases manufacturer rebate liabilities under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid recipients; addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are injected, inhaled, infused, instilled, or implanted, and for line extensions of current drugs; and expands oversight and support for the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research of services and products. 
 29


Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, and certain provisions have been subject to judicial or Congressional challenges. In addition, there have been efforts by the Trump Administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA, and to alter the implementation of the ACA and related laws. And legislation affecting implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed into law a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that, among other things, delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the annual fee imposed on certain high-cost employer-sponsored health plans, commonly referred to as the “Cadillac” health plan tax; the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share; and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare prescription drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the ACA remain possible. It is unclear how the ACA and its implementation, as well as efforts to repeal or replace, or invalidate, the ACA, or portions thereof, will affect our business. We participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental pricing programs, and we have obligations to report the average sales price for certain of our drugs to the Medicare program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental programs impose obligations to report pricing figures to the federal government and we are subject to these price reporting and other compliance obligations. Other programs impose limits on the price we are permitted to charge certain entities for our products. Statutory and regulatory changes or other agency action regarding these programs and their requirements could negatively affect the coverage and reimbursement by these programs of our products and could negatively impact our results of operations.
 Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the state for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug, which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts, and other price concessions. The ACA made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, and CMS issued a final regulation, which became effective on April 1, 2016, to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the ACA. Our failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment options could negatively impact our financial results.
 Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing discount program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. Changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid Drug Rebate amount under the ACA or otherwise also could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.
 HRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. HRSA also has announced that it will begin to implement a ceiling price reporting requirement related to the 340B program during the first quarter of 2019. It is currently unclear how HRSA will apply its enforcement authority under the new regulation. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in the inpatient setting.
 Federal law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program report average sales price information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under the Medicare Part B program. Manufacturers calculate the average sales price based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. Statutory or regulatory changes or CMS guidance could affect the average sales price calculations for our products and the resulting Medicare payment rate, and could negatively impact our results of operations. Also, the Medicare Part B drug payment methodology is subject to change based on potential demonstration projects undertaken by CMS or potential legislation enacted by Congress.
 30


Pricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount is computed each quarter based on our submission to CMS of our average manufacturer prices and best prices for the quarter. If we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price under the 340B program.
 We could be held liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false price information to the government, if we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, if we fail to submit the required price data on a timely basis, or if we are found to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. Such conduct also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect.
 In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. Under this program, we are obligated to make our innovative products available for procurement on an FSS contract under which we must comply with standard government terms and conditions and charge a price to certain federal agencies that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP. The FCP is based on the non-federal average manufacturer price, or Non-FAMP, which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis.  
 Pricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. Risks relating to price reporting and payment obligations under the foregoing programs are further discussed in the risk factor under the heading, “If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.”
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, in the EU, the sole legal instrument at the EU level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC, or the Price Transparency Directive. The aim of this Directive is to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in the EU Member States are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement of and trade in medicinal products in the EU, and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Price Transparency Directive does not provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual EU Member States, nor does it have any direct consequence for pricing or reimbursement levels in individual EU Member States. The EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and/or reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the medicinal product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms.
 Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. The HTA process in the EU Member States is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact, and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product vary between EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of our products by a leading and recognized HTA body could not only undermine our ability to obtain reimbursement for such product in the EU Member State in which such negative assessment was issued, but also in other EU Member States. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms could rely to some extent on the HTA performed in countries with a developed HTA framework, such as France, Germany or Sweden, when adopting decisions concerning the pricing and reimbursement of a specific medicinal product.

On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on HTA. This legislative proposal is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The proposal provides that EU Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. The European Commission has stated that the role of the draft HTA regulation is not to influence pricing and reimbursement decisions in the individual EU Member States. However, this consequence cannot be excluded.
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Healthcare providers, physicians, distributors and third-party payors play a primary role in the distribution, recommendation and prescription of our products. Our arrangements with third-party payors and customers expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements through which we market, sell and distribute our products. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:

• | The United States federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending of any good or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretation and has been applied by government enforcement officials to a number of common business arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. The government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. There are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution; however, those exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute, but the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of the facts and circumstances. We seek to comply with the available statutory exemptions and safe harbors whenever possible, but our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants or patient or product assistance programs.

• | The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, or using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Private individuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” can bring civil False Claims Act qui tam actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals and may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in recovery or settlement. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly submitting false or misleading pricing information to government health care programs and providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Federal enforcement agencies also have showed increased interest in pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false claim or statement for violations. Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages and per claim penalties that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Companies may be required, however, to enter into corporate integrity agreements with the government, which may impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance. Criminal penalties, including imprisonment and criminal fines, are also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.

• | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, fraud provisions, among other things, impose criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. HIPAA also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.

• | The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value, directly or indirectly, to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year, and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year.

 Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payors, including private insurers or patients. Several states also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit
 certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers, and restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Some states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes.
 Legal Proceedings
 In July 2018, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed against us, our chief executive officer, our chief scientific officer and the underwriters of our July 2017 public offering, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint is brought on behalf of an alleged class of those who purchased our securities pursuant and/or traceable to our July and August 2017 public offering and those who purchased our securities between March 8, 2017 and February 13, 2018. The complaint purports to allege claims arising under Sections 10 and 20 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The complaint generally alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by, among other things, making material misstatements or omissions concerning IGNITE3. The complaint seeks, among other relief, unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The defendants have moved to transfer the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. We believe we have valid defenses against these claims, and will engage in a vigorous defense of such litigation.
