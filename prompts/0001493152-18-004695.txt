GTX provides a patented, comprehensive, end-to-end monitoring platform that provides tracking and monitoring services in vertical niche markets. We answer the “where is” question: such as, where is my mother, child, employee, pet, drone, rifle or high value asset. Through a proprietary IoT (“Internet of Things”) enterprise platform the Company offers a range of hardware, software and connectivity tracking and monitoring solutions and generates revenues through the sale of products and services, licensing and recurring subscriptions.
 
Since inception, GTX Corp has developed and commercially launched several products, including, our GPS Smart Shoes, SmartSoles, Bluetooth Low Energy (“BLE”) SmartSoles, hand-held GPS tracking devices, and more than 20 smartphone and tablet Apps, all supported by our hosted and scalable backend monitoring platform and intellectual property portfolio. The Company has four lines of business comprising of our core SmartSole line: Military, OEM and professional services, mobile work force, and intellectual property licensing. The business units generate various revenue streams, such as product sales, recurring subscriptions, software and intellectual property (IP) licensing, and fees for custom development and professional services. Our core products and services are supported by GTX’s IP portfolio of issued patents, licensed patents, patents pending, registered trademarks, copyrights, URLs and a library of proprietary hardware and software.
 
Our four primary business units are the following:
 

1) | Our core SmartSole line of wearable technology for people with cognitive memory disorders, such as Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism and traumatic brain injury (“TBI”). Typically, these people have a tendency to wander and require some wander guard technology and remote oversight. Approximately 9 million people in the US and over 100 million worldwide are affected. With the new biometric technology we plan to expand into the general senior population for people that need to track their mobility, activity and balance. Think of this as the FitBit for seniors market, with a potential customer base of 72 million people in the US and 650 million worldwide. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Military, OEM and custom development for tracking military personnel, high value assets, such as drones, small light weight cargo, rifles and other high value mobile assets that require our robust, small footprint and low power consumption hardware platform. 


3) | Mobile work force, such as salespersons, journalists, electricians, plumbers, food delivery, property management agents, cleaning services and other industries that require knowing the whereabouts of an employee or contractor in real tiAme but that don’t want to invest in costly GPS devices, instead would rather leverage a user’s smartphone. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) | IP licensing of some of our patents to further monetize the value of our IP. 

 
In 2014 after terminating a four-year licensing agreement for its GPS Smart Shoes, GTX took over the operations of product design, manufacturing, branding, marketing and sales and reset its business operations from a licensing model to a manufacturing and distribution model with the launch of the GPS SmartSole. GTX began to focus on building channels of distribution for its product lines of embedded smart wearable GPS devices, Stand-Alone GPS devices and Digital Apps which all funnel into the GTX Corp IoT monitoring platform. Each product line is sold both direct to consumer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) through a global network of resellers, affiliates, distributors, non-profit organizations, government agencies, police departments, manufacturers reps and retailers. The Company has been ramping up its product distribution and sales channels and, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had live units in the field and / or paying subscribers in over 35 countries, had 8 regional sales reps in the US, 6 retired and active professional athlete brand ambassadors, over 700 online affiliates, products being sold in 3 retail stores and 13 international distributors. Also, we have been issued a vendor number for reimbursement in 7 U.S. states and 2 countries (Canada and Sweden). We have also applied for other State and Federal reimbursement codes, grants and private insurance reimbursement along with other health and municipal services in several other countries. If granted, the reimbursements would lower the cost of acquiring and owning our tracking products, which could result in an increase in users of our SmartSole and Stand Alone devices. All product lines are sold with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription service plan or licensing fees ranging from $2.00 to $35.00 per month. In addition to product service fees the Company also generates revenues through platform and IP licensing fees.

In 2016, we commenced offering our products to the U.S. military for use in tracking military personnel and equipment and in September of 2017 we received our first military contract to supply custom designed GPS tracking equipment for Edwards Air Force Base. Under the AFB contract, GTX Corp will be responsible for the manufacturing, installation and ongoing maintenance and support of the Personnel, Equipment Tracking System (PETS) platform. We started delivering parts of the contract in the 4th quarter and will continue to ship throughout the first quarter of 2018. All of the hardware, software and firmware is being designed, manufactured and coded by the Company at its headquarters in Los Angeles, California. GTX is also designing the PCB boards in house in order to keep tight control of the entire design and manufacturing processes. Additional equipment and tools have been purchased in order to support in-house manufacturing and in preparation for developing future business with the military, GTX Corp has renewed and updated its System for Award Management (SAM) and General Services Administration (GSA) entity registrations and has begun preliminary conversations with other military bases in California, Nevada and Utah to explore their needs and requirements for similar tracking solutions. Orders from the military fall under our OEM and military business unit.
 
In 2016, we entered into a strategic IP agreement with Inventergy Innovations, LLC in order to maximize the licensing potential of certain of our key patents. Under this agreement, we assigned three of our key patents to Inventergy Innovations who, in turn, will either license these patents to third parties, enforce the patents against third parties, or otherwise monetize these IP assets. We have subsequently through our ongoing continuation patent filing process have been issued an additional patent in this family, now totalling four patents and adding to the overall value of this portfolio. We still maintain 100% of the rights to all our other patents in the shoe family and middle box family. During the 3rd quarter of 2017 Inventergy Innovations, LLC hired a highly experienced IP litigation law firm, Cotman IP Law Group in order to support our ongoing IP monetization and licensing efforts. In October of 2017 we amended our definitive agreement signed in June of 2016 reducing the quarterly draw from $25,000 to $12,500 in order to help support the legal fees associated with litigation, and we extended the licensing goals by nine (9) months pushing them forward to October 1, 2018 and July 1, 2020 to allow more time to for the legal litigation process. This is part of our IP monetization business unit.
 
In August of 2017 we entered into an agreement with Veristride, Inc., a company that specializes in wearable solutions to analyze gait movement at the source, using custom sensors at the foot and biomechanical analytics to provide feedback on how people walk, run and move. Gait technology is significant in fall risk detection and prevention, medication reaction, undetected stroke and early detection of dementia, Alzheimer’s or cognitive decline. More than 2.8 million falls are treated in emergency rooms annually in the U.S., accounting for an estimated $31 billion in direct medical costs. Being able to accurately monitor changes in gait/stride or activity levels specifically for seniors can have a major impact on their morbidity and mortality. Despite extensive preventive efforts, falling continues to be a major problem for seniors both at home and in community living facilities. Being able to accurately predict falls, strokes or early onset of dementia by wearing a smart non-intrusive footwear device can offer significant advancements in senior care and wellness. GTX has been exploring and evaluating gait technology for several years as the Company strongly believes that there are many benefits that arise from gait analysis. As part of the agreement GTX will be responsible for embedding this new technology in its line of SmartSoles, along with the manufacturing and distribution. The expansion into this market should increase our US senior target audience from the 6 million currently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s to the 72 million baby boomers in the US that may need or want their mobility, activity and gait monitored.
 
In 2017 the U.S. Patent and Trademark office allowed our fourth patent in our “286” family of patents. These four patents cover key aspects of our tracking technology but are not limited to any particular form factor and are applicable to any generic tracking device, which, in its simplest form includes a communication device (i.e. cell phone modem, blue tooth or Wi-Fi communicator), a location detector (i.e. GPS or Wi-Fi Module) and data memory. This technology is now commonly embedded in millions of devices and smartphones, deployed across numerous industries. In order to better monetize our IP, in June 2016, we signed an agreement with Inventergy Innovations, LLC (“Inventergy”), a subsidiary of Inventergy Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVT). In the third quarter of 2017 the LLC hired a highly experienced IP litigation law firm, Cotman IP Law Group in order to support our ongoing IP monetization and licensing efforts. The potential value of these 4 patents is that they extend beyond our core footwear patents and into areas such as GPS watches, fitness wearables that track location, hand-held GPS devices, tracking apps on Smartphones, standalone GPS tracking devices and location based platforms in general, which represents a very sizable addressable market. Due to the large size and scope of this market, the process of identifying potential licensee’s, formulating a strategy and the negotiations or litigation take a lot of time and resources, which is why the LLC hired the Cotman IP Law Group, a highly experienced IP litigation law firm. Cotman IP Law Group was hired in order to support our ongoing IP monetization and licensing efforts. In October of 2017 we amended our definitive agreement signed in June of 2016 with Inventergy reducing the quarterly draw from $25,000 to $12,500 in order to help support the legal fees associated with litigation and we extended the licensing goals by nine (9) months pushing them forward to October 1st 2018 and July 1st 2020 to allow more time to for the legal litigation process. Expenses related to the law firm will be shared between the parties and will ultimately come out of the gross proceeds. Due to the confidentiality nature of the negotiations and legal proceedings both current and in the future, the LLC or GTX will only be making announcements once agreements with licensees or judgements are definitive.

In addition to the four (4) comm protocol 286 family of patents, GTX also has several patents on the device side and has filed for patents on the server side. The three (3) pronged IP protection approach (device, communication and server) is part of the overall intellectual property strategy protecting all three aspects of the GTX enterprise and value proposition. Furthering its IP monetization strategy, GTX is also exploring licensing some of its other patents that are not part of the Invenergy LLC agreement.
 
In the third quarter of 2017, we received our first military contract to deliver a new proprietary non-cellular, encrypted GPS tracking devices named PETS for Personnel Equipment Tracking System. These new devices are being developed for large scale installations and bases that need to monitor the location and movement of every asset (both human and non-human) on that base, but due to the remote location of these bases and lack of conventional cellular coverage, the devices utilize RF technology and are in a hardened military grade encasement. We began delivering PETS devices in the 4th quarter of 2017 and continue to fulfil the contract which we expect to complete by end of Q1 2018. We have already received one subsequent order from the same base and have a meeting scheduled with another base which has shown interest in our proprietary asset and personnel tracking technology. We also began developing a GPS Rifle tracking device for Military and Law Enforcement. The first 10 prototypes were delivered in early Q1 2018 and are undergoing field testing. We have received numerous inquiries on this product from both domestic and international government agencies. This is still a very new program which involves large government institutions, which means it will take time to cultivate this business. However due to our small hardware footprint size, our core expertise in GPS tracking, being a current military contractor and our patent portfolio, we believe we are well positioned to capture additional orders for this emerging line of business. There are a lot of long guns in the U.S. and across the globe and there is a lot of talk right now on how to keep track of those guns.
 
On the domestic sales front, we upgraded our E-Commerce platform and online store, which went live in October 2017. In addition, we began working to setup an online store on Amazon, which went live in early 2018. We are slowly continuing to add more government disability assistance agencies and Police Departments, now across 10 States, which have implemented programs which order SmartSoles and provide full reimbursement for the families for both the product and the monthly service charges. This again is a slow process due to being government agencies, however we made a lot of progress in 2017 and now have in several of the 10 States more than one agency, department or field office per State buying from us, which means we are penetrating both horizontally across more Sates and vertically deeper within the same State.
 
On the research and development front we began several new projects throughout 2017. We developed and commercially launched the “SoleProtector,” a new product that allows the GPS SmartSole to be transferable from one person to another hygienically. In addition, the SoleProtectors cover logos or markings making the GPS SmartSoles more stealthy and discrete, plus adding some comfort and overall protection to the SmartSoles. We heard from numerous B2B customers and consumers asking for a product like this and as the Company plans to launch more wearable technology footwear, the SoleProtectors are a good high margin accessory product extension for us. We also began working on a CDMA version of the SmartSole to operate on the Verizon network throughout North America. Unfortunately, Verizon recently announced it would begin sun setting its 1XRTT network earlier than expected so we stopped our final testing phase and decided to not go into production with this product. We were expecting the network to be operational until 2020 and now Verizon has announced it would no longer accept new devices on this network starting in June of 2018. We still intend to launch a Verizon device in the future, most likely an LTE 4G device and continue to work with Verizon and Orbcomm on this longer term project. We also began the development of our 3G hardware Platform. We began shipping stand-alone 3G devices in the third quarter of 2017 and we began shipping 3G GPS SmartSoles in the first quarter 2018.

In August of 2017 we began the development of a smaller, lower cost hardware platform that is going to be used in our SmartSole line and OEM business. We received our first prototypes from China in December 2017, we are testing close to a dozen devices in the U.S. and across Europe with some of our distribution partners. The results so far are very positive and we expect to go into production sometime in the first half of 2018. These new electronics are smaller and embedded in the insole will enable us to offer a smaller size SmartSole expanding our women’s market and going into the kids market. Our production costs are expected to be 60% to 65% lower, which will bring down the wholesale and retail pricing allowing for bigger margins for GTX, our distributors and overall lower final price to the consumer or enterprise which should help generate more business. In addition the new electronics will have several new features such as Air Travel Mode, Speed Mode, a larger battery and rapid charging. All of which should contribute to more product sales. This new board which is called the MBLX will be for lower income markets and for individuals that are not “at risk” due to Alzheimer’s or autism, but rather for more of general population use. It will also be used in our OEM business unit for companies that are looking for a very small, low cost GPS / Cellular module they want to embed into their own form factor. We are testing the new boards embedded in SmartSoles with our channel partners in the US and Europe, and we are currently working with a few companies that are testing the new MBLX modules by themselves for OEM purchase. The OEM business is new for us and will take time to develop: however we are confident based on the preliminary testing so far that we will start seeing orders within the next few months. As for the new SmartSoles several of our distributors have already placed orders and are expecting to receive the first shipments post production. The lower cost and smaller size is allowing us to have far more conversations regarding, different markets, volume discounts and in markets that are very sensitive to pricing.
 
In August of 2017 the Company signed a collaboration agreement with Veristride, Inc., a company that specializes in gait movement and analysis using custom sensors at the foot and biomechanical analytics to provide feedback on how people walk, run and move. As mass numbers of Baby Boomers who need care begin to outnumber those able to help them, the need for research and technology solutions will continue to grow. The collaboration set out to develop and launch a suite of biometric solutions embedded in insoles with the primary goal of monitoring activity, mobility, balance and gait in order to analyse overall health and wellness along with being able to detect fall risk, which is a major problem for seniors. An estimated 2.8 million older people are treated in emergency departments for fall injuries each year. These fall injuries result in an estimated $31 billion in direct medical costs annually on an inflation-adjusted basis. Using custom sensors at the foot, the Biometric Insoles collect movement and activity data for gait analysis to provide better insight into fall risk detection and prevention for seniors. This product will expand GTX’s senior potential target audience from people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s to the 72 million baby boomers in the US and 650 million across the globe. This patented technology can also be used in other applications for younger adults that want to monitor daily activity, think of it as a nonvisible FitBit for the professional sports community and military. Management strongly believes that this technology placed in insoles will produce highly accurate and cost effective ways of detecting certain conditions. Under the agreement with Veristride, GTX will incorporate its inductive charging technology, enhance and miniaturize the electronics, develop a Low Energy Blue Tooth (BLE) gateway and embed the final hardware assembly into a SmartSole. The two companies also plan to explore having GTX do the commercial manufacturing of the products that are currently in development. The business value of analyzing walking patterns through gait technology is significant in fall risk detection and prediction of multi medication reaction, undetected stroke and early prediction of dementia. Being able to accurately monitor changes in gait/stride or activity levels specifically for seniors can have a major impact on their morbidity and mortality. Despite extensive preventive efforts, falling continues to be a major problem for seniors both at home and in community living facilities. Being able to accurately predict falls, strokes or early onset of dementia by wearing a smart non-intrusive footwear device can offer significant advancements in senior care and wellness. We completed our first porotypes in December 2017 and are currently testing both internally and with some of our partners. We expect to have one more hardware revision, perhaps one or two more backend software revisions and plan be ready to soft launch in the first half of 2018.
 
During 2017, the Company continued expanding its B2B sales channels internationally and domestically, testing product, exploring opportunities and signing up new distributors. Some of the countries included Japan, Hong Kong, Chile, Spain and the Middle East. Through our existing partnerships we also attended several large trade shows in the U.S. and Europe. We also hired additional account representatives to manage our reseller programs in the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean.
 
As the trend to use technological innovations to help seniors live longer more fulfilling lives continues to grow around the world (generally referred to as the Aging 2.0 movement), we continue to forge new strategic alliances. that will help us grow into the future. One such partner, George Mason University, completed the first phase of wandering predictive research utilizing the GTX IoT platform and data, and a two-stage spatiotemporal clustering algorithm which correctly predicted a users’ location 87% of the time. This high level of initial success in accurate wandering prediction has enabled George Mason University to file for a much larger phase II grant. The preliminary research will be made available to GTX Corp, which will consider deploying the prediction algorithms into our backend monitoring platform, adding another layer of technology and overall value to our IoT tracking platform and monitoring services.

The Company also partnered with TruSense which combines wireless sensors, Amazon Echo Dot and GPS Technology including GTX’s GPS SmartSole(r) to track daily activities, health patterns and variables, to address the needs of an entire family. This is GTX’s first entry into the Smart Home business and links the GPS SmartSoles with the Amazon voice activated Echo Dot. A TruSense user can ask Alexa where is grandma and receive a voice reply, “Grandma is at 117 W 9th St. in Los Angles California.”
 
The Company also formed a strategic alliance with HeartMath(r), Inc., an acknowledged world leader in stress and resilience technologies. Dr. Deborah Rozman, President of HeartMath Inc., has worked with thousands of health professionals, and hundreds of hospitals and clinics and through the partnership we created a health guide now available to the GPS SmartSole caregivers which are looking for tools that can help them cope with the physical, emotional and many times financial stress which comes from 24/7 caregiving. Since we specialize in solutions for people that have a caregiver in their life, we see this as another step forward in expanding our caregiver offerings and resources to empower both the caregivers and the patients to improve their health and well-being.

We continue to modify and upgrade our modules for our SmartSoles GPS tracking product to, among other things, make it available for use in various localities without customization. The production and roll-out of version 1.5 and 2.0 of our SmartSole product is expected to be a benefit because, unlike the earlier versions, we no longer have to custom make SmartSoles for our international distributors with their Sim cards, so our manufacturing cost and time lines are reduced and we have more flexibility to timely meet our customers’ requirements. Also we now are able to bill for data charges in over 100 countries, thereby increasing our potential markets. The ability to both produce a product that is able to be delivered to foreign market without customization and to bill for data charges in additional countries will enable us to increase our RPS (revenue per subscriber).
 
Global Trek Xploration has developed a “carrier-class” architecture and hosts the servers in a facility Data Center (reliable to 99.999%). The local service center runs on redundant off-the-shelf servers. This enables cost-efficient expansion, without the need for application code changes.
 
Our core tracking products (SmartSole, Take-Along-Tracker, OEM modules and Track my Work Force App) are supported by the existing infrastructure for the worldwide cell network that provides coverage throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and numerous other countries that operate on the global GSM Wireless networks. In addition, the personal locators will have the ability to operate on the networks of 290 carriers in over 210 countries.
 
Strategic Relationships and Licensing Arrangements
 
The main initiatives of Global Trek Xploration is to offer location based hardware and/or its IoT data monitoring platform to third parties for the sale and distribution of location based products/services in various markets. We begin the process by entering into a platform test agreement or pilot program with a potential partner with the intent to transition into a long-term relationship. By establishing and building partnerships, through licensing agreements, OEM, and carrier relationships, we facilitate efficient entry into new markets leveraging each company’s core competencies. We enhance the value of our distribution channels by aligning our sales and marketing efforts with strategic partners, including co-branding, distribution and marketing with telecommunication companies, wireless carriers, national retailers and major consumer branded companies.
 
Global Trek Xploration has the ability to customize its products to different form factors for the specific needs of its customers. To date, the Company has created three custom solutions: 1) the monitoring of seniors by installing the GPS device into specially designed shoes and insoles; 2) the monitoring of children by installing the GPS device into specially designed toys, belts, insoles and backpacks; and 3) the monitoring of various high value assets such as drones, long guns and other mobile assets.
 
The Company has several key strategic relationships established both on the supply side and the distribution side. Some of the key partners on the supply side are Atlantic Footcare, which manufactures our SmartSoles, Telic which manufactures our GPS and Cellular electronics, and Telefonica which provides our global connectivity. On the distribution side, we have numerous partnerships worldwide, ranging from distributors, health organizations, and retailers.

Our annual reports, quarterly reports, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and other information related to this Company, are available, free of charge, on our corporate website as soon as we electronically file those documents with, or otherwise furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s various Internet websites and the information contained therein, or connected thereto, are not, and are not intended, to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INVESTMENT
 
Since 2002, we have invested, and continue to invest, significantly in our intellectual property portfolio, which consist of patents, trademarks and URLs. We have an ongoing program to file additional applications for and to obtain patents in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Currently, we own 24 patents, many of which have priority dates going back to as early as 2002, with several in the footwear category and a majority covering other aspects of the personal locator technology. The IP also addresses our operating system and user interface. We also have several trademarks and acquired a license in 2011 for 62 external patents all in the field of geo – specific location based services.
THE INDUSTRY
 
It is now possible for a network of physical objects (humans, vehicles, buildings, infrastructure, equipment of all shapes and types) to collect and exchange data and to work together. This enables devices, sensors and systems to operate autonomously in pursuit of goals and objectives set by the human architects of the system. This has become known as The Internet of Things (IoT) and will drive radical change across multiple industries. While we all move towards an even more connected world, we believe that accurately identifying the location of a person or assets in real time will be a key driver in many wearable and IoT devices.
 
Smart technology is becoming the norm and it is starting to find its way into all parts of society. Miniature electronic devices that are worn by a person, commonly referred to as wearables, were a big and emerging part of the smart technology landscape for 2016 and is continuing on a strong upward trajectory in 2017. Wearable Technology is on the rise in personal fitness, wellness, healthcare and business use. CCS Insight recently updated its outlook on the future of wearable tech, indicating that 411 million smart wearable devices, worth a staggering $34 billion, will be sold in 2020.
 
The Caregiving Innovation Frontiers (CIF) study found that an estimated 117 million Americans will need assistance of some kind by 2020, but the number of unpaid caregivers is only expected to reach 45 million in the same year. We believe that these unpaid caregivers would benefit from solutions that assist them in locating and monitoring their elderly persons. This huge demand represents a $279 billion revenue opportunity over the next four years across six different business areas identified in the study, with 80% of spending being out-of-pocket costs. Technology solutions and remote health monitoring systems that enable family caregivers to monitor the location of elderly persons could provide key relief, according to the report. The CIF report outlined six areas for business opportunities, with huge potential for revenue grabs. Technology represents an opportunity across all the service areas, according to AARP. The majority of family caregivers—67% of them—want to use technology to monitor their loved one’s health and safety, but only about 10% are doing so right now, leaving a lot of room for growth.
 
In our ever-mobile society, it helps to know where we are and where we are going. Same with caregivers of seniors suffering from Alzheimer’s and dementia, freight forwarding companies wanting to know where their packages are, and employers want to know where their field workers are. Many parents desire to have the ability to know where their children are and where they are going. Having such information is now possible with access to real-time information delivered on-demand through miniaturized, low power consumption locator systems and technologies such as ours.

The rising need for two-way GPS and location based services is influenced by several factors, among them:
 

● | Universal awareness and expanding penetration of GPS enabled mobile smartphones & tablets (estimated 2 billion shipments worldwide in 2015). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Personal and asset security concerns affecting a greater portion of the population. This includes the increased awareness related to Global Terrorism and unrest. 
● | Increasing numbers of elderly or memory impaired (Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism, etc. 9 million in U.S. and growing to 277 million worldwide by 2050). 
● | Corporations needing to manage worker productivity and logistics. 
● | Government agencies, law enforcement and military personnel monitoring. 
● | Massive life style adoption of Location Based Social Networking. 

GROWTH STRATEGY
 
We are engaged in a three-prong business model; business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C) and licensing of our technology to other companies. Our initial focus it to provide personal monitoring and asset location products and services within specific niche markets. Once we hit critical mass in pricing, we will expand into the mass consumer markets. The strategy is to establish licensing relationships with key industry partners who will embed our technology into their products to sell to their established customer base. Key elements of our strategy include:

● | Providing our Personal Locator embedded module to licensees to empower their products with our two-way GPS tracking capabilities;

COMPETITION
 
Personal location and property tracking devices of various kinds are currently available from various vendors, and the number of competitive products is increasing rapidly in the marketplace. Furthermore, many of the location products and services are available at no cost to the user or are already included in other products. Nevertheless, we believe this rapidly growing market acceptance of the tracking solutions that we offer represents an opportunity as the intrinsic value of the tracking solutions is recognized and mass market adoption continues. The key competitive advantage for GTX in its lead SmartSole product is our innovative approach to embedding electronics inside a flexible footwear system, which advantage is protected by an extensive patent portfolio and first to market.
 
Key differentiators between ourselves and the competition is:
 
B2B:
 
● | Providing a comprehensive end-to-end solution comprised of hardware, software, and global connectivity, and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The ability to strategically align ourselves with partners to embed our technology through OEM or private label programs.
