ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Corporate History

On April 17, 2012, Mr. Vagner Gomes Tome, our former president, and sole director, incorporated the Company in the State of Nevada under the name Line Up Advertisement, Inc. On May 23, 2013, the Company accepted the resignation of Vagner Gomes Tome as the sole director and officer of the Company and appointed Joelyn Alcantara to serve in his stead. Thereafter, on April 25, 2017, Ms. Joelyn Alcantara resigned from all positions with the Company, including those of President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and Sole-Director. The resignation was not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies, or practices.

On April 25, 2017, Mr. Francisco Ariel Acosta was appointed as the sole member of the Company’s Board of Directors and as the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and Secretary.

On October 23, 2017, the Company closed on an Asset Acquisition Agreement (the “Original Agreement”) with Thomas Li, an individual and Nathan Xian, an individual (collectively Mr. Li and Mr. Xian are refereed to hereinafter as the “Inventors”). The Company purchased those assets owned by Inventors relating to Inventor’s development, sales, marketing, and distribution of Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (“UAV” or “Drones”) including but not limited to patents, trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, supply lists and other assets and intellectual property of any kind, relating directly or indirectly to the manufacturing, sales, and distribution of the Drones (the “Acquired Assets”). The Company was to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the Acquired Assets in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 60,000,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock (“TACC Shares”) to the Inventors (the “Purchase Price”).

Additionally, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Original Agreement, the following changes to the Management of the Company occurred:


· | As of October 23, 2017, Francisco Ariel Acosta resigned from all positions with the Company, including but not limited to those of President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Director.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | As of October 23, 20017, Thomas Li was appointed a member of the Company’s Board of Directors and as the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer. 
· | As of October 23, 20017, Nathan Xian was appointed a member of the Company’s Board of Directors and Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. 


On October 4, 2017, the Company changed its name from Line Up Advertisement, Inc. to Tactical Services, Inc. to reflect the new business direction of the Company.

However, on August 24, 2018, the Company and the Inventors entered into a Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), terminating the Original Agreement. The Termination Agreement was the direct result of a material breach of the terms and conditions of the Original Agreement. Specifically, the Inventors, pursuant to Section 2.01 of the Original Agreement, were to “sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver…” various assets to the Company. As of the date thereof, the Inventors were unsuccessful in fulfilling their obligations under the terms and conditions of the Original Agreement. The effect of the Termination Agreement was that the Original Agreement was rendered null and void and of no legal effect whatsoever, without any liability or obligation on the part of the parties to the Original Agreement.

Accordingly, Mr. Li and Mr. Xian resigned from all positions with the Company effective as of August 24, 2018, and Mr. Francisco Ariel Acosta was re-appointed as the sole member of the Company’s Board of Directors and as the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and Secretary.
