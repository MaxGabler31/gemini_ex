Item 1. Business.
Overview



We are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. While our efforts to identify a target business may span many industries and regions worldwide, since our initial public offering, we have focused our search for prospects within the insurance industry as described below. Our ability to locate a potential target is subject to the uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Report.
Initial Public Offering



On December 15, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering of 20,125,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, and one-half of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $201,250,000.



Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 632,500 units to our sponsor, DIAC Sponsor LLC, at a purchase price of $10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $6,325,000.



A total of $201,250,000, comprised of $197,225,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering (which amount includes $7,043,750 of the underwriter’s deferred discount) and $4,025,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement units, was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.



Our management team is led by Andrew J. Poole, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Bryce Quin, our Chief Financial Officer, who have many years of experience investing in ventures and building companies with operations. We must complete our initial business combination by June 15, 2022, 18 months from the closing of the initial public offering. If our initial business combination is not consummated by June 15, 2022, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.



FOXO Transaction 



On February 24, 2022, we entered into the FOXO Transaction Agreement with FOXO and certain other parties. Pursuant to the FOXO Transaction Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, a Delaware subsidiary of our Company will merge with and into FOXO, with FOXO surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company.



In connection with the FOXO Transaction Agreement, we entered into several ancillary agreements, including:




● | the Purchase Agreement with Cantor. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Combined Company (as defined therein) after the closing of the FOXO Transaction Agreement has the right from time to time to sell to Cantor up to $40 million in shares of its Class A common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including, without limitation, the effectiveness of a registration statement covering the shares. As consideration for Cantor’s commitment to purchase the shares of Class A Common Stock, we will issue $1,600,000 of our Class A common stock to Cantor after the consummation of the Merger (as defined therein). We will reimburse up to $75,000 of Cantor’s legal fees and $25,000 per fiscal quarter in connection with Cantor’s ongoing diligence.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | the Backstop Subscription Agreements with the Backstop Investors, pursuant to which, in the event that, at the Closing (as defined in the FOXO Transaction Agreement), we have cash or cash equivalents of less than $10,000,000, the Backstop Investors will subscribe for up to 1,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth therein. 




In connection with the proposed FOXO Transaction, we will file the FOXO Registration Statement, which will include a (i) prospectus with respect to our securities to be issued in connection with the FOXO Transaction and (ii) proxy statement, to be used at the meeting of our stockholders to approve the proposed merger and related matters. You should review both the FOXO Registration Statement and FOXO Proxy Statement, any amendments thereto, and other relevant documents that will be filed with the SEC for additional information regarding the FOXO Transaction Agreement, the FOXO Transaction and FOXO, including the risks and uncertainties regarding the FOXO Transaction and FOXO’s business.



The foregoing descriptions of the FOXO Transaction Agreement and Purchase Agreement are subject to and qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the FOXO Transaction Agreement, Purchase Agreement and Backstop Subscription Agreements, copies of which are attached as exhibits to the Report. Other than as specifically discussed, this Report does not give effect to the proposed FOXO Transaction.

Initial Business Combination



We intend to efficiently identify and complete an initial business combination within the insurance technology, traditional insurance and insurance-related products and services industries, which we refer to as the insurance and insurtech sector. However, we are not limited to these industries and we may pursue a business combination opportunity in any business or industry we choose and we may pursue a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States. Our management team and executive advisors include insurance and insurtech sector executives and investors well positioned to draw upon a vast network across the insurance and insurtech sector to identify opportunities that have the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. The insurance industry is rapidly changing through the use of new technology led by innovative insurtech companies. We believe these changes have accelerated in a post COVID-19 environment as technology is playing an increasingly important role in the insurance value chain. Our immediate focus is on those companies leading innovation in their respective markets and partnering with thought leaders utilizing technology to enhance their operational goals. Our management team and executive advisors are experienced at identifying insurtech, traditional insurance and insurance-related product and service assets in addition to creating strategies to enhance those assets so that they reach their full market potential. Not only do our management team and executive advisors bring a combination of operating, investing, financial and transaction experience, but also has extensive governance, regulatory and public company leadership experience creating value for stockholders and policyholders. Their deal sourcing network, ranging from industry executives, private owners, private equity funds, and investment bankers will enable us to pursue a broad range of opportunities across the entire insurance and insurtech sector. We believe that our ability to source, evaluate and execute value enhancing strategies for businesses within the insurance and insurtech sector are highly differentiated and will lead to superior risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders.



We broadly define the insurance sector to include, but not be limited to:




● | Insurance technology, or insurtech, companies focused on utilizing technology across the insurance value chain. These companies may include, but are not limited to, insurtech companies focused on accessing underpenetrated markets, improving insurance operational efficiencies, risk selection processes and claims processes by utilizing innovative technologies to broadly improve the sector;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Insurance carriers, including property-casualty, life, health, title, mortgage and reinsurance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Insurance distribution companies, including retail agents, insurance brokers, managing general agents, managing general underwriters and other insurance intermediaries; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Industry service providers, including claims or medical cost management, software, data and technology providers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe that the insurance sector is highly fragmented presenting us with a number of value creation opportunities. We believe we are positioned to provide growth capital to these companies to take advantage of rapidly improving market conditions. Our growth equity and expertise also provide a solution for industry participants positioned to capitalize on a confluence of industry-specific factors contributing to financial and operational pressures in the sector. Our differentiated capital solution for the insurance sector positions us to meet emerging trends including:




● | Onset of insurtech and traditional companies harnessing software alongside other forms of technology and driving an increased importance of data including:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Greater focus on how data improves segmentation, pricing and reserving generally;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The internet of things (“IOT”) driving the ability to analyze real-time risk taking behavior at home, on the road and at work potentially driving loss ratios lower over time;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilizing artificial intelligence (“AI”) to process claims and back office tasks with lower costs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opening up new industry distribution processes and avenues affecting brokers, agents and underwriters;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Emergence of a hard commercial underwriting market which will drive outsized, and in some cases, extreme growth for companies providing or underwriting commercial products who have access to capital over the next few years;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Recent catastrophic events including losses associated with COVID-19, arguably the largest loss to the insurance and insurtech sector in history, leading to meaningful balance sheet stress and demonstrating the importance of technology to operational excellence;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Low interest rate environment, negatively impacting returns on invested capital and driving the need for enhanced underwriting profits;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing competition, often from larger entities, decreasing underwriting margins and limiting revenue growth;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Weakening of balance sheets in part driven by years of deteriorating industry results and (social) inflation worries resulting in lower distributions to owners;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Alternative capital continuing to permeate the industry disintermediating portions of the underwriting apparatus;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expensive intermediary structure facing pressure to remain competitive; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broker consolidation driving further economics away from underwriters.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Management Team



Our management team is led by Andrew J. Poole, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, and is supported by our Chief Financial Officer and our accomplished board of directors who are recognized experts in the insurance sector. Mr. Poole’s career has been centered on generating attractive risk-adjusted returns as a manager of capital at various hedge funds with a focus, in part, on analyzing and valuing the entire capital structure of public insurance companies. He has over 18 years of diversified investment experience and possesses an in depth understanding of insurance markets, financial markets and economics. Mr. Poole was the Chief Investment Officer of Tiberius Acquisition Corporation (Nasdaq: TIBR), or Tiberius, a blank check company which went public in March 2018 with $174.225 million held in trust and which consummated its initial business combination with International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. (Nasdaq: IGIC), or IGI, an international specialty insurance and reinsurance group registered in Bermuda, in March 2020, on the day after the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, (which tracks the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500) closed at a record high. Upon the closing of Tiberius’ business combination, Mr. Poole joined the board of IGI. Concurrently, he was and remains an investment consultant at The Gray Insurance Company. Mr. Poole’s most recent role prior to joining Tiberius and The Gray Insurance Company was as a Partner and Portfolio Manager at Scoria Capital Partners, LP, a long/short equity hedge fund, where he managed a portion of the firm’s capital including insurance sector investments. Prior to Scoria, Mr. Poole held various positions at Diamondback Capital Management (including Portfolio Manager) and SAC Capital, both multi-strategy multi-manager cross capital structure long/short hedge funds. Mr. Poole started his career at Swiss Re (SIX: SREN) working in facultative property placements and was previously on the board of Family Security, a personal lines insurance company, prior to the sale of the company to United Insurance Holdings Corporation (Nasdaq: UIHC).



Bryce Quin, CPA, our Chief Financial Officer, has over 15 years of diversified operational experience in the insurance industry. Mr. Quin was the Chief Financial Officer of Tiberius from its initial public offering through the consummation of its initial business combination with IGI. Concurrently, he served as a Process Improvement Specialist for The Gray Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Gray & Company, where he started his career and obtained his CPA designation. Prior to this he was Accounting Manager for The Gray Insurance Company working as a direct report to the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and prior to that he held various roles of increasing responsibility. Previously, Mr. Quin was Accountant and Systems Administrator for Delta Title, a subsidiary of Gray & Company. He has been a member of the Gray & Company Investment Committee since its inception. As a result, Mr. Quin has experience analyzing investment opportunities in the insurance industry, the oil and gas sector, and commercial property development. Mr. Quin is a current member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.



Past performance of our management team and executive advisors does not guarantee either (i) success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. You should not rely on the historical performance record of our management team or executive advisors as indicative of our future performance. In addition, our executive officers and directors may have conflicts of interest with other entities to which they owe fiduciary or contractual obligations with respect to initial business combination opportunities.



Business Strategy and Deal Origination



We believe that the insurance sector is highly fragmented and evolving quickly, with hundreds of private companies facing a confluence of insurance industry-specific factors contributing to ever increasing financial and operational pressures. Our acquisition and value creation strategy will be to identify and acquire a business in the insurance sector and, after our initial business combination, enhance the stockholder returns for such business utilizing the expertise of our management team and executive advisors, who are recognized experts in the insurance sector. Our business combination strategy will leverage the following attributes of our management team and executive advisors:

● | Broad network, proprietary contacts, corporate relationships (including financing providers and investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banks, accounting firms, target management teams and companies or individuals that represent sellers) and industry experience of our management team and executive advisors developed through extensive experience in investing, operating, marketing and growing businesses in the insurance industry;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to enact positive transformation, attractive revenue and relationship growth, operational enhancements and efficiencies to grow stockholder value pre and post business combination closing including enhancement of tangible book value growth per share for underwriters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Augmentation capabilities surrounding capital stewardship efforts and optimization of the balance sheet; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Investing (including investment portfolio enhancement on a risk-adjusted basis), financial and transaction expertise coupled with governance, regulatory and research procurement skills deployed to the benefit of the business combination target.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Our management team and executive advisors will liaise with their networks of relationships to articulate our potential business combination target search parameters and commence the pursuit and diligence of prospective leads.



Acquisition Criteria



Our intent is to seek potential target businesses globally. The maturity and judgment of our management team and executive advisors will guide our acquisition process. When potential targets are being evaluated, we have used and will continue to use the following, non-exclusive criteria listed below for determining opportunities. We will use these criteria when evaluating business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet all or some of these criteria:

● | Businesses that will offer the most attractive risk-adjusted returns for our warrant holders and stockholders;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Businesses that are leading underwriting and claims innovation and opening up new distribution processes in their respective markets through an increased deployment of data and new technologies including IOT and AI while partnering with thought leaders to enhance their operational goals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Businesses that have market leadership positions in their respective segment of the insurance sector and would benefit from our extensive networks, insights and ability to enhance stockholder value going forward;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Businesses that provide or underwrite products, content or services, with the potential for meaningful benefits and growth going forward from the hard commercial market;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Businesses that are fundamentally sound but are underperforming their potential, can benefit from our ability to enhance stockholder value, and offer compelling value;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Businesses that offer the opportunity for our management team and executive advisors to partner with target management teams or business owners to achieve long-term strategic and operational excellence; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Businesses that can utilize our capital to solve for the insurance industry-specific factors described above contributing to ever increasing financial and operational pressures and opportunities driving the need for strategic alternatives and access to capital including the onset of insurtech companies harnessing software alongside other forms of technology to drive an increased importance of data.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team and executive advisors may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.



We may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination. We intend to acquire a business with an enterprise value significantly above the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units. Depending on the size of the transaction or the number of public shares we become obligated to redeem, we may potentially utilize several additional financing sources, including but not limited to the issuance of additional securities to the sellers of a target business, debt issued by banks or other lenders or the owners of the target, a private placement to raise additional funds, or a combination of the foregoing. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient to meet our obligations or our working capital needs, we may need to obtain additional financing.

Initial Business Combination



NYSE rules require that we must complete our initial business combination with one or more businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects.



We will structure our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target business or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.



We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



Our Business Combination Process



In evaluating prospective business combinations, we will conduct a thorough due diligence review process that may encompass, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management team and advisors (if applicable), on-site inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate. We will also utilize the expertise of our management team and executive advisors in public security valuation, analyzing insurance companies and evaluating operating projections, financial projections and determining the appropriate return expectations given the risk profile of the target business.



Following the announcement of our initial business combination, we intend to evaluate opportunities to enhance stockholder value including, but not limited to, maximizing tangible book value per share or EBITDA growth and developing and implementing corporate initiatives to improve risk-adjusted warrant and common stockholder returns. In doing so, the management team anticipates evaluating corporate governance, opportunistically accessing capital markets, procuring publicly accessible investor research on the business combination and other opportunities to enhance liquidity, identifying acquisition and divestiture opportunities, and properly aligning management and board incentives with the appropriate metrics that public company investors use to track stockholder value growth.




5







Potential Conflicts of Interest



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view.



Members of our management team and our independent directors directly and indirectly own founder shares and/or placement units and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.



Certain of our officers and directors presently have fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer, and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.



Members of our management team may become an officer or director of another special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act even before we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination.



Status as a Public Company



We believe our structure as a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As a public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. A target business can further benefit by augmenting its profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers.



Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an initial business combination with us.



Furthermore, once a proposed initial business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.




6







While we believe that our structure and our management team’s and executive advisors’ backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, and accordingly our lack of operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of the year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s fiscal quarter.



Financial Position



With funds available for an initial business combination, currently in the amount of $194,235,174 as of December 31, 2021 (excluding deferred compensation payable to underwriters in our initial public offering), we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We will effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the of the placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to backstop agreements which we may enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.




7







We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts raised in our initial public offering and held in the trust account. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.



Sources of Target Businesses



Target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses which may be of interest to us on an unsolicited basis, given such sources will have read this Report and know the types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our sponsor and its affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as by means of trade shows or conventions.



In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our sponsor and its affiliates. We may also engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a business combination transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will any of our existing officers or directors be paid any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the Company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have agreed to pay our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination candidate.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors or making the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.



In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our Chief Executive Officer, and the success of Tiberius, which is well-known to many market participants. Potential target companies with whom we may engage in discussions after the closing of the offering may have had prior discussions with other blank check companies, bankers in the industry and/or other professional advisors including blank check companies with which our executive officers or directors were affiliated. We may pursue transactions with such potential targets (i) if such other blank check companies are no longer pursuing transactions with such potential targets, (ii) if we become aware that such potential targets are interested in a potential initial business combination with us and (iii) if we believe such transactions would be attractive to our stockholders. We have not contacted any of the prospective target businesses that Tiberius had considered and rejected while it was a blank check company searching for target businesses with which to consummate an initial business combination. However, we may contact such targets if we become aware that such targets are interested in a potential initial business combination with us and such transaction would be attractive to our stockholders.

If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination



NYSE rules require that we must complete our initial business combination with one or more businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.



In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% fair market value test.



To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



In evaluating a prospective business target, we will conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.



Lack of Business Diversification



For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we are focusing our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team



Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.



Following an initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees



We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary, in the exercise of their respective business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We have one full time employee, a managing director, who began working with the Company in June 2021. We do not have an employment agreement with any member of our management team or any of our executive advisors.

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.



We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.



We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. Prior to the date of this prospectus, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
