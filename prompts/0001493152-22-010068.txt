ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Corporate History and General Information
 
NEXT-ChemX Corporation formerly known as AllyMe Group, Inc. was organized on August 13, 2014, as a Nevada corporation under Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. The Company’s principal office is located at 1111 W 12th Street, #113, Austin, TX. 78703.
 
During the 2021 financial year, and specifically on April 27, 2021, certain major changes were undertaken by the Company that have resulted in a change in the business, management, focus and long term strategy of the Company. Prior to April 27, 2021 the Company provided management services and consulting, however, the business was in decline for some time resulting in discontinuation of its business. From April 27, 2021 the business of the Company moving forward is to bring to market a certain novel extraction technology as further described below. The change of name, management and the Company’s primary assets underlines these fundamental changes to the Business.
 
Effective April 27, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), the Company, entered into that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with NEXT-ChemX Corporation, a private Texas company (“NEXT-ChemX”), in which the Company acquired certain intellectual property assets of NEXT-ChemX, specifically certain patents and patent applications, in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 23,844,448 shares of common stock of the Company (the “APA Issuance”).
 
On April 27, 2021, the previous sole officer and director of the company, Zicheng Wang, resigned his positions with the Company. Upon such resignation Benton Wilcoxon was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board, and J. Michael Johnson was appointed President, Treasurer and Secretary, and Director of the Company.
 
The Company qualifies as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act which became law in April 2012. The definition of an “emerging growth company” is a company with an initial public offering of common equity securities which occurred after December 8, 2011, and has less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during last completed fiscal year.
 
Overview of the Business
 
The Company was originally formed to provide consulting services in China principally focused on the development of new-high-tech products marketing and retail sales using the name WeWin Group Corp this was changed, in December 2018, with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) approval, to AllyMe Group, Inc. without any change to the then trading symbol (“WWIN”).
 
On April 27, 2021, the Company acquired intellectual property assets from NEXT-ChemX Corporation, a private Texas corporation (“NEXT-ChemX TX”), including its patents and patent applications, related to a novel membrane-based ion extraction process (“Membrane Extraction Technology”), which is able to extract ions exiting in low concentrations from liquid solutions. It can be used to extract lithium from brine solutions, to extract fatty acids from vegetable oils as a superior refining process, to extract radioactive ions from nuclear waste waters, to extract specific metal ions from mining leach solutions and waste effluent, and to remove ions from seawater for desalination, among other things.
 
The Membrane Extraction Technology is the principal asset of the business. Membrane Extraction Technology is an Ion Extraction Technology based upon unique chemistry: by using the very high surface area of special “Hollow Fiber Membranes” we have proven the Membrane Extraction Technology to achieve the most effective extraction rates of ions existing in low concentrations in liquids. The Membrane Extraction Technology represents a radical new commercial approach to extraction technique. Rather than harnessing the osmotic process or sophisticated filtration techniques, electrolysis or simple evaporation, our Membrane Extraction Technology mimics nature’s biophysical processes. In effect, by using these natural principals we have developed and, during 2021, proven the Company’s ability to extract ions from a liquid solution at ambient temperatures and pressures even where ions exist in low concentrations.
 
Nature has evolved very efficient processes to extract ions from solutions and much of higher life biology is based on these principals. As a result, our Membrane Extraction Technology is effective and efficient without using high pressures, high temperatures, or electrolysis. In contrast to existing methods, our Membrane Extraction Technology uses very little energy, does not disrupt the balance of the natural water cycle through wide scale evaporation and only extracts what is targeted and generates much less waste. Sustainable processes are those that do not disrupt the natural cycles when they operate to make change and do not deplete finite resources to drive their process; we believe that by only removing specific ions from targeted solutions leaving the remaining solution unchanged, we provide a sustainable and “surgical” means of concentrating materials from solutions, refining and improving liquids and oils and cleaning or decontaminating the environment.

During the course of 2021 and into 2022, we have been and continue to adapt our extraction technology to specific ions. Given the wide area of application of the Membrane Extraction Technology, the Company plans to focus on certain core target areas before turning to other sectors. These are:
 

● | Lithium Extraction from Natural Brines, Geothermal Wells, or Leach Solutions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Extracting Fatty Acids from Vegetable Oils for More Economical Refining; and 
● | Extracting of Radioactive Ions from Nuclear Plant Stored Water. 

 
In particular we have targeted the extraction of lithium from naturally occurring brines and geothermal sources. In the design of our lithium extraction process, we have developed a system for extracting many of the valuable naturally occurring additional ions in the solutions that yield lithium. We believe that this approach to isolating different elements during extraction will yield potential additional revenues or improve the environment by reducing or eliminating unwanted ions including contamination. The resulting process will generate better more efficient extraction with the minimal disruption to the environment. Moreover, most of the water resources can be returned to the aquifers or lakes from which they were drawn. In 2021, we began a process of collaboration and hiring of experts to focus on the design and engineering of our own Hollow Fiber Membranes. Work is underway and will continue through 2022 to engineer commercially operating Modules containing optimized surface area square meterage to give the most efficient extraction for targeted ions. We plan to supply scalable Extraction Plants in 40’ containers which have an optimal number of modules for each process. These container systems will be located at the customer extraction sites. Our revenue model is to provide the extraction service for either a tolling fee or under a cost savings revenue sharing model.
 
The Company is pursuing an aggressive intellectual property protection strategy. The Company has engaged the Navitas Intellectual Property Group LLC of Denver, Colorado for its international intellectual property requirements. This group is headed by Michael D. McIntosh and David F. Dockery, both highly specialized chemical processing and material science patent attorneys. Navitas is working closely with the Company’s research and development team to identify processing, materials and markets to pursue patent protection. In turn, Navitas works with the Company’s management to identify regions of the world to pursue desired protection. In 2021 the Company filed for patent protection for novel aspects of its Lithium recovery developments. Additional patent applications are currently in progress dealing with oil purification, further aspects of Lithium processing and recovery, metals recycling and other developments. Company is also focusing on novel membrane characteristics, production and uses. Details of these applications are confidential until published pursuant to international patent publication requirements.
 
In mid-June of 2021, the Company opened its development facility in Illinois under the direction of the inventing scientist of our Membrane Extraction Technology. At this laboratory facility, lab equipment was acquired, and chemical engineers were recruited to set up laboratory test systems to extract certain elements, such as low concentrations of lithium from liquids. The testing allowed us to determine preliminary dynamics of extraction to support the preparation of additional intellectual property protection strategy. Minimal necessary laboratory equipment was acquired due to our modest financial capabilities as well as various hollow fiber modules to test which commercially available hollow fiber membranes in packages modules would work with our process.
 
Lithium Extraction
 
After some months testing, the successful extraction of lithium it was determined we should use a custom hollow fiber to achieve better results. In Q4 of 2021, we began the design and production of custom made hollow fibers and testing was successful. The results exceed our original projections.
 
Looking forward to 2022, the Company plans to set up its own production of proprietary custom hollow fibers as well as a customizing the packaging into specially designed modules for our unique applications. This strategy will be pursued as a primary goal through 2022.
 
Vegetable Oil Refining.
 
In September and through Q4 of 2021, successful testing was done on the removal of fatty acids from vegetable oils as well as various glycerides that are present in biodiesels which are difficult to remove. The Company has already received expressions of interest in this new technology for extraction, in a market where conventional methods are often environmentally unfriendly and inefficient, resulting in higher production costs.

Removal of Radioactive Contamination:
 
In 2021 discussions were held in Ukraine to secure materials at a controlled location to test the extraction of radioactive ions stored as liquids from nuclear plants. This plan is currently suspended due to the current invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces.
 
Essential to the success of the commercialization process is the hiring of a successful management team. During the course of 2021 and subsequently, we have added certain key expertise to the central management team as well as to the staff of the organization. This process will continue during 2022 as the Company anticipates adding a new facility for the finalization of the manufacturing process for the commercial customer trial plants and commercial deployment.
 
The general process of commercialization of any physically embodied technology from its theoretical proposal to its successful commercialization can be described as follows: initially the technology must be demonstrated as novel and viable; this is usually done in a laboratory and demonstrates its practical application. At the end of this process, the technology can be said to be proven. Once proven, laboratory pilot plants or systems are developed to prove and measure the operational capabilities, documenting process variations and the effects of adjustments and modifications. Process control systems are introduced and quality measurement points and processes are developed. At this stage, the process kinetics are examined in depth, and variables are identified and documented with process controls and modifiers defined. In addition, initial commercial cost and operational data is collected to finalize a proposed commercial viability analysis. Practical testing is done preferably with some customer materials and involvement. From laboratory pilot we will move to commercial pilot plant. This involves using the laboratory pilot to design the most efficient system for commercial deployment and testing. Real-world efficiencies are measured and parameters adjusted to deployed operational conditions. Commercial data is collected to finalize the commercialization model. The final phase is commercial deployment.
 
In this process it is difficult to identify the time taken to move from one phase to another and the phases are not always clear cut. There is no defined moment at which one invests in a new phase of development and this is usually a matter of judgement influenced by pressure to bring the product to market, funding, competition, staff expertise and numerous other factors. This makes it critical to have a good management team that is incentivized and motivated.
 
In the Company’s estimation, as at December 31, 2021 our Membrane Extraction Technology is a proven technology and we are well into the Laboratory Pilot phase. We have proven the extraction rates, and the ability of the Membrane Extraction Technology to operate effectively. We have added expertise in pilot plant design and configuration as well as in the development of hollow fiber membranes. We anticipate that we will complete the Laboratory Pilot phase and move to commercial testing during the course of 2022.
 
The Company is currently in the early stages of its development and there is no guarantee that it will be successful at any time in the near future or ever.
 
Initial Company Funding
 
Prior to the conclusion of the April 27, 2021 Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company’s funding was provided by equity investment by certain parties resident in China and on a loan basis by related parties and customers and through the sales of Company stock in China.
 
Since the refocus of the Company’s business following April 27, 2021, the Company has raised $587,500 from a total of 13 investors by issuing a one year convertible note paying 8% interest payable on expiry or conversion of the notes; these notes, and their interest if so elected, are convertible into common stock at $0.75 per share. This issuance closed on November 11, 2021 with a Regulation D filing.
 
Additionally, $85,000 was raised in the 4th quarter 2021 through the issuance of convertible notes on the same terms, except that the principal and interest are convertible into common stock at $1.00.
 
One member of the management team provided loans of $23,900 as promissory notes. When due, the interest on the notes was waived; one note for US$3,000 was repaid and one note for $15,000 was converted into a convertible note on the same terms as the other convertible notes, but with the principal and interest convertible into common stock at $1.00. Of the remaining 2 promissory notes, one for $2,500 pays interest at 5% and the second for $3,400 pays no interest. It is anticipated that these notes will be repaid in 2022.

Funding has been utilized to acquire of certain critical equipment and testing materials, as well as to cover the general and administrative expenses of the Company (primarily associated with being a US reporting company) and to provide working capital.
 
Capital Formation
 
NEXT-ChemX Corporation Shareholders Equity Capital Formation.
 
Events prior to April 27, 2021
 
The Company was formed on August 13, 2014, with no capital. Thereafter, on November 5, 2015, the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of founder’s capital to Gulmira Makhutova at $0.001 per share for an aggregate of $6,000. In the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued an additional 2,620,000 shares of its common stock to 29 shareholders at $0.01 per share for total proceeds of $26,200.
 
On July 17, 2018 Zilin Wang purchased 8,618,000 shares of Company Common Stock from Yonghua Kang (as representative of the seller). The shares purchased in this transaction represented 99.98% of the then issued and outstanding shares of the Company.
 
In September 2018, the Company sold an additional 212,060 shares of Company Common Stock to 44 Chinese investors at prices ranging from $0.05 per share to $1.00 per share. This offering netted proceeds of $23,770. These shares were not physically issued until October 8, 2018.
 
In December 2018, the Company sold an additional 112,000 shares of Company Common Stock to 16 Chinese investors at prices ranging from $0.05 to $1.00 per share for total proceeds of $59,500. These shares were issued on December 28, 2018. 40,000 of these shares were issued under the Company’s 2018 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Plan and were registered on Form S-8.
 
In 2019, the Company sold an additional 12,131 shares of Company Common Stock to a third party at an average price of $1.88 per share.
 
In 2020, the Company sold an additional 2,798 shares of Company Common Stock to a third party at an average price of $1.10 per share.
 
Events on and after April 27, 2021
 
As at April 27, 2021, the Company had 8,958,989 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. On that date, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, Zilin Wang, the then majority shareholder of the Company, sold 8,618,000 shares of common stock of the Company representing 96.2% of the outstanding shares, to Arastou Mahjoory and Kenneth Mollicone, each an accredited investor, in equal parts. In support of that transaction, Messrs. Mahjoory and Mollicone also entered into stock purchase Agreements with several minority shareholders to acquire an additional 322,989 shares of common stock of the Company. These minority shareholders together held an additional 3.61% of the common stock of the Company prior to April 27, 2021.
 
Following the sale of shares by Zilin Wang to Messrs. Mahjoory and Mollicone, cancelled an aggregate of 5,418,000 shares of common stock of the Company.
 
Additionally, effective April 27, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with NEXT-ChemX Corporation, a private Texas company (“NEXT-ChemX”), in which the Company acquired certain intellectual property assets of NEXT-ChemX, specifically certain patents and patent applications, in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 23,844,448 shares of common stock of the Company (the “APA Issuance”).

Also effective from April 27, 2021, the previous sole officer and director of the company, Zicheng Wang, resigned his positions with the Company. Upon such resignation the shareholders appointed Benton Wilcoxon as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and J. Michael Johnson as President, Treasurer and Secretary, and as a director of the Company.
 
As of December 31, 2021, an aggregate of 27,385,437 shares are issued and outstanding. This reflects the APA Issuance, which results in NEXT-ChemX holding approximately 87.07% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company. As such NEXT-ChemX is able to unilaterally control the election of our board of directors, all matters upon which shareholder approval is required and, ultimately, the direction of our Company. Also, after giving effect to the acquisition and cancellation of shares by Messrs. Mahjoory and Mollicone will each hold 6.44% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock in the Company.
 
During the course of 2021, the Company raised a total of $687,500 from the issuance of a total of 16 convertible notes each paying an annual interest of 8% and due or convertible in 12 months. Interest on all the notes is due or convertible into shares at the end of the note period. As at December 31, 2021 a total of $22,767 of interest had accumulated on these notes. All the notes were issued to private individuals including one issued to a related party member of management. The conversion rate for the first 13 notes issued in 2021 was fixed at $0.75. The final 3 conversion notes were issued with an increased conversion rate of $1.00. In the event that all the convertible notes were converted at their rates of conversion, this would lead to an additional 883,338 shares issued. If the interest payments due at the end of the note term was all converted this will lead to a further issuance of 70, 626 shares.
 
During the course of 2021, the Company has not been operating with sufficient funds. This has resulted in the management team deferring the payment of salary and there being inadequate resources to pursue the opportunity presented by the Membrane Extraction Technology at optimal speed. Following December 31, 2021, the Company will require additional funding for ongoing operations and to complete its program as planned. There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any additional capital and as of December 31, 2021 the Company had no current arrangements for any such financing.
 
Risks and Uncertainties Facing the Company
 
No Revenues:
 
Since the changes to the business that resulted from the April 27, 2021 Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company has had no revenues which have been derived from its business.
 
As an early-stage company, the Company expects to experience losses in the near term. The Company needs to generate revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to identify sufficient numbers of customers to generate enough revenues to continue operations or proceed with developing its business in accordance with its business plan.
 
One of the biggest challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to fund its projects, including securing adequate capital to pay for operations and hiring service providers. Secondarily, a major challenge will be implementing effective sales and marketing strategies to reach the intended end customers. The Company has considered and devised its initial sales, marketing and advertising strategy; however, the Company will need to skillfully implement this strategy in order to achieve success in its business.
 
Human Capital Resources:
 
The area of development of the Membrane Extraction Technology is novel and highly specialized both its process and in the construction of machinery and equipment necessary to commercialize the technology. There are a limited number of experts that are capable of understanding or working in the field. Many of these experts are not resident in the US and will require visas to commence working with the Company. There is no guarantee that the Company can find adequate numbers of such personnel, attract them to work for the Company, secure their right to work in the US at the Company’s offices or retain them. This may inhibit the growth of the Company. Moving forward, additional personnel will be required to complete the commercialization of the Membrane Extraction Technology and while more readily available, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure sufficient of the right resources to pursue its goals. While the Company is too young to have seen what impact the COVID-19 pandemic could have had on its business operations, it is increasingly anticipated that there will be other pandemics of a similar nature or with a similar disruptive effect. The advent of one or more of such crisis and the resulting lock-downs or trade and travel restrictions may have a serious effect on the business, more so since the Company is launching its commercialization and the path to profitability must be entirely negotiated, with the creation of production facilities, organization of supply lines and distribution and securing of regular business. In the event of another pandemic or similar disruption, the Company may be worse effected than established businesses.

Environmental:
 
The Membrane Technology is considered by Management to be a clean technology that will remove a number of polluting and non-sustainable technologies currently operating in the environment. There may be certain issues with regards to the manner in which the technology is deployed or the disposal and recycling to the final units that is not yet known that may have an adverse impact on the environment and this may cause legislative changes that inhibit the manner in which the Company intends to carry out its business or to sell its products. In addition, the units will use certain materials, including thermoplastic materials, which are currently the subject of legislative efforts to reduce, eliminate or require recycled material use; it is unlikely that the company can use recycled materials or substitute certain elements of its technology with alternative materials, without incurring considerable expense and time and this may have an adverse effect on the business.
Cybersecurity:
 
There is a general increase in cybersecurity incidents and data misuse. As a Company with new technology, the Company may be a significant target of attack by competitors, foreign governments and other interested parties. As the knowledge of the Company’s Membrane Extraction Technology becomes more widely known there is a significant risk of an attempt to gain access to the Company’s confidential information that could potentially result in a loss of markets and control on the commercialization process. Such a loss might potentially cripple the company’s ability to carry on its business in the way it plans.
Material Sources and Supply Chain Disruptions:
 
At present the Company is still finalizing the development of its Membrane Extraction Technology systems and while it is difficult to assess the final supply chain and material resourcing, the inability to source materials or to manufacture components may force the Company to design its system with regard to supply chain issues rather than full optimization and once supply chains are established wars, embargos, pandemics and natural disasters may have an adverse effect on the ability of the Company to produce in adequate quantities due to disruption.
Regulatory Issues:
 
The different potential areas of application for the Membrane Extraction Technology are diverse. Some fields of application have a more controlling regulatory environment than others. Lithium extraction is becoming more controlled in countries where it is mined due, among other factors, to the enormous disruption of water resources and environmental hazard. Changes to regulations may make the introduction of a new technology more difficult by creating additional barriers. The same applies in the field of the refining of oils for human consumption. The heavy regulatory environment may delay the introduction of the Membrane Extraction Technology. Changes and potential changes in laws, regulations, policies and also political leadership may result in increased difficulties in bringing the Membrane Extraction Technology to market.
COVID-19 Pandemic.
 
In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to a number of other countries. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Several countries around the world, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict travel which has and may continue to restrict the flow of labor and products and impede the travel of personnel, may impact our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Disruptions to our business operations, or to our vendors’ or customers’ business operations, could include disruptions from the closure of facilities or the ability to travel. If a critical number of our employees or consultants become too ill to work, or we are not able to access sufficient human resources due to enforced office closures, our ability to conduct our business could be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. Similarly, if our customers experience adverse business consequences due to COVID-19, or any other, pandemic, demand for our services could also be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. Global health concerns, such as COVID-19, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries and localities in which we or our vendors and customers operate. Any of these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Competition
 
The Company encounters substantial competition from a wide variety of entities in both of its business lines, most of which is from companies which are better capitalized than the Company. Many of these entities will have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than the Company and will therefore be in a better position than the Company to obtain access to attractive business opportunities. The actions of these companies to exclude or interfere with the Company’s Business may have an adverse effect on the Business.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 8 full time employees.
