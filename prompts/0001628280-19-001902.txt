Lydall’s flux® product family includes several patented or IP-rich products that address applications which include: Direct Exhaust Mount heat shields, which are assembled to high temperature components like catalytic converters, turbochargers or exhaust manifolds using aluminized and stainless steel and high performance and high temperature heat insulating materials; Powertrain heat shields that absorb noise at the source and do not contribute to the engine's noise budget; and durable, thermally robust solutions for temperature sensitive plastic components such as fuel tanks that are in proximity to high temperature heat sources. 
GENERAL BUSINESS INFORMATION
Lydall holds a number of patents, trademarks and licenses. While no single patent, trademark or license is critical to the success of Lydall, together these intangible assets are of considerable value to the Company.
Typically, the Company’s business can be slightly stronger in the first half of the calendar year given the timing of customer order patterns and planned customer shutdowns in North America and Europe that typically occur in the third and fourth quarters of each year. Lydall maintains levels of inventory and grants credit terms that are normal within the industries it serves. The Company uses a wide range of raw materials in the manufacturing of its products, including aluminum and other metals to manufacture most of its automotive heat shields and various glass and petroleum derived fibers in its Performance Materials, Technical Nonwovens, and Thermal Acoustical Solutions segments. The majority of raw materials used are generally available from a variety of suppliers.
Sales to Ford Motor Company accounted for 14.8%, 17.3% and 19.6% of Lydall’s net sales in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of Lydall's net sales in such years. 
Backlog at January 31, 2019 was $137.6 million. Lydall’s backlog was $114.4 million at December 31, 2018, $109.0 million at December 31, 2017, and $94.9 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in backlog at year-end 2018 compared to year-end 2017 was primarily driven by the Performance Materials segment due to the acquisition of the Interface business on August 31, 2018, offset by a decrease in backlog in the Technical Nonwovens segment due to timing of projects in 2017. Thermal Acoustical Solutions segment backlog, which comprises the majority of total backlog, may be impacted by various assumptions, including future automotive production volume estimates, changes in program launch timing and changes in customer development plans. The Company believes that global automotive orders are typically fulfilled within a two month period and therefore represent a reasonable time frame to be included as Thermal Acoustical Solutions segment backlog. 
No material portion of Lydall’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any governmental body.
Lydall believes that its plants and equipment are overall, in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment (See Item 3, Legal Proceedings).
As of December 31, 2018, Lydall employed approximately 3,300 people. The Company has approximately 250 employees in the United States under union contracts expiring between February 2019 through July 2022. All employees at the facilities in France and the Netherlands are covered under a National Collective Bargaining Agreement. Certain salaried and all hourly employees in Germany, the United Kingdom, China, Canada and India are also covered under some form of a National Collective Bargaining Agreement. Lydall considers its employee relationships to be satisfactory.
There are no significant anticipated operating risks related to foreign investment law, expropriation, or availability of material, labor or energy. The foreign and domestic operations attempt to limit foreign currency exchange transaction risk by completing transactions in functional currencies whenever practical or through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts when deemed appropriate.
