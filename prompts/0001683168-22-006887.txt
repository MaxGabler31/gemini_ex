Covid-19
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, has adversely affected workforces, customers, economies, and financial markets globally. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses. This outbreak could decrease spending, adversely affect demand for the Company’s products, and harm the Company’s business and results of operations. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company believes the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially impact its operating results due to the nature of the Company’s business and its operations. The Company has not observed any impairments of its assets or a significant change in the fair value of its assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, it is not possible for the Company to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on the Company’s business or results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
 
Vegetable Oil Refining 
 
Our first commercial application for our technology has been the CTi Nano Neutralization® System which has been utilized to improve edible vegetable oil refining process. Our environmentally friendly process has been shown to reduce refining costs, increase oil yield, and limit the number of chemical additives used in chemical refining of vegetables oils. This patented process (US Patent # 7,762,715 and # 8,042,989) is designed to be incorporated into new and existing soybean, rapeseed, canola and palm vegetable oil refineries.
 
Our first pilot test of our CTi NANO Neutralization® System was conducted in 2010 at Carolina Soya, a 200-metric ton/day crude soy oil refining plant in Estill, South Carolina. Our second system, which became operational in fiscal 2011, has been continuously utilized since 2011 at the plant that processes approximately 450 metric tons per day of soy oil. Further, we have successfully shipped over 50 systems domestically and internationally. We also continuously focus on developing additional Nano Reactor® applications and managing the intellectual property issues associated with new processes and applications.
 
The global consumption of vegetable oils has grown consistently at a rate of about 4.1% p.a. from 90.5 million metric tons (MMT) in 2001 to approximately 213 million metric tons (MMT) in 2021-2022. In 2021-2022 consumption of vegetable oil was 213.2 MMT compared to 206.4 MMT in 2020-2021, an increase approximately 3% (https://www.statista.com/statistics/263978/global-vegetable-oil-production-since-2000-2001/). It is also a highly competitive commodity market in which the lowest-cost producer has the advantage.
 
Desmet Ballestra Agreement 
 
On May 14, 2012, we signed a global R&D, Marketing and Technology License Agreement with Desmet Ballestra Group s.a. (Desmet), a Belgian company that is actively marketing the NANO Neutralization® System, the key component of which is our Nano Reactor® to soybean and other vegetable oil refiners. The Agreement provided Desmet (licensee) a limited, exclusive license and right to develop, design and supply our NANO Neutralization® System which incorporates Nano Reactor® devices on a global basis tools and fats and oleo chemical applications. The agreement expired in May 2015.

On January 22, 2016, Desmet and the Company executed a new three year License Agreement with essentially the same terms with the May 2012 agreement that was effective August 1, 2015. As part of the agreement, Desmet provided, under certain conditions, limited monthly advance payments of $50,000 to be applied against gross profit share from future sales. The agreement expired in August 2018.
 
On October 1, 2018, Desmet and the Company executed a new three year License Agreement with essentially the same terms with the January 2016 agreement. As part of the agreement, Desmet provided us under certain conditions, limited monthly advances of $50,000 through October 1, 2021, to be applied against gross profit share from future sales. The agreement expired in October 2021.
 
On November 1, 2021, Desmet and the Company executed a new three-year License Agreement. As part of the agreement, Desmet provides the Company monthly advances of $40,000 through November 1, 2024, to be applied against from future reactor sales.
 
Desmet, together with its affiliates, is a global engineering and equipment supply firm engaged in the development, design and supply of process equipment for oils and fats processing facilities including vegetable oil refining, biofuel, oleo chemical, seed crushing, surfactant and detergent markets. Desmet supplies these markets with services based on the latest globally sourced technologies. Desmet has relationships with major refiners globally A significant portion of global vegetable oil refineries include major refiners such as Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill, Inc. and Bunge Limited. Desmet has more than 40 sales representatives selling in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Since its founding in 1946, Desmet reports that it has built a global network that includes 1,300 employees, 17 global and 8 representative offices, and more than 6,000 lines in a variety of applications. Desmet operates a separate division for each of the above markets and the Desmet Oils & Fats division has supplied small and large plants to approximately 1,900 oil millers in 150 countries, covering over 6,300 process sections.
 
Along with Desmet, we have been working together to accelerate appropriate sales goals and installation process. Our CTi Nano Neutralization® Systems is designed to be used as an add-on process to an existing neutralization system within soybean and other vegetable oil refineries. Desmet’s focus has been on marketing our CTi Nano Neutralization® Systems to vegetable oil refiners to help them increase profits through cost savings and improved oil yields. Desmet purchases our CTi Nano Neutralization® Systems from us and installs them at the refinery as part of an integrated neutralization system. Based on successful commercial implementations, Desmet guarantees minimum economic benefits to a facility that installs our CTi Nano Neutralization® Systems. We are therefore substantially dependent on Desmet to identify prospects, complete sales contracts, install the system and manage relationships with end-users.
 
Additionally, in fiscal 2017 Desmet installed our first Nano Reactor® at a bio-diesel production plant in South America. Bio-diesel industry has been under pricing pressure for a considerable period of time and slow to adopt to newer technologies. We are continuously working with Desmet pursuing additional sales opportunities in Asia and South America, however, the acceptance of our technology has been slow and there were no sales generated in our Fiscal 2022.
 
Enviro Watertek, LLC
 
In April 2019, the Company and Delaware Water Company, LLC (Delaware) formed a limited liability company called Enviro WaterTek LLC (“Enviro” ,“EW”). Enviro is owned 50% by the Company and 50% by Delaware, and the Company accounts for its investment in Enviro under the equity method of accounting. From 2019 to 2021, Enviro had insignificant operations. This agreement covers our first commercial entrance into industrial treatment of produced and frac water. Fracking industry has seen a significant growth over the past ten years, reaching daily water consumption volume of over 58 million barrels per day. Our newly designed Low Pressure Nano Reactor (LPN™) was specifically developed to be integrated into produced water treatment system along with our proprietary chemical formulations, and has depicted measurable and quantifiable advantages over industry standard processes and equipment. Our agreement with EW provides for sales on LPN™ plus recurring revenue stream based on processing of produced and frac water volumes and utilization. Our agreement with EW has a fifteen-year term. In March 2020, global pandemic of COVID-19 has taken an unexpected negative impact on the oil and gas industry worldwide, and has consequently impaired our ability to rapidly accelerate LPN™ sales and recurring revenue stream. While the industry has gone through a major overhaul, we are seeing a gradual recovery in the industry. Our current system installations can handle approximately 25,000 barrels per day (BPD), and we received $46,000 in total revenue in our Fiscal 2022 from sale of reactors and usage fee.

Alchemy Beverages, Inc
 
In fiscal 2014, Roman Gordon, one of our shareholders and a former officer, formed a company, Cameo USA LLC (Cameo). Since its formation, Cameo has had no revenue, no operations, and has had no assets or liabilities. On June 4, 2018, Mr. Gordon contributed his 100% interest in Cameo to Cavitation Technologies, Inc. As Mr. Gordon had no reasonable and objectively supportable basis in the valuation of his investment in Cameo, there was no value assigned to the contribution of Cameo.
 
On June 29, 2018, we agreed to license Cameo to Alchemy Beverages Inc. (“ABI”). In addition, we have agreed to provide certain licensing rights related to our miniature low pressure nano-reactor (MLPN) to be used in developing and manufacturing of small home appliances to enhance alcoholic beverages. In consideration for these ABI has agreed to issue 19.9% of ABI’s outstanding common shares to us (limited to 20 million shares of ABI). ABI is a private company and in the business of producing and selling alcoholic beverages, equipment, and home appliances. Prior to this agreement, ABI was independent of CTI and had no relation to us nor to our management.
 
Pursuant to the licensing agreements, ABI will have the exclusive global marketing and distribution rights of Cameo and our patented and patent pending technologies for the processing of alcoholic beverages. We have agreed to assist in the installation and maintenance of the MLPN to ABI and will receive royalty payments ranging from 1% to 3% on all net revenues, as defined in our license agreement for the life of the applicable patents. In addition, we will receive leasing, consulting, and manufacturing fees as defined in the licensing agreement.
 
As of June 30, 2022 and the date of this report, ABI has not generated any sales under Cameo brand. Since June 2018, the Company and ABI have developed a small table top home appliance unit Barmuze® utilizing MLPN , allowing consumers to experience a new way of enjoying wines and spirits, utilizing CTi’s patented and patent pending technologies to molecularly restructure alcohol, convert harsh acids to pleasant tasting esters, and reduce levels of certain impurities commonly present in alcohol.
 
During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we have received approval for several patent applications, protecting our technology and processing rights, expanding our broad portfolio of patents.
 
During fiscals 2022 and 2021, there were no sales or royalties generated pertaining to our agreement with Alchemy Beverages, Inc. The investment in ABI has no value assigned to it, which approximates its fair value.
 
Customers Dependence
 
We continue to sell our industrial capacity Nano Reactor® and Nano Neutralization® System through our strategic partner Desmet and most of our revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, was derived from sales of reactors to Desmet and the corresponding gross profit share. We have generated minimal revenue pertaining to our licensing agreement with EW in our fiscal 2022. We had no revenue of LPN™ due to COVID-19, whereas oil production in US has negative impact on oil & gas industry. Oil and gas industry has seen a recovery, while price of oil has spiked to around $100 per barrel, and we foresee a great opportunity for our technology providing a significant upside potential both at the point of sale and recurring revenue stream.
 
Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers
 
We have historically sourced reactor components from various domestic and international suppliers. We do not have any long-term contracts, agreements, or commitments with any supplier. We believe it would take approximately 30 days to find a new supplier, if necessary.

Competition
 
Our competitors who sell equipment and engineering services for the vegetable oil refining business are a myriad of companies both large and small that provide equipment and technology to oil refiners. These include known companies that have longer operating histories, more experience, and stronger financial capabilities. Competitors include Alfa Laval, and Crown Iron Works as well as many firms that provide advice and services to small and regional firms. In addition, Arisdyne Systems, a designer of cavitation devices, is marketing a system using similar technology. The vegetable oil refining business is a highly competitive commodity market in which the lowest-cost producer has the advantage. We intend to compete by offering solutions that help our clients remain or become a low-cost producer. Because the industry in which we compete has had limited new technology introduced in the last 50 years, we believe our CTi Nano Neutralization® Systems provide a unique opportunity for refiners to increase margins. We seek to differentiate ourselves by offering solutions based on our proprietary and patented designs, processes, and applications to help our clients described in our issued and patent pending applications. We compete by offering solutions that we believe can reduce operating expenses and increase oil yield vs currently applied technologies.
 
In addition, our competitors in produced and frac water treatment application range from local service providers to multi-national global corporations with considerable financial resources, engineering expertise, established and proven technologies. We believe that LPN™ is a conceptually new technology that has not been introduced in the field of water treatment applications up to now. LPN™ has demonstrated exceptional results in treating produced and frac water commercially, significantly reducing the usage of hazards chemicals during the process, meanwhile, achieving desirable water quality for industrial re-use or disposal.
 
Patents
 
Our Cavitation Generator patent was issued during fiscal 2011. In addition, we have a patent for our Multi-Stage Cavitation Device Nano Reactor® that was issued on October 25, 2011. In the fiscal 2014 we received approvals for another apparatus patent and 2 additional process patents in the US. As of June 30, 2022, our portfolio of patents included 19 issued patents in the United States and 12 issued patents internationally. Our patents cover multiple process and applications of our technology in vegetable oil refining, production of biodiesel, treatment of process and industrial water, upgrade of hydrocarbons and enhancing of alcoholic beverages. We continuously develop new technologies and applications, as we have filed new patent applications for Low Pressure Nano-Reactors LPN™. LPN™ is a highly efficient homogenizer and emulsifier that can be utilized in multiple fluids processing applications. Recently, we have filed a patent application for a small home appliance. This new product is designed directly with consumer in mind and the first step for our company to introduce our technology outside of the industrial sector where we typically sell our products.
