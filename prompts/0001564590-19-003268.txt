ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Unless the context otherwise requires or indicates, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Arlington Asset” refer to Arlington Asset Investment Corp., and all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company,” refer to Arlington Asset Investment Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 Our Company
 We are an investment firm that focuses on acquiring and holding a levered portfolio of residential mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), consisting of agency MBS and private-label MBS. Agency MBS include residential mortgage pass-through certificates for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by either a U.S. government sponsored enterprise (“GSE”), such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), or by a U.S. government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”). Private-label MBS, or non-agency MBS, include residential MBS that are not guaranteed by a GSE or the U.S. government. As of December 31, 2018, nearly all of our investment capital was allocated to agency MBS.  
 We leverage prudently our investment portfolio so as to increase potential returns to our shareholders. We fund our investments primarily through short-term financing arrangements, principally though repurchase agreements. We enter into various hedging transactions to mitigate the interest rate sensitivity of our cost of borrowing and the value of our MBS portfolio.
 For our tax years ended December 31, 2018 and earlier, we were taxed as a C corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. Commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2019, we intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”).  As a REIT we will be required to distribute annually 90% of our REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments).  So long as we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. 
Federal or state corporate income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders on a timely basis.  At present, it is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable income, although we will not be required to do so. We intend to make distributions of our taxable income within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year.  
 We are a Virginia corporation that is internally managed and do not have an external investment advisor.
 Investment Strategy
 We manage our investment portfolio with the goal of obtaining a high risk-adjusted return on capital. We evaluate the rates of return that can be achieved in each asset class and for each individual security within an asset class in which we invest. We then evaluate opportunities against the returns available in each of our investment alternatives and attempt to allocate our assets and capital with an emphasis toward what we believe to be the highest risk-adjusted return available. We expect this strategy will cause us to have different allocations of capital and leverage in different market environments.
 Based on current market conditions, we believe investment opportunities in agency MBS provides us with higher relative risk-adjusted rates of return than most other investment opportunities we have evaluated. Consequently, we have allocated nearly all of our investment capital in agency MBS as of December 31, 2018.  We continue to analyze other investment opportunities relative to risk-adjusted returns available on agency MBS investments. 
 In the future, we may invest in other types of residential mortgage assets such as residential mortgage loans, mortgage servicing rights and GSE credit risk transfer securities, as well as other types of assets, including commercial MBS, asset backed securities, other structured securities, commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, and other real estate-related loans and securities. In addition, we also may pursue other business activities that would utilize our experience in analyzing investment opportunities and applying similar portfolio management skills. However, investing in other asset classes or pursuing other business activities may be limited by our desire to continue to qualify as a REIT. We may change our investment strategy at any time without the consent of our shareholders; accordingly, in the future, we could make investments or enter into hedging transactions that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and associated hedging transactions described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Agency MBS
 Agency MBS consist of residential pass-through certificates that are securities representing undivided interests in “pools” of mortgage loans secured by residential real property. The monthly payments of both principal and interest of the securities are guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or GSE to holders of the securities, in effect “passing through” the monthly payments made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities plus “guarantee payments” made in the event of any defaults on such mortgage loans, net of fees paid to the issuer/guarantor and servicers of the underlying mortgage loans, to the holders of the securities. Mortgage pass-through certificates distribute cash flows from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis among the holders of the securities. Although the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or GSE to the security holder, the market value of the agency MBS is not guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or GSE.
 The agency MBS that we primarily invest in are agency MBS issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are stockholder-owned corporations chartered by Congress with a public mission to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability to the U.S. housing market. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”), and are currently operating under the conservatorship of the FHFA. The U.S. Treasury has agreed to support the continuing operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with any necessary capital contributions while in conservatorship. However, the U.S. government does not guarantee the securities, or other obligations, of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.  
 We also invest in agency MBS issued by Ginnie Mae. Ginnie Mae is a wholly-owned corporate instrumentality of the United States within HUD. Ginnie Mae guarantees the timely payment of the principal and interest on certificates that represent an interest in a pool of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), or partially guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs and other loans eligible for inclusion in mortgage pools underlying Ginnie Mae certificates. Section 306(g) of the Housing Act provides that the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guaranty by Ginnie Mae. 
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae operate in the secondary mortgage market. They provide funds to the mortgage market by purchasing residential mortgages from primary mortgage market institutions, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, seller/servicers, securities dealers and other investors. Through the mortgage securitization process, they package mortgage loans into guaranteed MBS for sale to investors, such as us, in the form of pass-through certificates and guarantee the payment of principal and interest on the securities or on the underlying loans held within the securitization trust in exchange for guarantee fees. The underlying loans of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agency MBS must meet certain underwriting standards established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (referred to as “conforming loans”) and may be fixed or adjustable rate loans with original terms to maturity generally up to 40 years.
 Agency MBS differ from other forms of traditional fixed-income securities which normally provide for periodic payments of interest in fixed amounts with principal payments at maturity. Instead, agency MBS provide for a monthly payment that consists of both interest and principal. In addition, outstanding principal on the agency MBS may be prepaid, without penalty, at par at any time due to prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans. These differences can result in significantly greater price and yield volatility than is the case with more traditional fixed-income securities.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s agency MBS portfolio was generally comprised of securities collateralized by pools of fixed rate mortgages that have original terms to maturity of 30 years. In the future, we may also invest in agency MBS collateralized by adjustable-rate mortgage loans (“ARMs”), hybrid ARMs, or loans with original terms to maturity of 15 or 20 years.
 We may also invest in agency MBS through agency collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”), which are structured securities representing divided interests in the cash flows of underlying agency residential pass-through certificates.  Agency CMOs consist of multiple classes of securities, called tranches, which have different maturities, coupon rates, and payment priorities designed to meet the risk and yield appetites of various classes of investors. CMOs also include “stripped” securities, whereby certain tranche holders receive only interest payments from the underlying securities while other tranche holders receive only principal payments.
 We purchase agency MBS either in initial offerings or in the secondary market through broker-dealers or similar entities. We may also utilize to-be-announced (“TBA”) forward contracts in order to invest in agency MBS or to hedge our investments. A TBA security is a forward contract for the purchase or the sale of agency securities at a predetermined price, face amount, issuer, coupon and stated maturity on an agreed-upon future date, but the particular agency securities to be delivered are not identified until shortly before the TBA settlement date. We may also choose, prior to settlement, to move the settlement of these securities out to a later date by entering into an offsetting position (referred to as a “pair off”), net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously entering into a similar TBA contract for a later settlement date, which is commonly collectively referred to as a “dollar roll” transaction.
 Private-Label MBS
 We have and, depending upon market conditions, may in the future invest in private-label MBS, which are residential MBS that are not issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or a GSE. Private-label MBS are often referred to as non-agency MBS. The private-label MBS in which we may invest are generally backed by a pool of single-family residential mortgage loans. These certificates are issued by originators of, investors in, and other owners of residential mortgage loans, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, commercial banks, mortgage banks, investment banks and special purpose “conduit” subsidiaries of these institutions. Private-label MBS can carry a significantly higher level of credit exposure relative to the credit exposure of agency MBS. The private-label MBS in which we may invest are generally non-investment grade or not rated by major rating agencies.
 While agency MBS are backed by the express obligation or guarantee of a U.S. government agency or GSE as described above, private-label MBS are generally only supported by one or more forms of private (i.e., non-governmental) credit enhancement. These credit enhancements provide an extra layer of loss coverage in the event that losses are incurred upon foreclosure sales or other liquidations of underlying mortgaged properties in amounts that exceed the equity holder’s equity interest in the property. Forms of credit enhancement include limited issuer guarantees, reserve funds, private mortgage guaranty pool insurance, overcollateralization and subordination. Subordination is a form of credit enhancement frequently used and involves the issuance of classes of MBS that are subordinate to senior class MBS and, accordingly, are the first to absorb credit losses realized on the underlying mortgage loans. In addition, private-label MBS are generally purchased at a discount to par value, which may provide further protection to credit losses of the underlying residential mortgage loan collateral. 
 Private-label MBS are backed by pools of residential mortgages that can be composed of prime or non-prime mortgage loans. Prime mortgage loans are residential mortgage loans that generally conform to the underwriting guidelines of a U.S. government agency or a GSE but that do not carry any credit guarantee from either a U.S. government agency or a GSE. Jumbo prime mortgage loans are prime mortgage loans that conform to such underwriting guidelines except with respect to maximum loan size. Non-prime mortgage loans are residential mortgage loans that do not meet all of the underwriting guidelines of a U.S. government agency or a GSE. Consequently, these loans may carry higher credit risk than prime mortgage loans. Non-prime mortgage loans may have been originated through programs that allow borrowers to qualify for a mortgage loan with reduced or alternative forms of documentation. Non-prime mortgage loans include loans commonly referred to as alternative A-paper (“Alt-A”) or as subprime. Alt-A mortgage loans are generally considered riskier than prime mortgage loans and less risky than subprime mortgage loans. Alt-A mortgage loans are typically characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher loan-to-value ratios and include a higher percentage of investment properties as collateral. Subprime mortgage loans are considered to be of the lowest credit quality. These loans may also include “option-ARM” loans, which contain a feature providing the borrower the option, within certain constraints, to make lesser payments than otherwise required by the stated interest rate for a number of years, leading to negative amortization and increased loan balances. 
 In addition to being categorized as either prime or non-prime mortgage loans, residential mortgage loans included in private-label MBS may also be classified as being either a qualified or non-qualified mortgage.  A qualified mortgage is a mortgage that meets certain requirements for lender protection and secondary trading under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  In general, a qualified mortgage (i) contains less risky loan features, such as interest-only periods, negative amortization or balloon payments, (ii) has debt-to-income ratio limits, (iii) has limits on origination points and fees, and (iv) has certain legal 
 3

protections for lenders.   Qualified mortgages may or may not meet the underwriting standards of a U.S. government agency or GSE.  In general, non-qualified mortgage loans carry a higher credit risk than qualified mortgage loans.
 Private-label MBS are generally issued by a securitization trust referred to as a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (“REMIC”). The securitization trust will generally issue both senior and subordinated interests. Senior securities are those interests in a securitization that have the first right to cash flows and are last in line to absorb losses, and, therefore, have the least credit risk in a securitization transaction. In general, most, if not all, principal collected from the underlying mortgage loan pool is used to pay down the senior securities until certain performance tests are satisfied. If certain performance tests are satisfied, principal payments are allocated, generally on a pro rata basis, between the senior securities and the subordinated securities. Conversely, the most subordinate securities are those interests in a securitization that have the last right to cash flows and are first in line to absorb losses. Subordinate securities absorb the initial credit losses from a securitization structure, thus protecting the senior securities. Subordinate securities generally receive interest payments even if they do not receive principal payments.
 In addition, private-label MBS also may include a re-securitization of MBS which is also referred to as a “re-REMIC” security. For example, a re-REMIC security may consist of re-securitized senior classes of REMIC securities. In turn, the collateral of these senior class REMIC securities consists of the underlying residential mortgage loans. The re-REMIC securitization trust will generally issue both senior and subordinated interests similar to a REMIC securitization trust. A subordinated interest in a re-securitized senior class of REMIC securities may also be referred to as a “mezzanine” interest.
 Financing Strategy
 We use leverage to finance a portion of our MBS portfolio and to seek to increase potential returns to our shareholders. To the extent that revenue derived from our MBS portfolio exceeds our interest expense and other costs of the financing, our net income will be greater than if we had not borrowed funds and had not invested in the assets. Conversely, if the revenue from our MBS portfolio does not sufficiently cover the interest expense and other costs of the financing, our net income will be less or our net loss will be greater than if we had not borrowed funds.
 Because of the interest rate risk inherent to our agency MBS investment strategy and, to extent we invest in private-label MBS, the credit risks inherent to such investment strategy, we closely monitor the leverage (debt-to-equity ratio) of our MBS portfolio. Our leverage may vary from time to time depending upon several factors, including changes in the value of the underlying MBS and hedge portfolio, changes in investment allocation between agency MBS and private-label MBS, the timing and amount of investment purchases or sales, and our assessment of risk and returns.
 We finance our investments in MBS using short-term secured borrowings, which primarily consist of repurchase agreements. We have also issued, and may issue in the future, long-term unsecured notes as an additional source of financing.
 When we engage in a repurchase transaction, we initially sell securities to the counterparty under a master repurchase agreement in exchange for cash from the counterparty. The counterparty is obligated to resell the same securities back to us at the end of the term of the repurchase agreement, which typically is 30 to 60 days, but may have maturities as short as one day or as long as one year. Amounts available to be borrowed under our repurchase agreements are dependent upon lender collateral requirements and the lender’s determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral, which fluctuates with changes in interest rates, credit quality and liquidity conditions within the investment banking, mortgage finance and real estate industries. In addition, our counterparties apply a “haircut” to our pledged collateral, which means our collateral is valued, for the purposes of the repurchase transaction, at less than market value. Under our repurchase agreements, we typically pay a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), plus or minus a fixed spread. These transactions are accounted for as secured financings, and we present the investment securities and related funding on our consolidated balance sheets.
 We may also seek to obtain other sources of financing depending on market conditions. We may finance the acquisition of agency MBS by entering into TBA dollar roll transactions in which we would sell a TBA contract for current month settlement and simultaneously purchase from the same counterparty a similar TBA contract for a forward settlement date. Prior to the forward settlement date, we may choose to roll the position out to a later date by entering into an offsetting TBA position, net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously entering into a similar TBA contract for a later settlement date. In such transactions, the TBA contract purchased for a forward settlement date is priced at a discount to the TBA contract sold for settlement/pair-off in the current month. This difference (or discount) is referred to as the “price drop.” As discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— “Non-GAAP Core Operating Income,” we believe this price drop is the economic equivalent of net interest carry income (interest income less implied financing cost) earned from the underlying agency MBS over the roll period, which is commonly referred to as “dollar roll income.” Consequently, dollar roll transactions represent a form of off-balance sheet financing. In evaluating our overall leverage at risk, we consider both our on-balance and off-balance sheet financing.

Risk Management Strategy
 In conducting our business, we are exposed to market risks, including interest rate, prepayment, extension, spread, credit, liquidity and regulatory risks. We use a variety of strategies to manage a portion of our exposure to these risks to the extent we believe to be prudent, taking into account our investment strategy and the cost of any hedging transactions. As a result, we may not hedge certain interest rate, prepayment, extension, or credit risks if we believe that bearing such risks enhances our return relative to our risk/return profile. Our hedging instruments are generally not designed to protect our net book value from “spread risk” (also referred to as “basis risk”), which is the risk of an increase of the spread between the market yield on our agency MBS and the benchmark yield on U.S. Treasury securities or interest rate swaps.

• | Interest Rate Risk
--+-------------------

 We hedge some of our exposure to potential interest rate mismatches between the interest we earn on our long-term investments and the interest we pay on our short-term borrowings. We enter into various hedging transactions to mitigate the interest rate sensitivity of our cost of borrowing and the value of our MBS portfolio. Because a majority of our funding is in the form of repurchase agreements, our financing costs fluctuate based on short-term interest rate indices, such as LIBOR. Because the vast majority of our investments are assets that have fixed rates of interest and generally mature in up to 30 years, the interest we earn on these assets generally does not move in tandem with the interest rates that we pay on our repurchase agreements, which generally have a maturity of less than 60 days. In addition, as interest rates rise, the fair value of our fixed-rate agency MBS may be expected to decline.  We may experience reduced income, losses, or a significant reduction in our book value due to adverse interest rate movements. In order to attempt to mitigate a portion of such risk, we utilize certain hedging techniques to attempt to economically “lock in” a portion of the net spread between the interest we earn on our assets and the interest we pay on our financing costs and to protect our net book value.  
 Additionally, because prepayments on residential mortgages generally accelerate when interest rates decrease and slow when interest rates increase, mortgage securities typically exhibit “negative convexity”. In other words, certain mortgage securities in which we invest may increase in value to a lesser degree than similar duration bonds, or even fall in value, as interest rates decline. Conversely, certain mortgage securities in which we invest may decrease in value to a greater degree than similar duration bonds as interest rates increase. In order to manage this risk, we monitor, among other things, the “duration gap” between our mortgage assets and our hedge portfolio as well as our convexity exposure. Duration is an estimate of the relative expected percentage change in market value of our mortgage assets or our hedge portfolio that would be caused by a parallel change in short and long-term interest rates. Convexity exposure relates to the way the duration of our mortgage assets or our hedge portfolio changes when the interest rate or prepayment environment changes.
 The value of our mortgage assets may also be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the shape of the yield curve or by changes in the market's expectation about the volatility of future interest rates. We analyze our exposure to non-parallel changes in interest rates and to changes in the market's expectation of future interest rate volatility and take actions to attempt to mitigate these exposures.
  
• | Prepayment Risk
--+----------------

 Because residential borrowers have the option to prepay their mortgage loans at par at any time, we face the risk that we will experience a return of principal on our investments more quickly than anticipated, which we refer to as prepayment risk. Prepayment risk generally increases when interest rates decline. In this scenario, our financial results may be adversely affected as we may have to re-invest that principal at potentially lower yields.
 We may purchase securities that have a higher interest rate than the then-prevailing market interest rate. In exchange for this higher interest rate, we may pay a premium to par value to acquire such securities.  In accordance with GAAP, we amortize this premium as a reduction to interest income under the contractual effective interest method such that a proportional amount of the unamortized premium is amortized as principal prepayments occur.  If a security is prepaid in whole or in part at a faster rate than originally expected, we will amortize the purchase premium at a faster pace, resulting in a lower effective return on our investment than originally expected. 
 We also may purchase securities that have a lower interest rate than the then-prevailing market interest rate.  In exchange for this lower interest rate, we may pay a discount to par value to acquire such securities.  In accordance with GAAP, we accrete this discount as an increase to interest income under the contractual effective interest method such that a proportional amount of the unamortized discount is accreted as principal prepayments occur. If a security is prepaid in whole or in part at a slower rate than originally expected, we will accrete the purchased discount at a slower pace resulting in a lower effective return on our investment than originally expected.  
 5

 
• | Extension Risk
--+---------------

 Because residential borrowers have the option to make only scheduled payments on their mortgage loans, rather than prepay their mortgage loans, we face the risk that a return of capital on our investment will occur more slowly than anticipated, which we refer to as extension risk. Extension risk generally increases when interest rates rise. In this scenario, our financial results may be adversely affected as we may have to finance our investments at potentially higher costs without the ability to reinvest principal into higher yielding securities.
  
• | Spread Risk
--+------------

 
Because the spread between the market yield on our investments and benchmark interest rates, such as U.S. Treasury rates and interest rate swap rates, may vary, we are exposed to spread risk. The inherent spread risk associated with our agency MBS and the resulting fluctuations in fair value of these securities can occur independent of interest rates and may relate to other factors impacting the mortgage and fixed income markets, such as actual or anticipated monetary policy actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve, liquidity, or changes in market participants’ required rates of return on different assets. Consequently, while we use interest rate derivative instruments to attempt to protect our net book value against changes in benchmark interest rates, such instruments typically will not mitigate spread risk and, therefore, the value of our agency MBS and our net book value could decline.  We generally do not hedge the spread risk inherent in our agency MBS investment strategy.  
  
• | Credit Risk
--+------------

 To the extent we invest in private-label MBS, we accept mortgage credit exposure at levels we deem prudent within the context of our overall investment strategy. We may retain all or a portion of the credit risk on the loans underlying private-label MBS in which we may invest. We seek to manage this risk through prudent asset selection, pre-acquisition due diligence, post-acquisition performance monitoring, and the sale of assets for which we identify negative credit trends. Additionally, we vary the percentage mix of our private-label and agency MBS investments in an effort to actively adjust our credit exposure and to improve the risk/return profile of our investment portfolio.
  
• | Liquidity Risk
--+---------------

 Liquidity risk is the risk that we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of our inability to liquidate assets or obtain funding. Upon the maturity of our repurchase agreement financing, we may be unable to obtain repurchase agreement funding and may be required to sell assets, potentially at a loss.
 Liquidity risk also includes the risk that we are unable to fund daily margin requirements under our repurchase agreement financing or hedging instruments.  Repurchase agreements contain provisions that require us to pledge additional assets daily to the repurchase agreement counterparty in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral declines and such lender demands additional collateral, which may take the form of additional securities or cash.  Interest rate hedging instruments also contain provisions that require us to exchange daily cash variation margin with the counterparty based upon daily changes in the fair value of the interest rate hedging instruments.  
  
• | Regulatory Risk
--+----------------

 Regulatory risk is the risk of loss, including fines, penalties or restrictions in our activities from failing to comply with current or future federal, state or local laws (including federal and state securities laws), and rules and regulations pertaining to financial services activities, including the loss of our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the 1940 Act.
 We attempt to manage the above risks through the use of interest rate hedging instruments, asset selection and monitoring our overall leverage levels.
 One of the principal instruments that we use to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate, prepayment and extension risks are interest rate hedging instruments primarily consisting of interest rate swaps, U.S. Treasury note futures, options on U.S. Treasury note futures and options on agency MBS.  We also may use other interest rate hedging instruments such as Eurodollar futures, interest rate swap futures, interest rate swaptions, and short TBA positions, from time to time. 
 In addition to the hedging instruments discussed above, we also manage our exposure to interest rate, prepayment and extension risk through asset selection. Agency MBS with different original maturities, coupons, vintage and loan collateral characteristics will generally perform differently in various economic and interest rate environments.  We generally seek to invest in agency MBS that are specifically selected for their relatively lower propensity for prepayment. The pools of residential mortgage loans securing these agency MBS are commonly referred to as “specified pools.” These specified pools may include mortgage loans that (i) have low loan 
 6

balances, (ii) are originated through the Home Affordable Refinance Program (“HARP”) or some other government program, (iii) are originated in certain states or geographic areas, (iv) have high loan-to-value ratios, (v) are the obligations of borrowers with credit scores that fall toward the lower end of the range of GSEs’ underwriting standards, or (vi) are secured by investor properties. The borrowers of these mortgage loans are believed to have less incentive to refinance. Accordingly, agency MBS collateralized by mortgage loans with these characteristics are believed to be better “protected” from prepayment risk than agency MBS collateralized by more generic pools of mortgage loans. In general, agency MBS backed by specified pools trade at a price premium over generic agency TBA securities. As of December 31, 2018, our on-balance sheet agency MBS portfolio is comprised primarily of securities backed by specified pools selected for their lower prepayment characteristics.
 To the extent that we employ greater leverage in our investment strategy, our exposure to the above market risks will generally be greater.  Accordingly, we carefully monitor our overall leverage levels to manage our exposure to interest rate, prepayment, extension and spread risks.
 The risk management actions we take may lower our earnings and dividends in the short term to further our objective of maintaining attractive levels of earnings and dividends over the long term. In addition, some of our hedges are intended to provide protection against larger rate moves and, as a result, may be relatively ineffective for smaller changes in interest rates. There can be no certainty that our projections of our exposures to interest rate, prepayment, extension, credit or other risks will be accurate or that our hedging activities will be effective and, therefore, actual results could differ materially.
 Other Business Ventures
 We formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Rock Creek Investment Advisors, LLC (“Rock Creek”), which was approved as a registered investment adviser and is regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), in the fourth quarter of 2018 and commenced operations in December 2018.  Rock Creek provides investment advisory services to institutional clients on a separate account basis by investing primarily in agency MBS. Rock Creek earns investment management fee income based upon a percentage of the capital funded by a client to its separate managed account. As of December 31, 2018, Rock Creek had assets under management of $50 million.  
Competition
 Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire MBS at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. In acquiring these assets, we compete with mortgage finance and specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, mortgage real estate investment trusts, investment banking firms, other lenders, the U.S. Treasury, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, other governmental bodies, and other entities. In addition, there are numerous entities with similar asset acquisition objectives and others may be organized in the future which may increase competition for the available supply of MBS that meet our investment objectives. Additionally, our investment strategy is dependent on the amount of financing available to us in the repurchase agreement market, which may also be impacted by competing borrowers. Our investment strategy will be adversely impacted if we are not able to secure financing on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, competition is intense for the recruitment and retention of qualified professionals. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our continued ability to attract new professionals and retain and motivate our existing professionals. For a further discussion of the competitive factors affecting our business, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Tax Status
 For our tax years ended December 31, 2018 and earlier, we were taxed as a C corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. Commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2019, we intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.  As a REIT, we will be required to distribute annually 90% of our REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments).  So long as we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. Federal or state corporate income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders on a timely basis.  Any amounts not distributed are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate taxes.  At present, it is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable income, although we will not be required to do so. We intend to make distributions of our taxable income within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year.  
 Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to continually meet requirements imposed upon REITs by the Internal Revenue Code, including satisfying certain organizational requirements, an annual distribution requirement and quarterly asset and annual income tests.  The REIT asset and income tests are significant to our operations as they restrict the extent to which we can invest in certain types of securities and conduct certain hedging activities within the REIT.  
 Income Tests
 7

To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis:
  
1. | At least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year generally must be derived from investments in real property or mortgages on real property.

2. | At least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year generally must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, gains from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, which need not have any relation to real property.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Interest income and gains from the disposition of obligations secured by mortgages on real property, such as agency MBS, constitute qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test described above.  There is no direct authority with respect to the qualification of income or gains from TBAs for the 75% gross income test; however, we treat income and gains from commitments to purchase TBAs as qualifying income under the 75% gross income test based on an opinion of legal counsel.  
 Income earned by a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) is not attributable to the REIT.  As a result, income that might not be qualifying income for the purpose of the income tests applicable to a REIT could be earned by a TRS without affecting our status as a REIT.  A TRS is an entity that is taxable as a corporation in which we directly or indirectly own the stock and that elects with us to be treated as a TRS. 
 Income and gains from instruments that we use to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings incurred, or to be incurred, to acquire real estate assets will generally be excluded from both gross income tests, provided that specified requirements are met.  To the extent that we enter into hedging instruments that are not a hedge of our interest rate risk associated with our borrowings incurred to acquire real estate assets or are not properly designated as such, the gross income and gains from such hedging transactions will likely be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and may also be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test.  However, we may conduct such hedging activities through a TRS, the income of which may be subject to income tax rather than participating in the arrangements directly through the REIT.
 Asset Tests
 At the close of each calendar quarter, we must satisfy five gross asset tests relating to the nature of our assets:
  
1. | At least 75% of the value of our assets must be represented by some combination of real estate assets, cash, cash items, U.S. Government securities, stock in other REITs and debt instruments of publicly offered REITs, and, under some circumstances, temporary investments in stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital. For this purpose, interests in mortgage loans secured by real property such as agency MBS are treated as real estate assets. Assets that do not qualify for purposes of the 75% asset test are subject to the additional tests described below. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The value of any one issuer’s securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | We may not own more than 10% of any issuer’s outstanding securities, as measured by either voting power or value. The 5% and 10% asset tests do not apply to securities of TRSs and qualified REIT subsidiaries and the 10% test does not apply to “straight debt” having specified characteristics and to certain other securities. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | The aggregate value of all securities of all TRSs that we hold may not exceed 20% of the value of our total assets.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | No more than 25% of the total value of our assets may be represented by certain non-mortgage debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If we should fail to satisfy the income or asset tests, such a failure would not cause us to lose our REIT qualification if we were able to eliminate the discrepancy within a specified cure period, in the case of the asset tests, satisfy certain relief provisions and pay any applicable penalty taxes and other fines.  Please refer to the “Risks Related to Taxation” in “Item 1A Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for further discussion of REIT qualification requirements and related items.
 Net Operating Loss and Net Capital Loss Carryforwards
 As of December 31, 2018, we had estimated net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $15 million that can be used to reduce our future distribution requirements. Our NOL carryforwards expire in 2028. As of December 31, 2018, we also had estimated net capital loss (“NCL”) carryforwards of $424 million that can be used to offset future net capital gains. The scheduled expirations of our NCL carryforwards are $137 million in 2019, $103 million in 2020, $70 million in 2021, $4 million in 2022 and $110 million in 2023. As of December 31, 2018, we also had AMT credit carryforwards of $9 million that can be used to offset future regular tax liabilities.

For the tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020, to the extent that AMT credit carryovers exceed the regular tax liability, 50% of the excess AMT credit carryforwards would be refundable in that year with any remaining AMT credit carryforwards fully refundable in 2021. 
 Our ability to use our NOLs, NCLs and built-in losses would be limited if we experienced an “ownership change” under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an “ownership change” would occur if there is a cumulative change in the ownership of our common stock of more than 50% by one or more “5% shareholders” during a three-year period. Our Board of Directors adopted and our shareholders approved a shareholder rights agreement (“Rights Plan”) in an effort to protect against a possible limitation on the our ability to use our NOL carryforwards, NCL carryforwards, and built-in losses under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Rights Plan was adopted to dissuade any person or group from acquiring 4.9% or more of our outstanding Class A common stock without the approval of our Board of Directors and triggering an “ownership change” as defined by Section 382. 
 Our Exclusion from Regulation as an Investment Company
 We intend to operate so as to be excluded from regulation under the 1940 Act. We rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act, which provides an exclusion for entities that are “primarily engaged in purchasing or otherwise acquiring . . . interests in real estate.” Section 3(c)(5)(C) as interpreted by the staff of the SEC provides an exclusion from registration for a company if at least 55% of its assets, on an unconsolidated basis, consist of qualified assets such as whole loans and whole pool agency certificates, and if at least 80% of its assets, on an unconsolidated basis, are real estate related assets. We will need to ensure not only that we qualify for an exclusion or exemption from regulation under the 1940 Act, but also that each of our subsidiaries qualifies for such an exclusion or exemption. We intend to maintain our exclusion by monitoring the value of our interests in our subsidiaries. We may not be successful in this regard.
 If we fail to maintain our exclusion or secure a different exclusion or exemption if necessary, we may be required to register as an investment company, or we may be required to acquire or dispose of assets in order to meet our exemption. Any such asset acquisitions or dispositions may include assets that we would not acquire or dispose of in the ordinary course of business, may be at unfavorable prices and result in a decline in the price of our common stock. If we are required to register under the 1940 Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act), and portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration and other matters. Accordingly, registration under the 1940 Act could limit our ability to follow our current investment and financing strategies and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.
