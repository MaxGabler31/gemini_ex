Item 1. Business
Overview
We are an Austin, Texas based publicly held company that is in the process of transitioning from an upstream oil and gas exploration and production company into a technology driven oilfield services company offering patented oil and gas technology drilling products designed to improve oil and gas well drilling outcomes.
Prior to entering into the transaction agreement and divestiture described below, we had been focused on the acquisition and development of unconventional resource play opportunities in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas and other strategically important areas that offer predictable economic outcomes and long-lived reserve characteristics. Our asset portfolio included both vertical and horizontal wells in prominent formations such as the Eagle Ford, Austin Chalk, Woodbine, Spraberry, Wolfcamp, Wolfberry, Mississippian, Cline, Fusselman and Ellenberger. As of August 21, 2017, we held a working interest in 30 completed wells located in Texas and New Mexico, predominantly in the Permian Basin of west Texas and the Eagle Ford area of south Texas.
Prior to the divestiture described below, all of our oil and natural gas operations were conducted through Aurora Energy Partners, a two-member Texas partnership, or Aurora. We held all of our oil and natural gas assets through our 50% partnership interest in Aurora. Aurora was a consolidated subsidiary with our company for financial statement purposes. Through our partnership interest in Aurora, we were the beneficial owner of fifty percent (50%) of the oil and gas properties, wells and reserves held of record by Aurora, which was established in January 2008.  The second partner in Aurora was Navitus Energy Group, a Texas general partnership that included four members, or Navitus. Navitus Partners, LLC, one of the Navitus members, raised capital for contribution into to the Aurora partnership, the net proceeds of which were used to fund Aurora’s operations. The investors in this offering received a ten percent (10%) preferred return through their indirect interest in the Navitus partnership for five years and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock for every dollar invested and additional benefits. Under the terms of the offering, Navitus had the right to contribute up to $15 million into Aurora, and our company was obligated to match the capital contribution amount of Navitus resulting from the offering. We were also required to match previous contributions made by Navitus. Under the agreement governing the offering, we could also raise funds from other sources. As of December 31, 2017, Navitus had contributed an aggregate of $10.6 million into Aurora, all of which had earned the rights outlined above.
On August 21, 2017, we entered into a transaction agreement, or the Transaction Agreement, with Armacor Victory Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or AVV, pursuant to which AVV (i) granted to us a worldwide, perpetual, royalty free, fully paid up and exclusive sublicense, or the License, to all of AVV’s owned and licensed intellectual property for use in the oilfield services industry, except for a tubular solutions company headquartered in France, and (ii) agreed to contribute to us $5,000,000, in exchange for which we issued 800,000 shares of our newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, constituting approximately 90% of our issued and outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis and after giving effect to the issuance of the shares and other securities being issued as contemplated by the Transaction Agreement. The closing of the Transaction Agreement also occurred on August 21, 2017. To date, AVV has contributed a total of $255,000 to our company, but has yet to make the entire cash contribution.
In connection with the Transaction Agreement, we entered into an exclusive sublicense agreement with AVV, pursuant to which AVV sublicensed its rights under the License to us, and a trademark license agreement with Liquidmetal Coatings Enterprises, LLC, an affiliate of AVV, or LMCE, pursuant to which LMCE granted a license for the Liquidmetal® Coatings Products and Armacor® trademarks and service marks to us. The Liquidmetal - Armacor product line has been widely tested and down-hole validated by several large U.S. based oil and gas companies, which are currently using the product.
On August 21, 2017, we also entered into a divestiture agreement with Navitus, and on September 14, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the divestiture agreement (which we collectively refer to as the Divestiture Agreement). Pursuant to the Divestiture Agreement, we agreed to divest and transfer our 50% ownership interest in Aurora to Navitus, which owned the remaining 50% interest, in consideration for a release from Navitus of all of our obligations under the second amended partnership agreement, dated October 1, 2011, between us and Navitus, including, without limitation, obligations to return to Navitus investors their accumulated deferred capital, deferred interest and related allocations of equity. We also agreed to (i) issue 4,382,872 shares of our common stock to Navitus and (ii) pay off or otherwise satisfy all indebtedness and other material liabilities of Aurora at or prior to closing of the Divestiture Agreement. We refer to this transaction as the “Divestiture.” Closing of the Divestiture Agreement was completed on December 13, 2017.
Following the Transaction Agreement and the Divestiture of our interests in Aurora, we have begun our transition into a technology driven oilfield services company offering patented oil and gas technology drilling products designed to improve oil and gas well

drilling outcomes. Our products will help achieve this goal by reducing drilling torque, friction, wear resistance, corrosion and other issues that occur during drilling and completion. Our core products will be developed around amorphous alloy technology originally invented by NASA. Amorphous alloys are mechanically stronger and less susceptible to corrosion and wear, because they do not have naturally occurring weak regions or break points of crystalline atomic structure. Metals lacking a crystalline structure possess superior corrosion resistance, hardness, strength and a lower friction coefficient.
Our company will initially embark on a U.S. oilfield services company acquisition initiative, aimed at companies which are already using one or more of the Armacor® brand of Liquidmetal® Coatings Products and/or which are recognized as a high-quality services provider to strategic customers in the major North American oil and gas basins. When completed, each of these oilfield services company acquisitions will provide immediate revenue from their current regional customer base, while also providing us with a foundation for channel distribution and product development of our amorphous alloy technology products. We intend to grow each of these established oilfield services companies by providing better access to capital, more disciplined sales and marketing development, integrated supply chain logistics and infrastructure build out that emphasizes outstanding customer service and customer collaboration, future product development and planning.
We believe that a well-capitalized technology-enabled oilfield services business, with ownership of a worldwide, perpetual, royalty free, fully paid up and exclusive license and rights to all future Liquidmetal® Coatings oil and gas product innovations, will provide the basis for more accessible financing to grow the company and execute our oilfield services company acquisitions strategy. This patent protected intellectual property also creates a meaningfully differentiated oilfield services business, with little effective competition. The combination of friction reduction, torque reduction, reduced corrosion, wear and better data collection from the deployment of our RFID enclosures, only represent our initial product line. We anticipate new innovative products will come to market as we collaborate with drillers to solve their other down-hole needs.
Our Corporate History
Our company was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 7, 1982 under the name All Things Inc. On March 21, 1985, our company’s name was changed to New Environmental Technologies Corporation. On April 28, 2003, our company’s name was changed to Victory Capital Holdings Corporation. On May 3, 2006, our company’s name was changed to Victory Energy Corporation.
From inception until 2004, we had no material business operations. In 2004, we began the search for the acquisition of assets, property or businesses that could benefit our Company and its stockholders. In 2005, management determined that we should focus on projects in the oil and gas industry.
In January 2008, we and Navitus established Aurora. Prior to the Divesture described below, our company was the managing partner of Aurora and held a 50% partnership interest in Aurora. All of our oil and natural gas operations were conducted through Aurora.
Transaction Agreement
On August 21, 2017, we entered into the Transaction Agreement with AVV, pursuant to which AVV (i) granted to us a worldwide, perpetual, royalty free, fully paid up and exclusive sublicense, or the License, to all of AVV’s owned and licensed intellectual property for use in the oilfield services industry, except for a tubular solutions company headquartered in France, and (ii) agreed to contribute to us $5,000,000, or the Cash Contribution, in exchange for which we issued 800,000 shares of our newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, constituting approximately 90% of our issued and outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis and after giving effect to the issuance of the shares and other securities being issued as contemplated by the Transaction Agreement. The closing of the Transaction Agreement also occurred on August 21, 2017.
In connection with the Transaction Agreement, we entered into an exclusive sublicense agreement with AVV, pursuant to which AVV granted the License to us, and a trademark license agreement with LMCE, pursuant to which LCME granted a license for the Liquidmetal® Coatings Products and Armacor® trademarks and service marks to us. The Liquidmetal - Armacor product line has been widely tested and down-hole validated by several large U.S. based oil and gas companies, which are currently using the product.
Payment of the entire Cash Contribution was to be made by AVV within three (3) business days following stockholder approval of certain amendments to our articles of incorporation and our satisfaction of certain other conditions specified in the Transaction Agreement. These conditions were satisfied by our company effective November 24, 2017. To date, AVV has contributed a total of $255,000 to our company, but has yet to make the entire Cash Contribution.

Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, since AVV failed to make the full Cash Contribution when due, we may, in our sole discretion, seek up to $5 million of equity capital from other sources, including, without limitation, from Visionary Private Equity Group I, LP, a Missouri limited partnership, or VPEG, its affiliates and designees under the option granted to VPEG pursuant to the loan agreement described below. Also, since AVV failed to make the entire Cash Contribution when due, we may (upon notice described below) cancel a number of the shares issued to AVV in accordance with the following formula:
Cancelled Shares = X% of 213,333
For purposes of the foregoing formula:
X=     (A - B)/A
A=     5,000,000
B=     the amount of the Cash Contribution funded by AVV
Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances shall the number of shares be reduced to less than 586,667 shares without AVV’s prior written consent.
The above cancellation shall be made at such time as we have reasonably determined that AVV will not be able to fund any additional amounts under the Cash Contribution and we notify AVV of the same in writing upon thirty (30) days prior written notice.
Loan Agreement
On August 21, 2017, in connection with the Transaction Agreement, we entered into a loan agreement, or the VPEG Loan Agreement, with VPEG, pursuant to which VPEG loaned $500,000 to us. Such loan is evidenced by a secured convertible original issue discount promissory note, or the VPEG Note, issued by us to VPEG on August 21, 2017. The VPEG Note reflects an original issue discount of $50,000 such that the principal amount of the VPEG Note is $550,000, notwithstanding the fact that the loan is in the amount of $500,000. The VPEG Note does not bear any interest in addition to the original issue discount, matures on September 1, 2017, and is secured by a security interest in all of our assets.
On October 11, 2017, we and VPEG entered into an amendment to the VPEG Loan Agreement and VPEG Note, pursuant to which the parties agreed to (i) increase the loan amount to $565,000, (ii) increase the principal amount of the VPEG Note to $621,500, reflecting an original issue discount of $56,500 and (iii) extend the maturity date to November 30, 2017.
On January 17, 2018, we and VPEG entered into a second amendment to the VPEG Loan Agreement and VPEG Note, pursuant to which the parties agreed (i) to extend the maturity date to a date that is five business days following VPEG’s written demand for payment on the VPEG Note; (ii) that VPEG will have the option but not the obligation to loan us additional amounts under the VPEG Note on the same terms upon the written request from us; and (iii) that, in the event that VPEG exercises its option to convert the note into shares of our common stock at any time after the maturity date and prior to payment in full of the principal amount of the VPEG Note, we shall issue to VPEG a five year warrant to purchase a number of additional shares of common stock equal to the number of shares issuable upon such conversion, at an exercise price of $1.52 per share, and containing a cashless exercise feature and such other provisions as mutually agreed to by us and VPEG.
VPEG has the right, exercisable at any time from and after the maturity date and prior to payment in full, to convert all or any portion of the principal amount then outstanding, plus all accrued but unpaid interest at the Default Interest Rate (as described below), into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to $1.52 per share, subject to adjustment.
The VPEG Note contains standard events of default, including: (i) if we shall default in the payment of the principal amount as and when the same shall become due and payable, whether by acceleration or otherwise; or (ii) if we shall default in any material manner in the observance or performance of any covenants or agreements set forth in the VPEG Note or the VPEG Loan Agreement; or (iii) if we shall: (a) admit in writing our inability to pay our debts as they become due; (b) apply for, consent to, or acquiesce in, the appointment of a trustee, receiver, sequestrator or other custodian for our company or any of its property, or make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (c) in the absence of such application, consent or acquiesce in, permit or suffer to exist the appointment of a trustee, receiver, sequestrator or other custodian for our company or for any part of its property; or (d) permit or suffer to exist the commencement of any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement or other case or proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any dissolution, winding up or liquidation proceeding (each referred to as an Event of Default). Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, interest upon the unpaid principal amount shall begin to accrue at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) eight percent (8%) per annum or (ii) the maximum interest rate allowed from time to time under applicable law (referred 
8

to as the Default Interest Rate), and shall continue at the Default Interest Rate until the Event of Default is cured or full payment is made of the unpaid principal amount.
Under the VPEG Loan Agreement, if AVV fails to satisfy its obligation to make all or any portion of the Cash Contribution under the Transaction Agreement, then VPEG or its affiliates or designees has the option, in its sole discretion, to fund the shortfall up to the full amount of the Cash Contribution. In consideration for making such investment VPEG or its affiliates or designees shall receive (i) a number of shares of our common stock that is equal to the quotient of the total investment amount divided by $1.52 and (ii) a five year warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $1.52 for each share of common stock issued to VPEG or its affiliates or designees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, VPEG shall only be permitted to exercise this option if no third party that is ready, willing and able to fund our company has made a written proposal to fund our company on terms that are more favorable to our company than the terms described above; provided; however, that if any such third party makes a more favorable proposal, then VPEG shall have the right, but not the obligation, to invest in our company on such more favorable terms up to the entire amount of such third party financing. For the avoidance of doubt, if such third party financing is in an amount less than the entire amount of the Cash Contribution, then VPEG will continue to have the option to invest in our company on the option terms in an amount up to the entire amount of the Cash Contribution and the amount of the proposed third party financing.
Settlement Agreements
On August 21, 2017, in connection with the Transaction Agreement, we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with VPEG, pursuant to which all obligations of our company to VPEG to repay indebtedness for borrowed money (other than the VPEG Note), which totaled $873,409.64, including all accrued, but unpaid, interest thereon, was converted into 110,000.472149068 shares of our newly designated Series C Preferred Stock.

Our Corporate Structure
Following the Divestiture of Aurora, we do not have any subsidiaries. All of our operations are conducted by our company.
Our Industry and Market
The following information excerpts were sourced from a March 2017 Analysis Report published by Grand View Research, for the Oil and Gas Corrosion Protection Market (REPORT ID: GVR-1-68038-713-1). The full report can be purchased by visiting www.grandviewresearch.com.
The global oil & gas corrosion protection market size was estimated at USD 8.01 billion in 2015 and is expected to experience significant growth over the forecast period, primarily owing to the rising need for transportation and supply infrastructure in oil and gas industry. The global market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 4.3% from 2016 - 2025 to reach $12.22 billion by 2025. This growth can be attributed to the additional benefits such as durability and toughness offered by epoxy based coatings. North America and the Middle East and Africa together account for more than half of the global market size. Rapid infrastructural development and technological advancements in the oil and gas sector are expected to further fuel the demand over the forecast period.
The market has been segmented into different types such as coatings, paints, inhibitors and others. The coatings segment accounted for the highest share globally with revenue of $2.86 billion in 2015 and is expected to remain the largest segment by 2025. Coatings made from various materials including epoxy, alkyd, polyurethanes and acrylic are used on pipelines and other components. Various factors considered in the formulation of epoxy resin based coatings include metal type, rate of flow, viscosity, flammability and physical location.
The regional market is mainly dominated by North America and the Middle East and Africa, with the presence of major oil and gas exploration markets such as the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Government initiatives coupled with infrastructural developments in these countries are further propelling the growth of the market in these regions.
Sector Insights
The upstream sector of the oil and gas industry involves activities such as exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. These activities primarily include drilling of exploratory wells, making requisite operations and bringing natural gas and other products to the ground surface. For these activities, various components require protection as they get older. Carbon steel is extensively used in this industry especially for pipelines and it gets freely corrodes when it comes into contact with water, which is produced with the natural gas and crude oil from underwater reservoirs.
10

The midstream sector consists of transportation activity of crude oil and natural gas. These products are transported by various medium including pipelines, tankers, tank cars, and trucks. The outer surface of the tanks or pipelines is prevented from the atmospheric corrosion with the help of coatings and cathodic protection.
In the downstream sector, during the refinery operations, most of the corrosion occurs due to the presence of water, H2S, CO2, sodium chloride and sulfuric acid. In downstream, deterioration occurs due to curing agents those are present in crude oil or feedstock and are associated with process or control. To prevent such corrosion, various products including coatings, inhibitors, cathodic protection and paints are used.
Regional Insights
North America and the Middle East and African regions are projected to contribute to market growth in coming years primarily fueled by the need for transportation/supply infrastructure and technological innovations for the corrosion detection in various countries including the U.S., Canada, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and others. The applications in oil & gas sector such upstream, midstream and downstream have been experiencing significant growth in these countries over the past few years.
Our Products and Services
In today’s harsher drilling environment, exploration and productions companies are seeking new methods and technologies for reducing drill-string torque and down-hole friction when drilling long laterals. Without a comprehensive solution, drill pipe, tubing, tool joints and drill string mid-sections will suffer from aggressive wear that will negatively impact drilling torque, friction, time to complete and total drilling costs. Our Armacor® line of products will solve these problems with revolutionary amorphous alloys. Our alloys are mechanically much stronger, harder and corrosion resistant than crystalline structure alloys found in in the market today. Our goal is to help drillers across the major oil and gas basins of North America create better oil and gas well outcomes and lower total well costs when drilling long laterals. Our initial product line will be focused on tubing and drill-pipe metal coating products, RFID enclosure products and other services that provide protection and friction reduction for nearly every metal component of a drilling operation.
With hardness that can range from 900 to 1500 Vickers, our coatings products will be 3 to 5 times harder than normal metals such as titanium and steel. Oilfield products protected by these Armacor® coatings are lasting two to ten times longer than other coated products in field applications. Additionally, our coatings products will deliver a friction coefficient of 0.05 to 0.12, similar to the smoothness of Teflon.
Our Competitors
The key players in the global market include The 3M Company, AkzoNobel N.V, Jotun A/S, Hempel A/S, Axalta Coating System Ltd., The Sherwin-Williams Company, Kansai Paints Co. Ltd., RPM International, Inc., Aegion Corporation, Ashland Inc., and BASF SE. The industry is characterized by merger and acquisitions as the players are focusing on increasing their market presence.
