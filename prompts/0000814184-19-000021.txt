Item 1. Business
General
TCF Financial Corporation (together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, "we," "us," "our," "TCF" or the "Company"), a Delaware corporation incorporated on April 28,1987, is a national bank holding company based in Wayzata, Minnesota. References herein to "TCF Financial" or the "Holding Company" refer to TCF Financial Corporation on an unconsolidated basis. Its principal subsidiary, TCF National Bank ("TCF Bank"), is headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. TCF Bank operates bank branches in Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Colorado, Wisconsin, Arizona and South Dakota (TCF's "primary banking markets"). Through its direct subsidiaries, TCF Bank provides a full range of consumer-facing and commercial services, including consumer banking services in 47 states, commercial banking services in 42 states, commercial leasing and equipment financing in all 50 states and, to a limited extent, in foreign countries and commercial inventory financing in all 50 states and Canada and, to a limited extent, in other foreign countries. 
TCF provides convenient financial services through multiple channels in its primary banking markets. TCF has developed products and services designed to meet the specific needs of the largest consumer segments in the market. The Company focuses on attracting and retaining customers through an exceptional customer experience driven by convenience through multiple points of contact, including digital banking, phone banking, a branch presence with select locations open at least six days a week and with extended hours, and access to automated teller machine ("ATM") networks. TCF's philosophy is to generate interest income, fees and other revenue growth through business lines that emphasize higher yielding assets and low interest cost deposits. TCF's growth strategies include organic growth in existing businesses, development of new products and services, new customer acquisition and acquisitions of portfolios or businesses. New products and services are designed to build on existing businesses and expand into complementary products and services through strategic initiatives. Funded generally through retail deposit generation, TCF continues to focus on profitable asset growth.
TCF generated total revenue, defined as net interest income plus total non-interest income, of $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. TCF had total assets of $23.7 billion at December 31, 2018 and was the 49th largest publicly traded bank holding company in the United States based on total assets at September 30, 2018. 
On January 28, 2019, TCF entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Chemical Financial Corporation ("Chemical"), a bank holding company with $21.5 billion in assets, headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. The merger is expected to close in late 2019, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of TCF and Chemical. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, each outstanding share of TCF common stock will be converted into the right to receive, without interest, 0.5081 shares of Chemical common stock. Also, at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of the 5.70% Series C non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock of TCF will be converted into the right to receive, without interest, one share of a newly created series of preferred stock of Chemical with equivalent rights and preferences (the "New Chemical Preferred Stock"). The shares of Chemical common stock and the New Chemical Preferred Stock to be issued in the merger will be listed on the Nasdaq. Following the completion of the merger, TCF and Chemical shareholders will own approximately 54% and 46% of the combined company, respectively, on a fully diluted basis. 
Effective April 1, 2017, the Company executed its strategic shift from an originate-to-sell and originate-to-hold model to an entirely originate-to-hold model for its auto finance business and effective December 1, 2017, the Company discontinued auto finance loan originations. The determination was based on management's review of strategic alternatives and the financial outlook of the auto finance loan origination business compared with alternative uses of capital. TCF's subsidiary, Gateway One Lending & Finance, LLC ("Gateway One"), continues to service existing auto loans on its balance sheet and those that are serviced for others. The decision to discontinue auto finance loan originations resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $73.0 million, an other intangible assets impairment charge of $0.4 million and approximately $14.8 million of expenses related to severance, other asset impairments and lease termination expenses in 2017. 
The Company's reportable segments are Consumer Banking, Wholesale Banking and Enterprise Services. 
1

Consumer Banking
Consumer Banking is comprised of all of the Company's consumer-facing businesses and includes retail banking, consumer real estate and other, and auto finance. TCF's consumer banking strategy is primarily to generate deposits and originate high credit quality secured consumer real estate loans for investment and for sale. Deposits are generated from consumers and small businesses to provide a source of low cost funds, with a focus on building and maintaining quality customer relationships. 
Retail Banking TCF offers an array of solutions for consumers and small businesses through its physical and digital distribution channels. TCF offers a broad selection of deposit and lending services including (i) checking and savings accounts, (ii) credit and debit cards, (iii) check cashing and remittance services and (iv) residential, consumer and small business lending.
Deposits are the primary source of TCF's funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes. Deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates, market and competitive conditions and other economic factors. Deposits are acquired from within TCF's primary banking markets through (i) checking, savings and money market accounts, (ii) certificates of deposit and (iii) individual retirement accounts. Such deposit accounts provide fee income, including fees and service charges. 
At December 31, 2018, TCF had 314 branches, consisting of 189 traditional branches, 122 supermarket branches and three campus branches. TCF operates 120 branches in Illinois, 85 in Minnesota, 50 in Michigan, 33 in Colorado, 17 in Wisconsin, seven in Arizona and two in South Dakota. TCF also offers 845 ATMs across TCF's primary banking markets. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for further information regarding the risks related to TCF's supermarket branch relationships.
Providing a wide range of retail banking services is an integral component of TCF's business philosophy. Primary drivers of fees and service charges include the number of customers we attract, the customers' level of engagement and the frequency with which the customer uses our solutions. TCF's business philosophy is to offer our customers an "easy-to-bank-with" experience, with multiple solutions that benefit the customer and are consistent with TCF's business philosophy. Customers have convenient access to their funds through their credit and debit cards, as well as by utilizing TCF's enhanced digital channels. TCF's card programs are supported by interchange fees paid by retailers. 
Consumer Real Estate and Other  TCF originates consumer loans for personal, family or household purposes, such as home purchases, debt consolidation and financing of home improvements. TCF's retail lending origination activity primarily consists of consumer real estate secured lending. It also includes originating loans secured by personal property and, to a limited extent, unsecured personal loans. Consumer loans are originated for investment and for sale, either on a fixed-term basis or as a revolving line of credit. TCF's junior lien lending business is a national platform focused on originating junior lien loans to high credit quality customers. TCF Home Loans, a division of TCF Bank, originates first mortgage lien loans in our primary banking markets. TCF has two consumer real estate loan sale programs: one that sells the nationally originated consumer real estate junior lien loans and one that sells the first mortgage lien loans through correspondent relationships. TCF does not have any consumer real estate subprime lending programs. 
Auto Finance Gateway One services existing loans on new and used autos on its balance sheet and those that are serviced for others. 
Wholesale Banking
Wholesale Banking is comprised of commercial banking, leasing and equipment finance, and inventory finance. TCF's wholesale banking strategy is primarily to originate high credit quality secured loans and leases for investment.
Commercial  With an emphasis on secured lending, essentially all of TCF's commercial loans were secured either by properties or other business assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
2

Commercial real estate loans originated by TCF are primarily secured by commercial real estate, including multi-family housing, office buildings, health care facilities, warehouse and industrial buildings, hotel and motel buildings, self-storage buildings and retail services buildings. The commercial real estate portfolio represented 75.5% and 77.3% of TCF's total commercial portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Commercial business loans originated by TCF are secured by various types of business assets including inventory, receivables, equipment or financial instruments. Commercial business loans are used for a variety of purposes, including working capital and financing the purchase of equipment. 
Leasing and Equipment Finance TCF provides a broad range of comprehensive lease and equipment finance products addressing the diverse financing needs of small to large companies in a growing number of select market segments including specialty vehicles, construction equipment, golf cart and turf equipment, manufacturing equipment, medical equipment, trucks and trailers, furniture and fixtures, technology and data processing equipment, and agricultural equipment. TCF's leasing and equipment finance businesses are TCF Equipment Finance, a division of TCF Bank, and Winthrop Resources Corporation ("Winthrop"). TCF Equipment Finance delivers equipment finance solutions primarily to small and mid-size companies in various industries with significant diversity in the types of underlying equipment. Winthrop focuses on providing customized lease financing to meet the special needs of mid-size and large companies and health care facilities that procure high-tech essential business equipment such as computers, servers, telecommunication equipment, medical equipment and other technology equipment.
Inventory Finance TCF Inventory Finance, Inc. ("TCF Inventory Finance") originates commercial, primarily variable-rate loans which are secured by the underlying floorplan equipment and supported by repurchase agreements from original equipment manufacturers. The operation focuses on establishing relationships with distributors, dealer buying groups and manufacturers, giving TCF access to thousands of independent retailers primarily in the areas of powersports equipment and lawn and garden equipment. TCF Inventory Finance's portfolio balances are impacted by seasonal shipments and sales activities as dealers receive inventory shipments in anticipation of the upcoming selling season while carrying current season product. In 2009, TCF Inventory Finance formed a joint venture with The Toro Company ("Toro") called Red Iron Acceptance, LLC ("Red Iron"). Red Iron provides U.S. distributors and dealers and select Canadian distributors of the Toro® and Exmark® brands with reliable, cost-effective sources of financing. TCF maintains a 55% ownership interest in Red Iron, with Toro owning the other 45%.
Enterprise Services
Enterprise Services is comprised of (i) corporate treasury, which includes the Company's investment and borrowing portfolios and management of capital, debt and market risks, (ii) corporate functions, such as information technology, risk and credit management, bank operations, finance, investor relations, corporate development, internal audit, legal and human capital management that provide services to the operating segments, (iii) the Holding Company and (iv) eliminations. The Company's investment portfolio accounts for the earning assets within this segment. Borrowings may be used to offset reductions in deposits or to support lending activities. This segment also includes residual revenues and expenses representing the difference between actual amounts incurred by Enterprise Services and amounts allocated to the operating segments, including interest rate risk residuals such as funds transfer pricing mismatches.
Corporate Treasury Corporate treasury's primary responsibility is management of liquidity, capital, interest rate risk, and investment and borrowing portfolios. Corporate treasury has authority to invest in various types of liquid assets including, but not limited to, U.S. Department of the Treasury obligations and debt securities of various federal agencies and U.S. Government sponsored enterprises, obligations of states and political subdivisions, deposits of insured banks, bankers' acceptances and federal funds. Corporate treasury also has the authority to enter into wholesale borrowing transactions which may be used to compensate for reductions in deposit inflows or net deposit outflows, or to support lending, leasing and other expansion activities. These borrowings may include Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances, brokered deposits, repurchase agreements, federal funds and other permitted borrowings from counterparties.

Other Information
Activities of Subsidiaries of TCF TCF's business operations include those conducted by direct and indirect subsidiaries of TCF Financial, all of which are consolidated for purposes of preparing TCF's consolidated financial statements. TCF Bank's subsidiaries principally engage in leasing, inventory finance and auto finance activities. See "Consumer Banking" and "Wholesale Banking" above for further information.
Competition  TCF competes with a number of depository institutions and financial service providers primarily based on price and service and faces significant competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in lending activities. Direct competition for deposits comes primarily from banks, savings institutions, credit unions and investment banks. Additional significant competition for deposits comes from institutions selling money market mutual funds and corporate and government securities. TCF competes for the origination of loans with banks, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, consumer and commercial finance companies, credit unions, insurance companies and savings institutions. TCF also competes nationwide with other companies and banks in the financing of equipment and inventory, leasing of equipment and origination of consumer real estate junior lien loans. The growth of financial technology companies partnering with financial services providers has increased competition for loan, lease and deposit products.
Employees As of December 31, 2018, TCF had 5,544 employees, including 698 part-time employees. TCF provides its employees with comprehensive benefits, some of which are provided on a contributory basis, including medical and dental plans, a 401(k) savings plan with a company matching contribution, life insurance and short- and long-term disability coverage.
Regulation
TCF Financial, as a publicly held bank holding company, and TCF Bank, which has deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), are subject to extensive regulation. Among other things, TCF Financial and TCF Bank are subject to minimum capital requirements, lending and deposit restrictions and numerous other requirements. TCF Financial's primary regulator is the Federal Reserve and TCF Bank's primary regulator is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"). TCF's consumer products are also regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB").

Regulatory Capital Requirements TCF Financial and TCF Bank are subject to various minimum regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. These requirements include quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items, as well as define and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possible additional discretionary, actions by the federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material adverse effect on TCF's financial condition and results of operations. These federal banking regulators are required by law to take prompt action when institutions are viewed as engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or do not meet certain minimum capital requirements. In addition to other potential actions, failure to meet these requirements would result in limitations on capital distributions as well as executive bonuses. The Basel III capital standards allowed institutions not subject to the advanced approaches requirements to opt out of including components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in common equity Tier 1 capital. TCF and TCF Bank made the one-time permanent election to not include accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in regulatory capital. TCF and TCF Bank are subject to a capital conservation buffer. As of January 1, 2019, the Basel III capital standard requires TCF and TCF Bank to maintain a 2.5% capital conservation buffer, designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, resulting in minimum ratios for TCF Bank of (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.5% and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.5%. TCF and TCF Bank exceeded the Basel III capital standard at December 31, 2018. See Note 16.  Regulatory Capital Requirements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Restrictions on Distributions  TCF Financial's ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations imposed by the Federal Reserve. In general, Federal Reserve regulatory guidelines require the board of directors of a bank holding company to consider a number of factors in determining the payment of dividends, including the quality and level of current and future earnings. Restricted retained earnings represents earnings legally appropriated to thrift bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes in prior years and is generally not available for payment of cash dividends or other distributions to stockholders. See Note 15. Equity of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on restricted retained earnings.

Dividends or other capital distributions from TCF Bank to TCF Financial are an important source of funds to enable TCF Financial to pay dividends on its preferred and common stock, to pay TCF Financial's obligations, to repurchase common stock or to meet other cash needs. The ability of TCF Financial and TCF Bank to pay dividends depends on regulatory policies and regulatory capital requirements and may be subject to regulatory approval.

In general, TCF Bank may not declare or pay a dividend to TCF Financial in excess of 100% of its net retained earnings for the current year combined with its net retained earnings for the preceding two calendar years without prior approval of the OCC. The OCC also has the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a national bank when it determines such payments would constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice. TCF Bank's ability to make capital distributions in the future may require regulatory approval and may be restricted by its federal banking regulators. TCF Bank's ability to make any such distributions will also depend on its earnings and ability to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements in effect during future periods. In the future, these capital adequacy standards may be higher than existing minimum regulatory capital requirements. See Note 16. Regulatory Capital Requirements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
In addition, income tax considerations may limit the ability of TCF Bank to make dividend payments in excess of its current and accumulated tax earnings. Annual dividend distributions in excess of earnings could result in a tax liability based on the amount of excess earnings distributed and current tax rates.
Regulation of TCF and Affiliates and Insider Transactions  TCF Financial is subject to Federal Reserve regulations, examinations and reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. Subsidiaries of bank holding companies, like TCF Bank, are subject to certain restrictions in their dealings with holding company affiliates.

A holding company must serve as a source of strength for its subsidiary banks and the Federal Reserve may require a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. In addition, the OCC may assess TCF Financial if it believes the capital of TCF Bank has become impaired. If TCF Financial were to fail to pay such an assessment within three months, the Board of Directors would be required to cause the sale of TCF Bank's stock to cover a deficiency in the capital. In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and may be entitled to priority over other creditors.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the "BHCA"), Federal Reserve approval is required before acquiring more than 5% control, or substantially all of the assets, of another bank or bank holding company, or merging or consolidating with such a bank or bank holding company. The BHCA also generally prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, providing services for its subsidiaries or conducting activities permitted by the Federal Reserve as being closely related to the business of banking. Further restrictions or limitations on acquisitions or establishing financial subsidiaries may also be imposed by TCF's regulators or examiners.
Restrictions on Acquisitions and Changes in Control  Under federal and state law, merger and branch acquisition transactions may be subject to certain restrictions, including certain nationwide and statewide insured deposit maximum concentration levels or other limitations. In addition, federal and state laws and regulations contain a number of provisions which impose restrictions on changes in control of financial institutions such as TCF Bank and which require regulatory approval prior to any such changes in control.
Insurance of Accounts  TCF Bank is a member of the FDIC, which maintains the Deposit Insurance Fund (the "DIF"). The FDIC insures deposits up to prescribed limits for each depositor through the DIF, which is funded through assessments on member institutions. To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") gave the FDIC much greater discretion to manage the DIF and also changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to average total assets less tangible equity. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act raised the minimum designated reserve ratio (the "DRR") to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits from 1.15% and required this new minimum be reached by September 30, 2020. From July 1, 2016 to October 1, 2018, an additional surcharge of 4.5 cents for each $100 of an institution's assessment base in excess of $10.0 billion was assessed to ensure the DRR reached this new minimum by the required date. The DIF ratio calculated by the FDIC using estimated insured deposits as of September 30, 2018 was 1.36%. 
5

In 2018, insurance premiums on bank deposits insured by the FDIC for banks with at least $10.0 billion in total assets ranged from 1.5 cents to 40 cents per $100 of the institution's assessment base. TCF's FDIC insurance expense was $15.1 million, $16.0 million and $15.9 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
In addition to deposit insurance premium assessments from the FDIC, additional assessments may be imposed by the Financing Corporation, a separate U.S. government agency affiliated with the FDIC, to pay for the interest cost of Financing Corporation bonds. As of December 31, 2018, the Financing Corporation assessment rate was 14 cents for each $10,000 of the institution's assessment base.
Examinations and Regulatory Sanctions  TCF is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the CFPB and the FDIC. Federal banking regulators may impose a number of restrictions or new requirements on institutions, including, but not limited to, growth limitations, dividend restrictions, increased regulatory capital requirements, increased loan and lease loss reserve requirements, increased supervisory assessments, activity limitations or other restrictions that could have an adverse effect on such institutions, their holding companies or holders of their debt and equity securities. Various enforcement remedies, including civil money penalties, may be assessed against an institution or an institution's directors, officers, employees, agents or independent contractors. Certain enforcement actions may not be publicly disclosed by TCF or its federal banking regulators. Subsidiaries of TCF Bank are also subject to state and/or self-regulatory organization licensing, regulation and examination requirements in connection with certain activities. 
National Bank Investment Limitations  Permissible investments by national banks are limited by the National Bank Act of 1864, as amended, and by rules of the OCC. Non-traditional bank activities permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 will subject a bank to additional regulatory limitations or requirements, including a required regulatory capital deduction and application of transactions with affiliates limitations in connection with such activities.
Taxation 
Federal Taxation  TCF's federal income tax returns are open and subject to examination for 2015 and later tax return years. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform"), enacted on December 22, 2017, TCF recorded a reasonable estimate of a net tax benefit of $130.7 million in 2017, primarily resulting from the re-measurement of the Company's estimated net deferred tax liability. TCF recorded an additional net tax benefit of $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2018 for the finalization of the provisional amounts recorded in 2017.
State Taxation  TCF and/or its subsidiaries currently file tax returns in all state and local taxing jurisdictions which impose corporate income, franchise or other taxes. TCF's various state income tax returns are generally open for 2014 and later tax return years based on individual state statutes of limitation. The methods of filing and the methods for calculating taxable and apportionable income vary depending on the laws of each taxing jurisdiction. 
Foreign Taxation TCF and/or its subsidiaries currently file tax returns in Canada and certain Canadian provinces which impose corporate income taxes. TCF's various foreign income tax returns are open and subject to examination for 2014 and later tax return years. The methods of filing and the methods for calculating taxable and apportionable income vary depending on the laws of each taxing jurisdiction.
