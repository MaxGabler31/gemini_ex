Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
Since Yelp's founding 17 years ago, our mission has remained the same — to connect consumers with great local businesses. Over that time, we have built one of the best-known internet brands in the United States. Consumers trust us for our more than 220 million ratings and reviews of businesses across a broad range of categories. This consumer trust is the foundation of our business, from which we are able to empower other businesses to succeed. Our advertising products help businesses of all sizes reach a large audience, advertise their products and drive conversion of their services. We believe our ability to provide value to both consumers and businesses positions us well in the local, digital advertising market in the United States. 
In 2019, we announced an ambitious, multi-year business transformation plan designed to drive and sustain long-term profitable growth through product innovation rather than local sales headcount. Our performance in 2021 — which included record revenue and profitable growth despite a difficult operating environment — demonstrates that the initiatives we began in 2019 successfully transformed Yelp into a stronger, more efficient and product-led business. Through consistent execution and an elevated pace of product innovation, we delivered on our 2021 initiatives to:
Improve Monetization of Our Services Categories
•In 2021, we focused on building increasingly differentiated product experiences for both consumers and businesses in our Services categories — home, local, auto, professional, pets, events, real estate and financial services — as well as increasing monetization in these categories. We launched several new Services products, such as Cost Guides, which help consumers make informed decisions when hiring service professionals, and Themed Ads, which enable advertisers to better compete by highlighting their ads in a carousel on the search results page based on differentiating attributes, such as “fast responding.”
•Products like Cost Guides and Themed Ads, as well as new custom search filters, help better match consumers with the right Services businesses for their projects, increasing the value of leads and driving monetization. In 2021, the percentage of monetized leads in our Services categories — consisting of calls, requests and URL clicks — increased to 25% in 2021 from approximately 20% in 2020 and less than 10% in 2018 (the year before we adopted this initiative). As a result of these efforts, we achieved record average revenue per paying advertising location in Services categories in 2021.
Expand Our Self-Serve and Multi-location Channels
•Through investments in product, our national, mid-market and franchise (“Multi-location”) business, and marketing, we have significantly shifted our go-to-market mix in recent years toward our most efficient channels, allowing us to surpass our 2019 revenue in 2021 with a significantly smaller local sales force. In 2021, our Self-serve channel, together with our more-tenured local sales force, both acquired small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) more efficiently and exhibited a higher retention rate than our pre-pandemic local sales force. Improvements to the claim and ads purchase flows as well as marketing investments drove record Self-serve customer acquisition and strong retention in 2021. As a result, revenue from our Self-serve channel reached a new record in 2021 and increased as a percentage of advertising revenue to 17%, up from 13% in 2020 and 10% in 2019.
•Similarly, developing customer relationships and introducing new Multi-location products resulted in record revenue in 2021 from this channel as well. As our sales team helped these high-value clients navigate the pandemic as well as labor and supply chain headwinds, we introduced products such as Seasonal Spotlight Ads and Sponsored Collections, expanded our first-party attribution solution, Yelp Store Visits, and fully launched our off-platform solution, Yelp Audiences. Yelp Audiences in particular increased our market opportunity by enabling multi-platform brand awareness campaigns and providing non-location based advertisers with access to our audience. As a result of these efforts, Multi-location channel revenue increased as a percentage of total advertising revenue to 27% from 25% in 2020 and 24% in 2019.
Deliver More Value to Advertisers
•In addition to the many new ad formats we launched in 2021, we also delivered more value to advertisers through improvements to our advertising system in the form of both front-end merchandising and user interface enhancements as well as back-end optimizations to improve matching and targeting. Although traffic remained impacted by ongoing concerns related to COVID-19 and its variants, ad clicks increased by 24% and average CPC decreased by 5% from 2020, contributing to a record annual retention rate for non-term advertiser budgets (our “NTC retention rate”).
Reduce Costs by Operating on a Distributed Basis
•In 2021, we announced our decision to remain working on a distributed basis permanently. In addition to the savings from our smaller local sales force and other efficiencies resulting from our growth initiatives, our distributed operations have allowed us to operate with significantly less office space than prior to the pandemic, helping us achieve positive net income and a record annual adjusted EBITDA margin in 2021. We executed a number of office space reductions over the course of 2021, including reducing our office space in Phoenix, relocating our San Francisco and Washington, DC offices to smaller spaces, and subleasing portions of our remaining office space in San Francisco and New York.
Our Long-term Growth Opportunity is Large
We believe we are well positioned in the large and growing local, digital advertising market. The competitive advantages we have established over the past 17 years, together with our structurally more efficient, product-led business model, provide us with the opportunity for consistent, long-term growth in this market. We have:
•A proven engine to generate and recommend trusted content. Our platform provides the type of reliable and useful review content that consumers value, which is the basis for a positive feedback loop in which more content attracts more users, content and advertisers in turn. The breadth and depth of our high-quality content is the result of our significant investments over the past 17 years in developing both communities of contributors as well as providing a great consumer experience that enables and encourages consumers to share their everyday business experiences through reviews, photos and other content. We have also developed industry-leading content moderation practices to maintain the quality and integrity of our content. For example, our recommendation software and other machine learning algorithms are designed to surface the most useful and trustworthy information on our platform for consumers. This technology, together with content moderation by our User Operations team and other consumer protection efforts, helps us detect and mitigate attempts to manipulate ratings and reviews. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 71% of the reviews submitted to our platform were recommended.
•A strong brand and a large consumer audience. Our trusted content has attracted a large, high-intent consumer audience. This large audience of engaged consumers reflects the strength of our brand as the go-to source for reliable local business information as well as our availability across a wide range of platforms and devices. It also provides a compelling value proposition to advertisers. In addition to its size, our audience has high purchase intent and is generally affluent — we estimate that over 50% of our audience has annual household income of more than $100,000.
•A broad-based local advertising platform and sophisticated advertising technology. Our large consumer audience supports a broad-based advertising model with products designed to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes. Our portfolio of products and attribution capabilities leverage first-party data to provide advertising solutions across categories and each stage of the consumer funnel, both on and off platform. These products are backed by a scaled and extensible advertising technology platform. To establish the price of an individual ad click on our platform, we run an auction for each advertising unit displayed to a consumer on our website or mobile app, which resulted in an average of 20 million auctions per day in 2021. The bidding algorithms used in our auction system are designed to prioritize spending advertiser budgets efficiently and maximize ad clicks to optimize the value we deliver to advertisers, while our proprietary ad delivery technology is designed to determine the most relevant ads to display to consumers to drive fulfillment. 
Our Growth and Margin Strategy
We believe that the strategic initiatives that have transformed our business continue to provide significant opportunities for growth. At the same time, the significant progress we have achieved has positioned us to expand our focus on the consumer experience. In 2022, we plan to continue elevating the Yelp experience for consumers, business owners and advertisers by focusing our product investments in the areas set forth below. We believe each of these investment priorities represents its own long-term opportunity and together will drive long-term sustainable and profitable growth.
Revenue Growth
•Grow quality leads and monetization of our Services categories. Although we have made significant progress on increasing the percentage of monetized leads in our Services categories in recent years, the substantial majority of leads in these categories remain unmonetized. As a result, we believe that our large and high-intent consumer audience positions us well to capture more of the significant opportunity that the advertising market for Services businesses represents. Because the needs of both consumers and businesses in our Services categories are generally distinct from those in our Restaurants, Retail and Other categories — restaurants, shopping, beauty & fitness, health and other — we continue to believe that differentiating the Services experience on Yelp will allow us to both monetize more of our consumer traffic and convert more Services businesses into advertisers. In 2022, we also plan to explore adjacent opportunities to improve the experience for consumers and Services businesses by improving lead quality as well as the distribution of leads to match more consumers with the right Services businesses.
•Drive sales through our most efficient channels. Through our investments in product, Multi-location sales and marketing, our go-to-market mix has shifted significantly in recent years towards our most efficient sales channels — Self-serve and Multi-location. We plan to build on that progress in 2022 by continuing to explore ways to drive SMBs through our fully digital Self-serve channel, including through marketing and a more streamlined ads purchase flow, new tools to drive business owner engagement and by providing businesses with more control over their ad campaigns. We also plan to further expand our Multi-location product offerings and attribution solutions as well as leverage our strengthened customer relationships to both acquire new multi-location customers and expand our business with existing customers. 
•Deliver more value to advertisers. Our performance in recent years has demonstrated that by delivering greater value to advertisers in the form of more ad clicks and tailored product offerings, we can improve customer satisfaction with our products and increase our NTC retention rate. We believe that we can achieve further retention gains through this approach. In 2022, we plan to continue improving the relevance of our ads by introducing new ad formats as well as by driving efficiency through ad system optimizations and improved matching.
•Enhance the consumer experience. Our trusted content fuels our consumer flywheel, bringing more users and businesses to Yelp. In 2022, we plan to invest in a broad set of consumer product and marketing initiatives designed to drive consumer engagement and content contributions. For example, we are working to reduce review contribution friction, convert more users into contributors, and improve the distribution of reviews across categories and geographies, which we believe will increase the percentage of reviewed businesses and thereby attract more consumers and further benefit businesses in turn. We are also investing in product initiatives to further differentiate the experience between categories and increase engagement, as well as bring the consumer experience on our Android app to parity with our iOS app.
Margin Improvement
•Our revenue growth strategies also drive improved profitability. Retention improvements also benefit our margins and, accordingly, we believe our investments designed to improve lead quality and deliver more value to advertisers will also drive margin expansion. We expect that our plans to drive sales through our Self-serve and Multi-location sales channels will also help improve our margins; in addition to being more margin-accretive than Local sales, these channels have historically exhibited better revenue retention characteristics than Local sales. As a result, we expect our Self-serve and Multi-location sales initiatives will continue to help improve our overall revenue retention as revenue from these channels makes up an increasing percentage of our total advertising revenue.
•Reduce expenses through distributed work. We believe that operating on a distributed basis is in the best interests of both Yelp and our employees; it reduces our reliance on the San Francisco Bay Area and provides employees with more flexibility. As we hire into geographies outside of the Bay Area, we believe that we can improve employee retention and a more diverse workforce. We also expect that this will result in our stock-based compensation as a 
percentage of revenue to trend toward a less dilutive mix over time. In addition, we continue to explore additional opportunities to reduce our real estate footprint.
Our Products and Services
Advertising
We provide a range of free and paid advertising products to businesses of all sizes, including through the products listed below, which provide the ability to deliver targeted search advertising to large local audiences. As in past years, advertising accounted for the vast majority of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021, contributing 96% of our revenue, which was fairly consistent with the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. We recognize revenue from our business listing and advertising products, including advertising sold by partners, as advertising revenue.

Advertising Products 
CPC Search Advertising | We allow businesses to promote themselves as a sponsored search result on our platform, on the Yelp pages of businesses in the same or related categories, and other places on our platform, as well as through the ability to provide competing quotes for consumers using our Request-A-Quote feature. We primarily sell performance-based ads, which our advertising platform matches to individual consumers through auctions priced on a CPC basis. We generate a majority of our advertising revenue from the sale of CPC advertising. 
Multi-location Ad Products | We offer a range of ad products designed for multi-location advertisers, including: Showcase Ads, which showcase special offerings with limited-time localized promotions in relevant search results; Spotlight Ads, which highlight special offers and promotions related to holidays or other special events in a carousel directly on the Yelp app home screen; and Yelp Audiences, which extends campaign reach to our high-intent audience both on and off platform. We also offer a first-party attribution solution, Yelp Store Visits.
Business Page Products 
Free Online Business Account | Businesses have the ability to create a free online business account and claim the Yelp page for each of their business locations. Once a business has claimed its listing page, it can update its listing information and has the option to purchase premium listing page features. 
Upgrade Package | Our most popular product after search ads is our Upgrade Package, which includes our Enhanced Profile, Business Highlights, Yelp Portfolio and Yelp Connect products, each as described below, among other features. 
Branded Profile | Our Branded Profile product provides businesses with access to premium features in connection with their Yelp pages, such as the ability to update listing information and select photos or videos to highlight on the page through a slideshow feature. 
Enhanced Profile | In addition to providing businesses with the same premium features and support options as our Branded Profile product, our Enhanced Profile product prevents ads from other businesses from appearing on the Yelp pages of our Enhanced Profile customers. 
Yelp Verified License | Yelp Verified License is a badge that appears on Yelp business pages as a paid upgrade for certain licensed advertisers, primarily in our home & local services category. The badge indicates that we have verified the business's trade license and confirmed it was in good standing as of a certain date, allowing businesses to distinguish themselves as licensed and helping consumers make safe and confident decisions when selecting businesses for their projects. 
Business Highlights | Businesses in eligible categories can pay to highlight up to six attributes that make their business unique, such as "Family Owned" or "Pet Friendly." 
Yelp Portfolio | Our Yelp Portfolio product allows businesses to showcase their specialties to prospective customers through a photo collection of projects. 


Yelp Connect | Yelp Connect provides advertisers with a channel to market new offerings, such as new menu items, or communicate business updates to customers. Yelp automatically promotes Yelp Connect posts to a business's followers.
Yelp Logo | Yelp Logo provides businesses with the ability to display their logos in high-visibility locations, including prominently at the top of Yelp business pages and in search results. 

Transactions
In addition to our advertising products, we also offer features and consumer-interactive tools to facilitate transactions between consumers and the local businesses they find on Yelp. These features are primarily available through partner integrations, the largest of which — by both transaction volume and revenue — is our partnership with Grubhub, which allows consumers to place food orders for pickup and delivery through Yelp. We recognize revenue from these sources on a net basis as transactions revenue.
Other
We generate other revenue through subscription services, licensing payments for access to Yelp data and other non-advertising, non-transaction arrangements. 

Yelp Reservations | We provide restaurants, nightlife and certain other venues with the ability to offer online reservations directly from their Yelp business pages through our Yelp Reservations product, which also includes front-of-house management tools. 
Yelp Guest Manager | Previously referred to as Yelp Waitlist, Yelp Guest Manager is a subscription-based waitlist management solution that allows consumers to check wait times and join waitlists remotely and businesses to efficiently manage seating and server rotation. Yelp Guest Manager helps simplify restaurants’ front-of-house operations and is available to consumers directly on business pages as well as in-store kiosks. 
Yelp Knowledge | Through partnerships with companies such as Sprinklr and Chatmeter, our Yelp Knowledge program offers business owners local analytics and insights through access to our historical data and other proprietary content. Our Yelp Knowledge partners pay us license fees for access to Yelp Knowledge content. 
Yelp Fusion | Our Yelp Fusion program enables developers to build products that include our high-quality content and data. We partner with industry leaders like Apple, which makes our content available through Apple Maps and its virtual assistant Siri, as well as several auto manufacturers, including Mercedes-Benz, to make our content available in their in-dash experiences. We offer free access to certain basic information through our publicly available APIs as well as paid access to broader sets of content and data for consumer-facing enterprise use. We typically enter into multi-year license agreements with paying Yelp Fusion customers, with rates determined based on the type and volume of usage.
Other Partnerships | Other non-advertising partner arrangements include content licensing and allowing third-party data providers to update and manage business listing information on behalf of businesses. 

Sales
We sell our advertising products directly through our sales force, indirectly through partners and online through our website. 
Self-serve Ads. Our Self-serve sales channel allows businesses to purchase and manage their Yelp ads directly from our website or Yelp for Business Owners app. Businesses can purchase sponsored CPC search advertising, Yelp Connect and business page upgrades such as Business Highlights and Yelp Portfolios directly through this channel. The convenience of our Self-serve sales channel has helped us improve revenue retention and reduce our reliance on sales and customer support headcount, and continues to be a strategic priority for us. In 2021, we improved the claim and ads purchase flow as well as our business owner platform to better guide new customers through key actions to help them be successful on Yelp. We plan to invest further in driving business owner engagement and providing businesses with more control over their ad campaigns in 2022 to drive SMB customer acquisition through this channel.
Direct Local Sales. Our Local sales team primarily sells CPC advertising to SMBs. Local sales representatives are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads by identifying and contacting businesses through direct engagement, direct marketing campaigns and weekly e-mails to claimed local businesses. Although our Local sales team is primarily focused on increasing revenue by adding new customers, sales representatives on our client partner team engage with existing customers with the goal of increasing their overall spend. 
Revenue from direct Local sales has historically comprised the largest share of advertising revenue and was driven by growth in Local sales headcount. As we have increased our focus on our more margin-accretive Self-serve and Multi-location channels in recent years, however, we have become less reliant on Local sales headcount to drive growth. We have been able to substantially reduce the size of the Local sales team accordingly, while also retaining our most tenured and successful sales representatives and optimizing their compensation structure. Although Local sales revenue was still the largest share of advertising revenue in 2021, its share has decreased in recent years as Self-serve and Multi-location sales revenue has increased.
Multi-location Sales. Our Multi-location sales team is responsible for selling our advertising products to national, mid-market and franchise businesses. We believe that Multi-location advertising budgets represent a significant growth opportunity and this channel has been a focus of our strategic investments throughout the pandemic as we expanded our products and attribution capabilities to meet the needs of these advertisers. We believe that our enhanced suite of Multi-location products, together with strengthened customer relationships, provide a significant opportunity to expand revenue from this sales channel. We plan to continue investing in initiatives to grow revenue from our Multi-location sales channel in 2022.
Sales Partnerships. We also generate revenue through the resale of our advertising products by certain agencies and partners, such as Thryv, as well as monetization of remnant advertising inventory through third-party ad networks. Our Yelp Ads Certified Partners Program allows partner agencies to independently sell and manage ad campaigns on behalf of their SMB clients, providing increased centralization and flexibility. The products covered by these arrangements include all of our profile products as well as search advertising. 
Customer Success. Our customer success team supports existing business advertisers through account management, cross-selling and retention initiatives. 
Technology
We rely on a set of core technologies that enable us to be a trusted local resource for consumers and a partner in success to businesses of all sizes. We provide scalable services across platforms and devices using a combination of proprietary, open source and third-party technology solutions and products:
•Anticipating Consumer Needs. We analyze the large volumes of data collected from our platform and apply our proprietary indexing and ranking techniques to provide our users with contextual, relevant and up-to-date information. Our sophisticated search platform is 30% to 50% faster than the industry-standard solution while costing as much as 40% less to run for some use cases, allowing better search matching and ad targeting. We also apply machine learning algorithms to predict user needs and preferences based on factors such as the user's recent activity, location, time of day and season, then tailor the user's experience on Yelp accordingly. In our Services categories, for example, if a user recently searched for movers, we might suggest searches for businesses offering self-storage or junk removal. Similarly, if our data suggests that a user is a homeowner, we might promote collections of businesses that offer spring cleaning or other seasonally appropriate services.
•Recommendation Software. Our recommendation software refers to the proprietary automated trust and safety software systems that we have developed to analyze the relevance, reliability and utility of each review submitted to our platform. “Recommended” reviews — those that the software deems to be the most useful and reliable — appear directly on Yelp business pages, while less trustworthy and unreliable content appear on secondary pages and do not factor into a business’s overall star rating. Our recommendation software applies the same objective standards to each review, regardless of whether the business being reviewed advertises on Yelp, based on hundreds of signals associated with the business, review and reviewer. These signals include the reviewer’s type and level of activity with Yelp (which might correspond to the reviewer’s reliability or suggest reviewer biases) and whether certain reviews originate from related Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses (which might mean the reviews were submitted by the same person). The software evaluates each review based on hundreds of signals every day and, as a result, its analysis can change over time as new data becomes available; reviews that were previously recommended may become not recommended, and reviews that were previously not recommended may be restored to recommended status.
•Mobile Solutions. With our most engaged users on our mobile app, we have invested significant resources into developing a comprehensive mobile platform for consumers. Although our platform supports both major smartphone operating systems available today, iOS and Android, our iOS app has a more modern and personalized user experience and iOS app users drove the majority of ad clicks from any source in 2021. In 2022, we plan to invest in opportunities to increase engagement with Android users by, among other things, bringing the Android user experience in line with the iOS experience. 
Similarly, we designed our Yelp for Business Owners app to make it easier for businesses to engage with their customers and manage their presence on Yelp. Currently available for iOS and Android, this app provides businesses with daily metrics reports, page view analytics and leads data, as well as the ability to manage quote requests and opportunities in Nearby Jobs. Businesses can also purchase, customize and manage Yelp ads through the Yelp for Business Owners app.
•Ad Delivery. We use proprietary ad targeting and delivery technologies that are designed to quickly target and display hyper-relevant advertisements to users of our platform. When a consumer enters a search on our app, these technologies determine the most relevant ads to show and serve those ads alongside the organic search results, typically in less than half a second. Our targeting software leverages machine learning models that evaluate more than 350 signals about the user, business and search context to make sure consumers see the right ad at the right time and drive ad clicks.
•Auction System. We use an auction system to determine the price we charge advertisers for ad clicks. Our auction system uses advanced algorithms to bid on ad placements on behalf of advertisers, taking into account their budgets, current and predicted levels of relevant consumer traffic, changes in user behavior and competition from other advertisers, among other things. These bidding algorithms are also designed to prioritize spending advertiser budgets efficiently and maximize ad clicks, with the goal of delivering as much value to advertisers as possible. For example, if our models predict that relevant consumer traffic will meaningfully decrease for a period of time during an ad campaign, our bidding algorithms will dynamically allocate advertiser budget around that period to avoid spending a disproportionate amount of the budget while supply is constrained. To conduct an average of 20 million auctions per day, we predict demand for 16 million ad categories and distinct time intervals to set bid pricing and pacing, then optimize bids 48 times per day per advertiser.
•Infrastructure. The vast majority of our platform is currently hosted by Amazon Web Services from multiple locations, which allows us to scale our infrastructure dynamically according to demand as well as optimize the cost and performance of our infrastructure. Our platform is designed to have high availability, from the Internet connectivity providers we choose, to the servers, databases and networking hardware that we deploy. We design our systems such that the failure of any individual component is not expected to affect the overall availability of our platform. We also leverage other third-party cloud-based services such as content delivery networks, rich-content storage, map-related services, ad serving and bulk processing.
•Network Security. Computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service and other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of computer systems have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past and we expect them to occur periodically on our systems in the future. For this reason, our platform includes a host of encryption, antivirus, multi-factor authentication, firewall and patch-management technologies designed to help protect and maintain the systems and computers across our business. We regularly conduct security audits and penetration tests of our applications and network infrastructure, as well as run a bug reporting program that offers financial incentives to encourage security researchers to identify and report vulnerabilities.
Maintaining the Integrity of Our Content
Providing access to useful and reliable information to help inform consumers’ spending decisions is critical to our mission of connecting people with great local businesses. With misinformation and deceptive behavior common across the internet, we have prioritized combating this sort of conduct since our earliest days to maintain user trust and level the playing field for hard-working businesses that earn their great reputations honestly. Our industry-leading trust and safety measures include investments in both technology and human moderation:
Recommendation Software. Our automated recommendation software is our first line of defense against unreliable content and misinformation submitted to our platform. As described in more detail under "—Technology" above, our recommendation software analyzes billions of data points and hundreds of signals from all reviews, businesses and reviewers in an effort to recommend the most useful and reliable reviews. Our recommendation software helps us mitigate misinformation at scale by detecting and de-emphasizing less trustworthy reviews, including content that may be:
•Biased: including reviews written by those with ties to a business, such as competitors, disgruntled employees, friends or family.
•Solicited: when someone associated with a business requested the review, which can create a positive bias that is unfair to other businesses. When asked to write a review by a business, customers may feel pressured to give the business a higher star rating than someone who was inspired to write a review on their own. Businesses also tend to ask for reviews from customers they know will give them a great rating.
•Less reliable: including reviews written by less active users, whom we don't know enough about to recommend their opinion to our community, and reviews connected to suspicious behavior, such as when a disproportionate number of reviews for a business are submitted from the same IP address.
•Less useful: including unhelpful rants and raves, as well as activity driven by a recent media story.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 71% of the reviews submitted to our platform were recommended by our automated software and approximately 21% were not recommended but still accessible on secondary pages. Although they do not factor into a business’s overall star rating, we provide access to reviews that are not recommended because they provide additional perspectives and information on reviewed businesses and reviewers, as well as transparency as to the efficacy of our recommendation software.
Community. Yelp has always been a community-driven review platform, and we encourage authentic content from the start of the user experience. We encourage users to complete a public profile, which not only helps build a community but also helps signal the reliability of their content. We also established the Yelp Elite Squad to provide recognition to users who are active in the Yelp community and consistently contribute high-quality content. We also work to educate our local business communities on our stance against review solicitation, why it harms consumers and how it can undermine a business’s reputation. We believe that by engaging with businesses and sharing our commitment to maintaining a level playing field, we can reduce the frequency with which businesses engage in such activities. 
In addition to encouraging reliable content and fair play from the outset, our communities serve as additional layers of oversight. For example, we provide easy ways for our communities of users and business owners to report content that they believe violates our guidelines and suggest updates to business information. We also provide multiple ways for business owners to respond to reviews.
Human Content Moderation. In addition to investigating individual reports of content that violates our policies, our User Operations team conducts and facilitates larger investigations into attempts to deceive consumers. For example, we proactively work to identify businesses and individuals who offer or receive cash, discounts or other benefits in exchange for reviews, such as review solicitation and reputation management companies that offer to artificially inflate search rankings and online reputations. Our human-powered moderation is also able to identify and thwart more nuanced attempts to mislead consumers that platforms with less sophisticated and fully automated content moderation may miss. In 2018, for example, after learning that some crisis and faith-based pregnancy centers were misleading people seeking abortion care, our User Operations team manually investigated more than 2,000 business listings to verify that our platform was accurately representing the services that these clinics offered.
In addition to taking direct corrective action — such as recategorizing businesses to appropriately reflect their services, as in the example above — if we identify or confirm any such issues through our investigations, we typically pursue one or more of the courses of action described below (each of which we may also employ on a stand-alone basis).
Consumer Alerts Program. Our consumer alerts program warns consumers when we find evidence of extreme attempts to manipulate a business’s ratings and reviews or other egregious conduct that may harm consumers and unfairly put other businesses at a disadvantage. When we issue a consumer alert, a warning message appears above the review section of the business’s Yelp page with information about the reason for the alert and, where available, a link to the evidence we collected in support of the alert. We issue consumer alerts for the following types of activity:
•Unusual activity: in order for Yelp to remain a useful resource, reviews must be based on genuine, first-hand experiences. When people take to a business’s Yelp page to express their views after the business receives increased public attention, our User Operations team may temporarily disable the posting of content to the page and publish an alert as they investigate and remove content that violates our policies. In 2020, we expanded this category of alert to add new notifications informing consumers when a business gains public attention for either being accused of, or the target 
of, racist behavior. Additionally, throughout 2021, we placed alerts on businesses that chose to ignore mask mandates or that were on the receiving end of backlash when they implemented vaccine requirements for customers. 
•Suspicious review activity: this alert informs consumers if we have uncovered a disproportionate number of positive reviews submitted from the same IP address, which can indicate a concerted effort to inflate the business’s overall star rating on Yelp. We also issue this type of alert when we discover a business has a possible connection to a deceptive review ring.
•Compensated activity: we issue this type of consumer alert if we encounter a business attempting to purchase favorable reviews, incentivizing new or updated reviews, or offering compensation to remove reviews.
•Questionable legal threats: when we receive evidence that a business is making dubious legal threats against a reviewer or using a contractual gag clause in an attempt to prevent critical reviews, we issue this type of alert to warn others that the business may be attempting to abuse the legal system to maintain an inflated star rating.
Removal of Reviews. We regularly remove reviews from our platform that we believe violate our terms of service, including, without limitation: reviews that do not reflect a firsthand consumer experience; content that has been bought, sold or traded; and reviews that are posted by someone we believe to be affiliated with the reviewed business. We also take steps to ensure that Yelp is a safe and welcoming place for everyone by removing threatening, harassing or lewd content, as well as hate speech and other displays of bigotry. Consumers can access information about reviews that we have removed for a particular business by clicking on a link on the business’s Yelp page. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 8% of the reviews submitted to our platform had been removed.
Coordination with Law Enforcement. We regularly cooperate with law enforcement and consumer protection agencies to investigate and identify businesses and individuals who may be engaged in false advertising or other deceptive practices relating to reviews. 
Legal Action. Our terms of service prohibit the buying and selling of reviews, as well as writing fake reviews. We regularly issue demands to third parties engaging in these and other deceptive activities that they cease such activities in relation to our platform. In egregious cases, we take legal action against businesses we believe to be engaged in deceptive practices based on these prohibitions.
Consumer Engagement
At the heart of our business are the vibrant communities of users that contribute the content on our platform. We help businesses succeed by empowering them to reach a large audience of purchase-oriented consumers, which depends on our ability to attract consumer traffic with valuable content. The rich, firsthand information about local businesses that our contributors share — in the form of reviews, ratings, photos and more — is the reason consumers come to Yelp when making their spending decisions and is therefore the foundation of our value proposition to businesses. Although measures of our content (including our cumulative review metric) and traffic (including our desktop and mobile unique visitors and app unique device metrics) do not factor directly into the advertising arrangements we have with our advertising customers, this dynamic underpins our ability to deliver ad clicks and drive conversion of advertisers' services. Increases in these metrics improve our value proposition to local businesses as they seek easy-to-use and effective advertising solutions.
Community Management
For the above reasons, we foster and support communities of contributors and make the consumer experience a top priority. We have a team of Community Managers and Community Ambassadors based across the United States and Canada whose primary goals are to support and grow communities of contributors in the local markets that they serve, raise brand awareness and engage with their surrounding communities through:
•planning and executing fun and engaging events for the community, such as parties, outings and activities at restaurants, museums, hotels and other local places of interest;
•getting to know community members and helping them get to know one another to foster an offline community experience that can be transferred online;
•promoting Yelp, including guest appearances on local television and radio, and at local events such as concerts and street fairs; and
•recurring weekly e-mail newsletters to share information with the community about local businesses, events and activities.
Through these activities, we believe our Community Management team helps us increase awareness of our platform and grow avid communities who are willing to contribute content to our platform. Even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Community Management team have continued these efforts by hosting virtual events and helping consumers and local businesses stay connected during these extraordinary times. We plan to continue these community development efforts in 2022. 
Yelp Elite Squad
Our Community Managers' responsibilities include engaging with our most important contributors — Yelp Elite Squad members. From the earliest days of Yelp, it was clear that some of our contributors went above and beyond with their prolific reviews, thoughtful photos and commitment to supporting local businesses by sharing their experiences. These users were not only active in their Yelp communities, but were also role models on and offline. Their voices helped make Yelp what it is today, and we started the Yelp Elite Squad to recognize these passionate individuals, signal our trust in them and their contributions, and encourage similar beneficial activities in our communities.
Beyond having well-written reviews, high-quality photos and a detailed personal profile, members are active evangelists for their Yelp communities. Yelp Elites receive a badge on their Yelp profile pages and Community Managers organize sponsored social events for them, which facilitates face-to-face interactions, builds the Yelp brand and fosters the sense of true community in which we believe so strongly. These behind-the-scenes looks at top-rated businesses often include interacting with business owners, hearing their unique stories and engaging with other locals in their community; however, Yelp Elites do not receive compensation for their contributions.
Intellectual Property
We rely on federal, state, and international statutory, common law and other legal rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to and distribution of our proprietary technology and algorithms, including our trade secrets, by entering into confidentiality and inventions assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, as well as confidentiality agreements with third parties and other reasonable precautions intended to prevent unauthorized disclosure.
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we pursue the registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations internationally. Our registration efforts have focused on gaining protection of our trademarks for the word mark “Yelp” and the Yelp burst logo, among others. These marks are material to our business and essential to our brand identity as they enable others to easily identify us as the source of the services offered in connection with these marks. We currently have limited patent protection for our core business, which may make it more difficult to assert certain of our intellectual property rights. For example, the contractual restrictions, policies and processes that protect our trade secrets, including our proprietary technology and algorithms, provide only limited safeguards against misappropriation.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property rights is also costly and time consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. 
Companies in the Internet, technology and media industries own large numbers of patents and other intellectual property rights, and may request license agreements or threaten to enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of such rights. From time to time, we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights. We are also currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we may face more claims of infringement.
Competition
We compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets, and we expect competition to intensify further in the future with the emergence of new technologies and market entrants. Our competitors consist of companies that help businesses — particularly businesses in our strategically important Services categories and, to a lesser extent, restaurants category — connect and engage with consumers, including:
•online search engines and directories, such as Google, as well as traditional, offline business guides and directories;
•online and offline providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals, such as TripAdvisor;
•providers of online marketing and tools for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns, such as Google, Facebook and Twitter, as well as various forms of traditional offline advertising, including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages and newspapers;
•restaurant reservation and seating tools, such as OpenTable, as well as food ordering and delivery services; and
•home and/or local services-related platforms and offerings, such as Angi.
Our competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, substantially greater market share, established marketing relationships with, and access to, large existing user bases and substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. These companies may use these advantages to offer products similar to ours at a lower price, develop different products to compete with our current solutions and respond more quickly and effectively than we do to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements. Certain competitors could also use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in markets in which we operate.
We believe our ability to compete successfully for users, content, and advertising and other customers depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:
•the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of our products and services compared to those of our competitors;
•our ability, in and of itself as well as in comparison to the ability of our competitors, to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services;
•the quantity, quality and reliability of our content, including its breadth, depth and timeliness;
•our ad targeting and measurement capabilities, and those of our competitors;
•the size, composition and level of engagement of our consumer audience relative to those of our competitors;
•our marketing and selling efforts, and those of our competitors;
•the pricing of our products and services relative to those of our competitors;
•the actual or perceived return our customers receive from our products and services relative to returns from our competitors;
•the frequency and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;
•acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors; and
•our reputation and brand strength relative to our competitors.
Government Regulation
As a company conducting business on the internet, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including laws regarding privacy, data protection, data security, user-generated content and consumer protection, among others. For example:
•Privacy, Data Protection and Data Security. Because we receive, store and process personal information and other user data, including credit card information in certain cases, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign privacy, data protection and data security laws and regulations restricting the collection, storing, use, retention, processing and disclosure of personal information and other user data. The laws in many jurisdictions require companies to implement specific security controls and contractual arrangements to protect certain types of information. Likewise, many 
jurisdictions have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their information. For example, in the United States, many states require companies to implement reasonable security measures and all states and U.S. territories require businesses to notify affected individuals and government entities of the occurrence of security breaches affecting certain personal information.
•Liability for Third-Party Action. We rely on laws limiting the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties, such as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act ("CDA 230") in the United States.
•Advertising. We are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and guidelines that regulate the way we distinguish paid search results and other types of advertising from unpaid search results.
We operate in a rapidly evolving industry, and many laws and regulations that impact our business are being proposed, still evolving or being tested in courts. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, and they could be interpreted and applied in ways that harm our business. They may also conflict with other rules, be interpreted and applied inconsistently (including from country to country) and in ways that are at odds with our current policies and practices. As our business grows and evolves, we will also become subject to additional laws and regulations, including in jurisdictions outside of the United States.
For example, laws providing immunity to websites that publish user-generated content are regularly tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content provided by users. There are also regular Congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under CDA 230, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change as a result. Claims and legislation applicable to user-generated content also regularly arise in other jurisdictions.
Regulatory frameworks for privacy issues in particular are also currently in flux worldwide, and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. In the United States, states have begun to introduce stringent and comprehensive privacy, data protection and data security legislation, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which took effect in 2020. The CCPA and its implementing regulations give California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA will be expanded substantially on January 1, 2023, when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) becomes fully operative. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal information, further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising, establish restrictions on the retention of personal information, expand the types of data breaches subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, provide for increased penalties for CPRA violations concerning California residents under the age of 16, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. If additional individual states pass privacy, data protection and data security laws that place different obligations or limitations on the processing of personal information of individuals in those states, it will become more complex to comply with these laws and our compliance costs and potential liability may increase. There is also discussion in Congress of new comprehensive federal data protection and privacy law to which we likely would be subject if it is enacted.
Foreign laws and regulations concerning privacy, data protection and data security are also evolving and are often more restrictive and burdensome than those in the United States; any failure on our part to comply with them may subject us to significant liabilities. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which took effect in 2018, imposes comprehensive privacy, data protection and data security obligations on businesses and imposes significant penalties for non-compliance. Among other obligations under the GDPR, businesses are required to make contractual privacy, data protection and data security commitments; give detailed disclosures about how they collect, use and share personal information; maintain adequate security measures; notify regulators and affected individuals of certain personal information breaches; meet extensive governance and documentation requirements; and honor individuals’ rights to their personal information. 
European data protection laws including the GDPR also restrict the transfer of personal information from Europe to the United States and most other countries unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal information. However, recent judicial and administrative decisions have called into question the viability of one of the primary safeguards allowing such transfers, and there are currently few, if any, viable alternative safeguards. If we are unable to implement a valid solution for personal information transfers from Europe, we will face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing or transferring personal information from Europe and may be required to increase our data processing capabilities in Europe at significant expense.
Other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency as well, which could increase the cost and complexity of operating our business.
For additional information, see the section titled "Risk Factors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and other matters. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such regulations and obligations could harm our business."
Human Capital Management
At Yelp, we deeply value our community of employees who sustain our culture through their dedication to our mission of connecting people with great local businesses and to living our values of authenticity, tenacity, creativity, collegiality, and prioritizing consumer trust. We are committed to providing them with a great work experience by creating an equitable and inclusive environment. We have long focused on building a diverse team of innovators and problem solvers who can bring their most authentic selves to work, which we believe positions our employees to relate to and solve the diverse needs of consumers and businesses. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 4,400 employees globally across the following teams:
Distributed Work
With the health and well-being of our employees, extended workforce and communities in mind, we promptly migrated our workforce to work from home in March 2020 as the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic started to become clear. While the rapid transition presented challenges, over the course of 2020 it became evident that we were able to operate successfully as a distributed remote workforce and that distributed operations were beneficial to both Yelp and our employees. For example, in addition to allowing us to reduce our office space and our reliance on the San Francisco Bay Area, distributed work provides employees with greater opportunities for flexible work schedules and reduces time spent commuting.
The success of this shift in 2020 demonstrated the feasibility of a distributed workforce at Yelp for the longer term, and in 2021 we announced that we would continue our distributed operations on a permanent basis. While we plan to maintain offices in the locations where we had a presence prior to the pandemic, a significant portion of our team works remotely on a full-time basis or comes into the office only a few days each week. We believe this model provides even greater flexibility to our employees, who now have the opportunity to relocate within the countries where we operate so they can live where they want to live and work where they will feel most effective, and will result in improved employee retention. It also allows us to access and attract great talent from a more diverse pool of candidates across the United States, Canada and Europe.
Culture
We consider our company culture to be one of our competitive strengths; it is at the foundation of our success and continues to help drive our business forward as a pivotal part of our everyday operations. It allows us to attract and retain a talented group of employees, create an energetic work experience and continue to innovate in a highly competitive market. 
Distributed Workforce. While we have always taken great pride in our company culture, it has never been static, and our decision to remain a distributed workforce is driving its latest evolution. We are working to build on our existing strong and collaborative culture with the goal of supporting and fostering a thriving distributed workforce. These efforts include focusing on equity in opportunities for career advancement, regardless of whether an employee is remote or spending a few days each week in an office, as well as in opportunities to contribute by continuing to hold meetings in digital space. At the same time, we are also working to reestablish our pre-pandemic in-person office environments that invited collaboration and creativity, now with increased flexibility.
Employee Engagement. To ensure that we are maintaining our vibrant culture and addressing any areas of employee concern, we conduct an annual employee engagement survey to inform our plans, policies and programs. This survey covers a wide range of topics including: compensation and benefits; management; work-life balance; feedback and recognition; Company confidence; inclusion; and learning and development. In 2021, we also conducted a manager effectiveness survey, a benefits survey to assess whether our benefits programs were meeting employee needs, and a remote work survey on issues such as managing remotely, employee well-being in a remote environment, how teams are adjusting to remote work, and remote growth and connection opportunities. We implemented a number of initiatives in response to the results of our 2021 surveys, including efforts to further facilitate flexible employee schedules, increasing the remote work stipend for new hires to set up their home offices, and further expanding our wellness offerings to include a caregiver reimbursement, fertility benefits and additional paid wellness days, among other things.
Fostering Local Communities. Our culture extends beyond our offices and into the local communities in which people use Yelp. Our Community Management team’s responsibilities include fostering and supporting communities of users in the local markets that they serve, as well as encouraging consumers to share their experiences with local businesses. Community Managers organize events throughout the year to engage our most important contributors, which facilitates face-to-face interactions, builds the Yelp brand and fosters the sense of true community in which we believe so strongly. We also engage with small businesses, including through conferences and events hosted by industry groups to interact with and get feedback from our core community of local business owners. Even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued these efforts by hosting virtual events and offering tools to help consumers and local businesses stay connected during these extraordinary times. 
Content Moderation. Consumer trust is a top priority at Yelp, and we take significant measures to maintain the integrity and quality of the content on our platform while leveling the playing field for hard-working business owners who rightfully earn their great reputations. We place a high value on personal expression and provide a platform that encourages people to share their experiences. At the same time, we take active steps to enhance the trust and safety of our users, as well as to provide them with reliable content to inform their spending decisions. Our User Operations team is on the front lines of our consumer protection efforts; it works to maintain the high quality of content on our platform, including by evaluating reviews, photos and other information about businesses. User Operations also manages our consumer alerts program, which includes warnings about businesses that have been accused of, or are the target of, racist incidents to help inform users' spending decisions and whether they will feel welcome. In addition to these content moderation efforts, our User Operations team communicates with the contributors and businesses impacted by our moderation decisions to promote constructive participation on Yelp.
Making a Difference. We endeavor to have a positive impact on the diverse communities in which people use Yelp by using our platform to raise awareness, promote economic opportunity for those in need and support organizations that serve local communities. Our initiatives in 2021 included: programs to support Asian- and LGBTQ-owned businesses as well as underserved business communities; partnerships aimed at promoting diverse businesses and encouraging businesses owners to make their businesses a safe and welcoming place for everyone; and hosting our inaugural Women in Business and Black in Business Summits to celebrate diverse business owners and provide a forum for them to share their stories and offer tactical advice for entrepreneurs.
The Yelp Foundation. The Yelp Foundation (the “Foundation”), a non-profit organization established by our board of directors in 2011, directly supports consumers and local businesses in the communities in which we operate. In 2011, our board of directors approved the contribution and issuance to the Foundation of 520,000 shares of our common stock to fund the Foundation’s grants to local non-profit organizations that are actively engaged in supporting community and small business growth. The Foundation held 215,500 shares as of December 31, 2021, which represented less than 1% of our outstanding common stock.
One of the Foundation’s missions is to promote a culture of philanthropy among Yelp employees. In 2021, we built on the Foundation’s employee-matching program to double match Yelp employee donations made around issues that matter most to our employees. For example, the Foundation doubled matched donations to organizations fighting to stop Asian hate and 
prevent gun violence from March through May, as well as donations to organizations advocating for gender equality and providing reproductive health services and financial support to underserved women in October. 
Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging
Every local business has a unique story; having a diverse workforce means our employees are better equipped to relate to and solve for the diverse needs of consumers and businesses. As a result, we are committed to increasing diversity at all levels of our organization to reflect the diversity of the communities in which we live and work. Our Executive Diversity Task Force, which includes our chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, oversees the implementation of our diversity initiatives, including by holding individual department heads accountable for growing the diversity of their organizations. 
Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we learned new ways of working and our understanding of the potential approaches to maintaining an engaged and productive workforce evolved. While transitioning to a distributed workforce was initially reactive, we are now focused on proactively growing and cultivating an employee community based on a variety of backgrounds, talents and perspectives, including by evaluating new opportunities to improve access and equity. For example, our ability to attract talent was previously limited by our requirement that employees work in our physical office space; we now have the opportunity to access talent in areas where we do not currently have offices. This has allowed us to reach a wider pool of individuals from a broader variety of backgrounds, which we believe will allow us to create an even more diverse organization and address other inequalities, such as the urban-rural employment gap.
While our 2021 Diversity Report* showed that we have more work to do, it also showed that our efforts have had a positive impact.
*    Our 2021 Diversity Report and the diversity data presented above are based on self-reported information from our employees between September 8, 2020 and August 31, 2021, reflect judgments about our organizational structure and, with respect to the ethnic diversity data presented above, do not include employees who declined to provide the relevant information. The Native American grouping includes Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders per U.S. EEO-1 reporting requirements. Management includes all people managers.
We also firmly believe that inclusion is just as important as diversity. We aim to cultivate a sense of belonging through company-supported employee resource and affinity groups, hosting events that provide our employees with the opportunity to celebrate and learn about the diverse cultures of their colleagues, and instituting a mandatory company-wide diversity training program that covers systemic racism and institutional bias. For example, our Yelp Employee Resource Groups (“YERGs”) serve as a resource for employees with shared social identities, characteristics or life experiences and help foster employee engagement, professional development and a sense of belonging. We now have 20 YERGs that count nearly half of our employee population as members and provide key insights and support for employees.
Talent Attraction and Retention
Our future depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand and we expect to continue to face significant competition from other companies in hiring and retaining such personnel. While our plans to continue operating on a distributed basis may mitigate this challenge by expanding the pool of candidates from which we draw, we may continue to face significant competition for product and engineering employees in the San Francisco Bay Area in particular, where our headquarters is located and where the cost of living is high.
We focus on attracting top talent through our employment marketing and outreach initiatives. We advertise our career opportunities on premier job boards and aggregators in addition to running targeted brand campaigns that enable us to connect with diverse talent pools. We maintain an active voice on social media through our Life at Yelp channel, which highlights employee testimonials regarding their Yelp experiences. Our distributed workforce model has expanded our hiring reach, 
allowing us to access and attract great talent pools regardless of geography. We also focus on attracting early-in-career talent through university outreach and on-campus recruiting efforts, including at historically Black colleges and universities.
We believe that happy employees are successful employees and that providing an environment in which our employees can thrive both personally and professionally will help us attract and retain great talent. In addition to offering our employees the flexibility to work remotely, we offer competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits, including standard health, dental, vision, life and disability insurance benefits as well as a 401(k) plan with company matching. To foster a sense of ownership and align the interests of our employees and stockholders, we also grant equity awards, primarily in the form of restricted stock units, to eligible employees under our equity incentive plans. In addition, the Foundation offers up to $1,000 in matching donations each year to charitable organizations made by our regular full-time employees. 
We also provide comprehensive talent development programs, as described below, as well as health and financial wellness programs. In addition to our insurance benefits, our wellness program includes a monthly wellness subsidy, access to mental health support and services through Talkspace and our Employee Assistance Program, as well as financial wellness programs such as financial counseling and tools to help manage student loans.
COVID-19 Response
Our focus on the health and well-being of our employees is also reflected in our continuing response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been driven by guidance from applicable governmental and public health authorities. In addition to continuing our distributed operations, we continue to provide additional time off to employees for health and wellness, offer various stipends for home office equipment and to assist with caregiver expenses, and communicate regularly with employees regarding the impacts of the pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures. We also hosted virtual trainings and events to help employees adapt to working and managing remotely, as well as maintaining their mental well-being while working and parenting from home. We are continuing to monitor the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and relevant medical guidance as we evaluate office re-openings and in-person gatherings to ensure that we are putting the health and safety of our employees first.
Talent Development
To help our employees succeed in their current roles and to aid their career development, we emphasize continuous learning and development opportunities. Our talent development programs begin with a global onboarding program to acclimate new employees to our culture and collaborative ways of working in a distributed work environment. We believe this investment in creating early connections and establishing a solid foundation for further career growth is a critical factor in employee success and ultimately employee retention. Similarly, effective leadership is an important driver of an employee’s growth and feelings of belonging and connection to our purpose. To that end, we provide leadership development programs for new and continuing managers that focus on developing the self, developing others and driving business results. 
We also provide ongoing learning opportunities for individual contributors that focus on managing the self, emotional intelligence, and career and professional development. We also recently began offering a professional development program that facilitates employees partnering with their managers to create career development plans and provides an annual development reimbursement to invest in their growth. We also offer customized coaching resources to provide individual support and develop critical skills, as well as regular, ongoing training in compliance and workplace conduct matters to all employees.
Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage and advertising spending, as well as cyclicality in economic activity:
Seasonality. Based on historical trends, our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and increases through the year to its highest level in the fourth quarter. This is also the typical spending pattern for our multi-location customers, whose ad budgets are generally lowest at the beginning of the year and peak in the fourth quarter, though SMBs tend to decrease their advertising spending at that time. Our traffic is also typically weakest in the fourth quarter of the year in connection with year-end holidays. 
Cyclicality. SMBs have historically experienced high failure rates, and we must continually add new advertisers to replace those who do not renew their advertising due to factors outside of our control, such as declining advertising budgets, closures or bankruptcies. As a result, SMBs may be disproportionately affected by negative fluctuations in the business cycle, and a 
worsening economic outlook would likely cause such businesses to decrease investments in advertising, which would adversely affect our revenue. This has been the case in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic; while restrictive measures to control the spread of COVID-19 have eased, they have had and may continue to have significant macroeconomic impacts that have been particularly challenging for SMBs. Any protracted economic downturn would have significant negative effects on our business and results of operations.
