Item 1. | BUSINESS

OUR COMPANY 
TrueBlue, Inc. (the “company,” “TrueBlue,” “we,” “us” and “our”) is a leading provider of specialized workforce solutions that help customers create growth, improve efficiency and increase reliability. We connected approximately 740,000 people with work during fiscal 2017, and served approximately 108,000 customers in a wide variety of industries through our staffing, on-site workforce management and recruitment process outsourcing services. We are headquartered in Tacoma, Washington.
We began operations in 1989, specializing in on-demand, general labor staffing services with the objective of providing customers with talent and flexible workforce solutions to enhance the performance of their businesses. We expanded our on-demand, general labor staffing services through organic geographic expansion throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Commencing in 2004, we began expanding through acquisitions to provide a full range of blue-collar staffing solutions, and to help our customers be more productive with a reliable contingent labor workforce and rapidly respond to changing business needs. Additionally, in 2014, we further expanded through acquisition to provide a full range of workforce solutions, which added on-premise contingent blue-collar staffing (we expanded this service offering with the acquisition of SIMOS in 2015), complementary outsourced service offerings in permanent employment recruitment process outsourcing (which was further strengthened by an additional acquisition in 2016), and a management service provider business, which provides customers with outsourced management of their contingent labor vendors. 
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
We report our business as three distinct reportable segments described below and in Note 16: Segment Information, to our Consolidated Financial Statements found in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
PeopleReady
PeopleReady provides access to reliable workers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico through a wide range of staffing solutions for blue-collar, contingent on-demand general and skilled labor. PeopleReady connects people to work in a broad range of industries that include construction, manufacturing and logistics, warehousing and distribution, waste and recycling, hospitality, general labor, and others. 
PeopleReady helped approximately 107,000 customers in fiscal 2017 to be more productive by providing easy access to dependable, blue-collar contingent labor. Through our PeopleReady service line, we connected approximately 352,000 people with work in fiscal 2017. We have a network of 623 branches across all 50 states, Canada and Puerto Rico.
PeopleManagement
PeopleManagement provides contingent labor and outsourced industrial workforce solutions. In comparison with PeopleReady, services are larger in scale, longer in duration, and provided on-premise at the customer’s facility.

We use the following distinct brands to market our PeopleManagement contingent workforce solutions: 

• | Staff Management | SMX specializes in exclusive outsourced recruitment and on-premise management of a facility’s contingent industrial workforce. On-premise staffing is large-scale sourcing, screening, recruiting and management of the contingent workforce at a customer’s facility in order to achieve faster hiring, lower total cost of workforce, increased safety and compliance, improved retention, greater volume flexibility, and enhanced strategic decision-making through robust reporting and analytics;


• | SIMOS Insourcing Solutions (“SIMOS”) specializes in exclusive outsourced recruitment and on-premise management of the entire warehouse operations or parts of warehouse operations in order to reduce costs and improve performance. SIMOS systematically analyzes and improves business processes in a customer’s facilities and manages the contingent workforce with incentives to drive performance improvements in cost, quality and on-time delivery. Internet sales have fundamentally changed the nature of retail supply chain. The retail market as a whole has moved significantly from conventional retail stores to growing demand for e-commerce, selling directly to its customers. These changes have driven extreme peak seasonal volumes, small number of pieces per order, intense pressure for fast delivery, and an increase of consumer product returns. We provide scalable solutions to meet the pick and pack and shipping requirements in labor intensive e-commerce warehouses. Our unique productivity model incorporates fixed price-per-unit solutions to drive client value. Additionally, our continuous analysis and improvement of processes and incentive pay drives workforce efficiency, reduces costs, lowers risk of injury and damage, and improves productivity and service levels;


• | Centerline Drivers (“Centerline”) specializes in providing dedicated and temporary truck drivers to the transportation and distribution industries. Centerline delivers compliant drivers specifically matched to each customer’s needs, allowing them to improve productivity, control costs and deliver improved service; and


• | PlaneTechs specializes in providing temporary skilled mechanics and technicians to aircraft maintenance, repair, overhaul and manufacturing companies in the commercial, government services and business aviation sectors.

PeopleManagement helped approximately 1,000 customers in 2017 to be more productive by providing easy access to dependable blue-collar contingent workforce solutions. Through our PeopleManagement service line, we connected approximately 91,000 people with work in fiscal 2017. We have over 251 locations at customers’ facilities.
PeopleScout
PeopleScout provides permanent employee recruitment process outsourcing (“RPO”) for our customers. Our RPO solution serves all major industries and job types. Our RPO solution delivers improved talent quality, faster hiring, increased scalability, reduced turnover, lower cost of recruitment, greater flexibility, and increased compliance. We leverage our proprietary candidate applicant tracking system, along with dedicated service delivery teams to work as an integrated partner with our customers in providing end-to-end talent acquisition services from sourcing candidates through onboarding employees. Our solution is highly scalable and flexible, allowing for outsourcing of all or a subset of skill categories across a series of recruitment processes and onboarding steps. Customer contracts are generally multi-year in duration and pricing is typically composed of a fee for each hire. Volume, job type, degree of recruiting difficulty, and number of recruiting process steps from sourcing to onboarding factor into pricing.
PeopleScout also includes our managed service provider (“MSP”) business which manages our customers’ contingent labor programs including vendor selection, performance management, compliance monitoring and risk management. As the customer’s exclusive MSP, we have dedicated service delivery teams which work as an integrated partner with our customer to increase the productivity of their contingent labor.
In fiscal 2017, PeopleScout connected approximately 297,000 individuals with work for approximately 200 customers. 
INDUSTRY AND MARKET DYNAMICS
The staffing industry, which includes our PeopleReady and PeopleManagement services, supplies contingent workforce solutions to minimize the cost and effort of hiring and managing permanent employees. This allows for rapid response to changes in business conditions through the ability to replace absent employees, fill new positions, and convert fixed or permanent labor costs to variable costs. Staffing companies act as intermediaries in matching available temporary workers to employer work assignments. The work assignments vary widely in duration, level of skill, and required experience. The staffing industry is large and highly fragmented with many competing companies. No single company has a dominant share of the industry. Staffing companies compete both to recruit and retain a supply of temporary workers, and to attract and retain customers who will employ these workers. Customer demand for contingent staffing services is dependent on the overall strength of the economy and workforce flexibility trends. This creates volatility for the staffing industry based on overall economic conditions. Historically, in periods of economic growth, the 
Page - 6

number of companies providing contingent workforce solutions has increased due to low barriers to entry whereas during recessionary periods, the number of companies has decreased through consolidation, bankruptcies, or other events. 
Our solutions address the following key trends contributing to anticipated staffing growth:

• | Workforce flexibility: The staffing industry continues to experience increased demand in relation to total job growth as demand for a flexible workforce continues to grow with competitive and economic pressures to reduce costs, meet dynamic seasonal demands, and respond to rapidly changing market conditions.


• | Workforce productivity: Companies are under increasing competitive pressures to improve productivity through workforce solutions that improve performance.


• | Worker preferences and access to talent: Workers are demanding more flexibility in how, when and where they work as well as access to contingent work opportunities through mobile technology. Baby boomers are leaving the workforce and leaving a talent shortage in what have traditionally been blue-collar trades. The remaining workers are in greater demand and have more power to find the employment situation they want or stay busy working on a contingent basis.

The human resource outsourcing industry involves transitioning various functions handled by internal human resources and labor procurement to outside service providers on a permanent or project basis. Human resource departments are faced with increasingly complex operational and regulatory requirements, a tightening recruitment market, an expanding talent technology landscape, and pressure to achieve efficiencies, which increase the need to migrate non-core functions to outsourced providers. The human resource outsourcing industry includes RPO and MSP solutions which allow customers to more effectively find and engage high-quality talent, leverage talent acquisition technology, and scale their talent acquisition function to keep pace with changing business needs. PeopleScout is a leader in RPO and MSP services, which are in the early stages of their adoption cycles, and therefore, we believe they continue to have significant growth potential. 
 Our solutions address the following key trends contributing to anticipated RPO growth:

• | Talent access and engagement: As the competition for talent, shortage of skilled workers, and changes in worker demographics continue to increase, customers are relying on RPO providers to seamlessly blend talent acquisition processes and technology to more effectively access, identify and engage the best talent. RPO providers bring experience building talent communities, meeting candidates where they are, leveraging innovative talent technology, and facilitating effective recruitment marketing and candidate communication strategies.


• | Leveraging talent acquisition technology: Automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming talent acquisition and the fragmented talent technology ecosystem is becoming more crowded, with significant investments flowing in and new technology coming online rapidly. RPO providers are continuously identifying, evaluating and investing in new technology to leverage as part of their talent technology stack to best meet today’s candidate’s expectations of a personalized, mobile-optimized and efficient hiring process. RPO providers are uniquely positioned to successfully integrate and deploy new talent technology based on the volume of candidate engagements they manage and their understanding of the talent landscape, thereby reducing the investments required to be made by customers.


• | Scalability: RPO providers can add significant scalability to a company’s recruiting and hiring efforts, including accommodating seasonal, project or peak hiring needs without sacrificing quality. Providers also help customers increase efficiency and drive better performance by standardizing processes and reducing time to fill and onboard the best fit talent into a customer’s organization, and enabling customers to focus on their core business.

Our solutions address the following key trends contributing to anticipated MSP growth: 

• | Vendor consolidation and cost savings: As an organization’s spend on contingent workforce rises, it becomes increasingly interested in reducing the administrative burden of managing multiple outside vendors, having consistency among contractors and processes, and maintaining robust performance tracking and analytics. Vendor consolidation can achieve significant efficiencies through enhanced scale and cost advantages such as single point of contact, standardized contracts, and consolidated invoicing and reporting.


• | Access to talent: An MSP solution allows a company access to a large variety of staffing vendors with the efficiency of working with one supplier. An MSP can access numerous vendors to find the best talent at the best price more quickly, thereby delivering a better outcome for the customer.


• | Compliance pressure: Demand for temporary employee sourcing and workforce vendor management solutions is driven by increasing work eligibility legislation and compliance monitoring to ensure correct worker classification in order to properly

address tax withholding, overtime, Social Security, unemployment and health care obligations to avoid government penalties and lawsuits. 
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Market leadership through organic growth of our specialized workforce solutions. 
Our customers have a variety of challenges in running their businesses, many of which are unique to the industries in which they operate, their competitive pressures, and business performance. We are industry leaders dedicated to staffing solutions tailored to our customers’ needs and the industries in which they operate. Our differentiated solutions keep pace with their changing needs and are as follows: 

• | We will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our market presence for specialized blue-collar staffing services and expand our geographical reach through new physical locations, expand use of existing locations to provide the full range of blue-collar staffing services, and dispatch of our temporary workers to areas without branches. Continued investment in specialized sales, recruiting and service expertise will create a more seamless experience for our customers to access all of our services with more comprehensive solutions to enhance their performance and our growth. Our service lines offer complementary workforce solutions with unique value propositions to meet our customers’ demand for talent.


• | We will continue to invest in technology that increases our ability to attract more customers and employees as well as reduce the cost of delivering our services. We are committed to leveraging technology to improve the temporary worker and customer experience. Our technological innovation makes it easier for our customers to do business with us and easier to connect workers to work opportunities. We are making significant investments in online and mobile applications to improve the access, speed and ease of connecting our customers with both high-quality temporary and permanent employee workforce solutions.


◦ | We introduced our mobile application, JobStackTM, and completed the roll out to our temporary workers in 2017. We expect to fully roll out JobStackTM to our customers in 2018. This will create a virtual exchange between our workers and customers, which will allow our branch resources to expand their recruiting and sales efforts and service delivery. We expect JobStackTM will increase the competitive differentiation of our services, expand our reach into new demographics, and improve both service delivery and work-order fill rates.


◦ | We introduced a mobile-first, cloud-based proprietary platform, AffinixTM, in 2017 that creates a consumer-like candidate experience and streamlines the sourcing process within PeopleScout’s talent solutions. AffinixTM delivers speed and scalability while leveraging artificial intelligence, recruitment marketing, machine learning, predictive analytics and other emerging technology with one-point applicant tracking system and vendor management system integration and single sign-on. Currently, AffinixTM is available exclusively to PeopleScout customers and is continuously evolving to make the end-to-end process seamless for the candidate.


• | We are well positioned for growth by providing customers with the talent and flexible workforce solutions they need to enhance business performance. Our customers utilize our workforce solutions to improve the performance of their businesses. With growing demand for improved productivity and accessing temporary workers, our customers are looking for a full range of workforce services.


• | We are recognized as an industry leader for RPO services. The RPO industry is in the early stages of its adoption cycle, and therefore, we believe it has significant growth potential. The success of early adopters is generating greater opportunity to expand our service offering. We have a differentiated service that leverages innovative technology for high-volume sourcing and dedicated client service teams for connecting people to opportunities. We have a track record of helping our customers reduce the cost of hiring, add significant scalability to recruiting and hiring, and access numerous sources to prospect for the best talent quickly, thereby delivering a better outcome for the customer. Companies are facing rapidly changing employment demographics, shortage of talent, and dynamic changes to how people connect to work opportunities. Our solution addresses these growing challenges.


• | Our MSP solution is focused on domestic middle-market companies with a growing dependence on contingent labor. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to supply blue-collar temporary workers to our customers and, with our MSP solution, manage the full range of their contingent labor needs.

Growth through strategic acquisitions.
Strategic acquisitions continue to be a key growth strategy with a focus on globalizing our RPO services. We believe we have a core competence in assessing, valuing and integrating acquisitions culminating in higher shareholder returns. We are excited about the future of the staffing industry and human resource outsourcing and believe we can continue to create shareholder value through 
Page - 8

acquisitions, which expand our workforce solutions in high-growth markets, enhance our use of technology to better serve our customers, and increase our own efficiency.
CUSTOMERS
Our customers range from small and medium-sized businesses to Fortune 100 companies. 
During fiscal 2017, we served approximately 108,000 customers in industries including construction, energy, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution, waste and recycling, transportation, aviation, hospitality, general labor, and many more. Our ten largest customers accounted for 17.6% of total revenue for fiscal 2017, 19.9% for fiscal 2016 and 25.5% for fiscal 2015. Our single largest customer for fiscal 2017 accounted for less than 3.0% of total company revenue.
No single customer represented more than 10.0% of total company revenue for fiscal 2017 or 2016. One customer, Amazon, Inc. (“Amazon”), represented 13.1% of total company revenue for fiscal 2015. Amazon represented 2.2% and 6.2% for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 5,500 full-time equivalent employees. 
TEMPORARY WORKERS
Our PeopleReady and PeopleManagement services placed approximately 443,000 temporary workers on assignments with our customers during fiscal 2017. We recruit temporary workers daily so that we can be responsive to the planned and unplanned needs of the customers we serve. We attract our pool of temporary workers through our proprietary mobile applications, online resources, extensive internal databases, advertising, job fairs and various other methods. We identify the skills, knowledge, abilities and personal characteristics of a temporary worker and match their competencies and capabilities to a customer’s requirements. This enables our customers to obtain immediate value by placing a highly productive employee on the job site. We use a variety of proprietary programs and methods for identifying and assessing the skill level of our temporary workers when selecting a particular individual for a specific assignment and retaining those workers for future assignments. We believe that our programs and methods enable us to offer a higher quality of service by increasing productivity, decreasing turnover, reducing absenteeism, and improving worker safety.
We provide a bridge to permanent, full-time employment for thousands of temporary workers each year. Workers also come to us because of the flexibility we offer to fill a short-term financial need and/or provide longer-term contingent flexible labor opportunities. Workers may be assigned to different jobs and job sites, and their assignments could last for as little as a few hours or extend for several weeks or months. We provide our workers meaningful work and the opportunity to improve their skills. We are considered the legal employer of our workers, and laws regulating the employment relationship are applicable to our operations. We consider our relations with our temporary workers to be good. 
We remain focused and committed to worker safety. We have developed an integrated risk management program that focuses on loss analysis, education and safety improvement programs to reduce our operational costs and risk exposure. We regularly analyze our workers’ compensation claims to identify trends. This allows us to focus our resources on those areas that may have the greatest impact on us, price our services appropriately, and adjust our sales and operational approach in these areas. We have also developed educational materials for distribution to our customers and workers to address specific safety risks unique to their industry.
COMPETITION
Contingent staffing services 
The strongest staffing services competitor in a particular market is a company with established relationships and a track record of meeting the customer’s needs. We compete with other large publicly-held staffing companies as well as privately-owned staffing companies on a national, regional and local level. We also experience competition from internet-based companies providing a variety of flexible workforce solutions. Competition exists in attracting customers as well as qualified temporary workers for our customers. No single company has a dominant share of the industry. Competitive forces have historically limited our ability to raise our prices to immediately and fully offset increased costs of doing business, some of which include increased temporary worker wages, costs for workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance and health care.
The most significant competitive factors are price, ability to promptly fill customer orders, success in meeting customers’ expectations of recruiting temporary workers, and appropriately addressing customer service issues. We believe we derive a competitive advantage from our service history, and our specialized approach in serving the industries of our customers. Our national presence, industry specialization, investment in technology, and proprietary systems and processes, together with 
Page - 9

specialized programs focused on worker safety, risk management, and legal and regulatory compliance are key differentiators from many of our competitors.
Human resource outsourcing
The strongest competitors are companies specializing in RPO services and business process outsourcing companies that also offer RPO services. No one provider dominates the market. Competition also includes internal human resource departments that have not or are not considering outsourcing. The most significant competitive factors for RPO services are the ability to reduce customer cost by deploying an RPO solution and reducing the internal human resource cost structure of our customers. Important factors for success in RPO services include the ability to add significant scalability to a customer’s recruiting and hiring efforts, including accommodating seasonal and irregular hiring; the ability to increase efficiency by standardizing processes and facilitating transitions for candidates and employees; and the ability to source the most attractive talent at the best price. Our tailored solutions, customer partnership, proprietary technology and service delivery are key differentiators from many of our competitors.
CYCLICAL AND SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS
The workforce solutions business has historically been cyclical, often acting as an indicator of both economic downturns and upswings. Customers tend to use temporary workers to supplement their existing workforce and generally hire permanent workers when long-term demand is expected to increase. As a consequence, our revenues tend to increase quickly when the economy begins to grow. Conversely, our revenues also decrease quickly when the economy begins to weaken and thus temporary staff positions are eliminated, permanent hiring is frozen, and turnover replacement diminishes. 
Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations for contingent staffing services. Demand is lower during the first and second quarters, in part due to limitations to outside work during the winter months and slowdown in manufacturing and logistics after the holiday season. Our working capital requirements are primarily driven by temporary worker payroll and customer accounts receivable. Since receipts from customers lag payroll to temporary workers, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth. Demand for contingent labor peaks during the third quarter for outdoor work and the fourth quarter for manufacturing, assembly, warehousing, distribution and logistics for the holiday season.
REGULATION
Our services are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations. We continuously monitor legislation and regulatory changes for their potential effect on our business. We invest in technology and process improvements to implement required changes while minimizing the impact to our operating efficiency and effectiveness. Regulatory cost increases are passed through to our customers to the fullest extent possible.
