 This year, 2018, marks 30 years of doing business for Insight. Across three decades, we have evolved with the industry. Each strategic pivot has been made in pursuit of helping our clients run their businesses smarter. Insight began operations in Arizona in 1988, incorporated in Delaware in 1991 and completed its initial public offering in 1995. Our corporate headquarters are located in Tempe, Arizona. From our original location in the United States, we expanded nationwide and then entered Canada in 1997 and the United Kingdom in 1998. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth, we continued to increase our geographic coverage and expand our technical capabilities. Our major acquisitions were as follows: 
 

 | 2006  Acquired Software Spectrum, Inc., and expanded our footprint in EMEA and APAC and strengthened our software and related services capabilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 2008  Acquired Calence, LLC in North America and MINX Limited in the United Kingdom, and enhanced our global technical expertise around higher-end networking and communications technologies, as well as managed services and security;

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 2017  On January 6, 2017, we acquired Datalink Corporation (Datalink), a leading provider of IT services and enterprise data center solutions based in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, and strengthened our position as a leading IT solutions provider with deep technical expertise delivering data center solutions to clients on premise or in the cloud. On September 26, 2017, we acquired Caase Group B.V. (referred to herein as, Caase.com), a Dutch cloud service provider, and strengthened our ability to deliver Intelligent Technology Solutions to our clients in the Netherlands, with a view to expanding into the wider European region in the near future.

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 
 
Our Purpose and Values 
 Our purpose is: We build meaningful connections to help businesses run smarter. We live by our core values of Hunger, Heart and Harmony, which set the tone for our business and define who we are. Our core values are: 

 | Hunger  Our insatiable desire to create new opportunities for our clients and our business is apparent in everything we do.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Heart  We seek to impact the lives of the people we serve positively by always putting our clients, partners and teammates first.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Harmony  We invite perspective, and we consistently celebrate each others unique contributions as we work together to bring the best solutions to our clients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that these values strengthen the overall Insight experience for our clients, partners and teammates (we refer to our customers as clients, our suppliers as partners and our employees as teammates). 
 Our Market 
 The worldwide total addressable market for information technology is forecasted to be $3.7 trillion annually according to Gartner, a leading IT research and advisory company. Based on our analysis of Gartner market data, we believe the top 10 most comparable global solution providers represent less than 10% of the worldwide total addressable market. We believe our addressable worldwide market in the indirect sales IT channel represents approximately $612 billion in annual sales and for the year ended December 31, 2017, our net sales of $6.7 billion represented approximately 1% of that highly diverse market. We believe that we are well positioned in this highly fragmented global market with locations in 20 countries and have the capabilities to provide clients with hardware, software provisioning and related services and solutions across the globe. 
Our Value Proposition 
 As the IT industry evolves, our value proposition to our clients continues to evolve. The increased complexity across the technology ecosystem, combined with the continual emergence of new trends and offerings, has made it difficult for most clients to effectively manage their IT environments. We consult with our clients regarding their IT hardware and software product and services needs and help our clients define, architect, implement and manage their IT solutions. 
 We are well positioned to participate in the market as IT continues to transform. Our value drivers include: 
 

 | Deep knowledge in client-relevant solution areas
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | History of adapting our business model to respond to new technology trends, including the cloud
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Differentiated consulting, technology and managed services offerings
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Ability to scale to serve clients of all sizes and across many verticals
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Strong partner relationships with top market positions
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | Global footprint with local presence in key markets
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | Flexible capital structure to support future growth, including additional acquisitions
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that Insight has a unique position in the market to gain profitable market share by offering Intelligent Technology Solutions that empower our clients to manage their IT environments so they can drive meaningful business outcomes today and transform their operations for tomorrow. 
 We believe that Insights unique advantages include: 
 

 | Our global scale and coverage  we have the capabilities to serve clients across the globe with hardware, software provisioning and related services and with integrated technology solutions in multiple countries directly or through our partner network.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our operational excellence and systems  we offer a broad selection of hardware and software products with access to billions of dollars in virtual inventory and efficient supply chain execution, as well as product fulfillment and logistics capabilities, management tools and technical expertise.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our partner alignment  we have a multi-partner approach and have deep relationships with leading product manufacturers, software publishers and distribution partners, as well as emerging cloud and other technology partners, to service our global portfolio of commercial and public sector clients with the integrated IT solutions that make the most sense for their IT environments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our data center transformation skills  in support of our long-term strategy, in January 2017, we completed the acquisition of Datalink, a leading provider of IT services and enterprise data center solutions, adding deep technical expertise and complementary services offerings to our internally developed solutions and increasing our addressable market opportunity in hybrid cloud and other high-growth data center categories.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our next-generation tech skills  we quickly adapt to new technology trends and innovation and, with our acquisition of BlueMetal in 2015, continued our evolution as thought leaders in emerging technologies that help transform our clients businesses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our App development and Internet-of-Things (IoT) expertise  we were recognized as Microsofts Worldwide Partner of the Year for IoT as well as Mobile App Development in each of the past two years and, combined with our hardware and software expertise, we are well-positioned to deliver holistic connected product and IoT solutions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our digital platform  we have customizable client portals, primarily in North America, which allow clients to streamline procurement and processes through a self-service online tool, drive standardization and optimize reconciliation. We also have a best-in-class digital marketing engine to bring scalable solutions to the mid-market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our services solutions  we can scale to help organizations of all sizes and have well-developed services capabilities focused on four solutions areas: supply chain optimization, connected workforce, cloud and datacenter transformation and digital innovation, that represent the ways we help our clients with the demands they face, as discussed in more detail below.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Business Strategy 
 Our long-term strategy remains consistent and includes three components: 
 

 | Grow our core business;
--+------------------------


 | Grow services sales in our key solutions areas; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | Accelerate with cloud.
--+-----------------------

 Grow our core business. We believe that our core business is strong and continues to present opportunities for growth. We believe that Insight is uniquely positioned to help our clients manage their business effectively today and also transform to meet their changing needs tomorrow. Our balanced portfolio of manufacturer and publisher brands, extensive e-commerce and logistics capabilities and differentiated services capabilities allow us to tailor our offerings based on the size and complexity of the needs of our clients. As a global provider of integrated solutions to business and government clients, we believe we are well-positioned relative to our competitors in several markets. Our go-to-market model leverages both centralized and local market sales and technical and support resources to efficiently serve and advise our clients. 
 In each of our geographic operating segments we are focused on driving our growth objectives by acquiring new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients by increasing the types of products and services they buy from us. In North America, we have a local market presence in key cities where we have invested in sales, technical and service delivery resources to drive growth with existing and new clients, particularly in the large account client space. In addition, we drive expansion in specific service/solution areas with key partners. We are also concentrating our efforts on growing our business with mid-sized and large clients in certain vertical markets, including federal government, state and local governments, K-12 education, healthcare and service providers, and have invested in both local market and centralized sales resources to drive these efforts. In EMEA, we are focused on increasing our share in the mid-market and public sector by increasing sales of software and certain hardware categories across the business. We continue to expand our services capabilities in the region and to leverage strategic partner relationships and service-delivery vendors to bring software, cloud and collaboration solutions to our clients. Our APAC operating segment, which is largely comprised of software sales, is engaged in growing sales in the mid-market and enterprise space and in the development of specialized software services, particularly in the areas of software license optimization and cloud.

Grow services sales in our key solutions areas. The IT market has become more complex and clients are looking for solutions providers to help them navigate the rapidly changing environment. We believe that our core business plus our recent strategic acquisitions provide an integrated foundation that we can leverage to better serve our clients. We have identified four key solutions areas that capitalize on this foundation and include robust offerings to help our clients with the demands they face. Our services capabilities provide significant value-add to our clients, driving stronger client relationships and higher margins. Our key solutions areas are: 
 

 | Supply Chain Optimization  We help our clients invest smarter so they can manage today and transform for the future. By optimizing their supply chain, we can help our clients maximize resources and do more today so they can invest in the future.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Connected Workforce  We help our clients employees work smarter so they can manage and transform their businesses. By connecting their workforces, we help our clients create meaningful employee experiences that fuel productivity as well as attract and retain essential talent.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cloud and Data Center Transformation  We help our clients run workloads smarter so they can transform business. By defining and navigating cloud and data center platforms, we help our clients optimize and modernize their business.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Digital Innovation  We help our clients innovate smarter so they can create meaningful connections with their customers. By innovating their digital business, we help our clients monetize existing offerings, create new revenue streams and drive differentiation across their customer experience.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Accelerate with cloud. Private, public and hybrid cloud solutions provide flexible, reliable, secure and affordable solutions for delivering critical IT functions, such as email, data security, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and more. Cloud solutions have become more mainstream, and adoption continues to increase across markets and verticals. Key market imperatives in the adoption of cloud solutions are speed to market, flexibility, scalability and availability. We have invested in, and will continue to invest in, technical tools and resources to provide clients with the assessment, migration, integration and managed services required to simplify the cloud adoption decision, whether that decision results in a private, public or hybrid cloud environment. 
 We also continue to invest in our global cloud management platform, which serves as a marketplace for our clients to buy and manage their cloud subscriptions with options that enhance their Software as a Service (SaaS) and IaaS management capabilities. 
 Components of our cloud management platform include: 
 

 | A focus on small to medium-sized clients, providing them with the ability to learn, solve, buy, and manage cloud products and services via our online experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A similar online experience and capabilities for our larger enterprise clients with added IT as a Service Broker (ITaaSB) capabilities allowing larger IT organizations to centrally provide cloud offerings while maintaining the manageability and visibility they require.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, we have a strong global position in the service provider and independent software vendor (ISV) market. Building on our existing capabilities in this market, we have developed a cloud portfolio for our service provider clients to resell to their customers, offering them revenue diversification with minimal investment. We also plan to expand our cloud management platform capabilities and deliver cloud portal platforms that provide e-commerce and subscription management capabilities to our service provider clients.

Our Offerings 
 Our offerings in North America and certain countries in EMEA and APAC include a suite of IT hardware, software and services solutions. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC segments are largely software and certain software-related services. On a consolidated basis, hardware, software and services represented approximately 58%, 32% and 10%, respectively, of our net sales in 2017. This compares to 54%, 37% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales in 2016, and 54%, 38% and 8%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales in 2015. Additional detailed sales mix information by operating segment, including a discussion of changes in our classification of certain revenue streams during 2017, can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 and in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Prior year results were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation, resulting in 3% of our consolidated net sales being reclassified from software to services in both 2016 and 2015. These reclassifications had no effect on consolidated total net sales. 
Services Solutions Offerings 
 We have developed solutions that integrate hardware, software and services to help businesses run smarter within our key solutions areas. Our core solutions include: 
 Supply Chain Optimization  Growing pressure on IT budgets and increasing trends in outsourcing of non-core functions are changing what clients choose to build versus buy. We provide outsourcing services our clients desire, including management of client infrastructure and end-user operations to drive IT return on investment. 
 

 | Product Life Cycle: Source, procure, stage, configure, integrate, test, deploy and maintain IT products spanning endpoints to infrastructure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Infrastructure Management: 24x7 remote management of clients server/storage/network infrastructure through our ISO-certified Remote Network Operating Center (RNOC).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Connected Workforce  The consumerization of IT, increase in the millennial population and proliferation of alternate work models is transforming the workplace. We provide our clients workforce with tools to enable and enhance employee productivity and retention. 

 | Insight Managed Office: Desktop and notebook devices coupled with cloud-based productivity solutions, deployed through a modern, over the air deployment model, managed by Insights 24x7 Service Desk. In addition, we see growing demand for Device-as-a-Service.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Insight Managed Mobility: Tablet and cellular-based devices, paired with cloud-based applications and Insights 24x7 Service Desk to deliver an end-to-end managed experience where clients can outsource their highly complex mobility environments to Insight in an as-a-service style model.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Insight Managed Collaboration: Offerings that allow clients to outsource their highly complex voice, conferencing and collaboration/team applications, delivering cloud-based redeployment of modern technologies managed for our clients with both Insights onsite and remote Service Desk support professionals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Insight Managed Deployment: Service level agreement-based outsourcing of distributed devices and technology, or edge, deployment and support. This comprises multi-site deployments, coupled with dedicated, onsite desktop support technicians coupled with 24x7 Service Desk.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Cloud and Data Center Transformation  Consumption-based models and technology convergence are reinventing decades-old infrastructure business models. We optimize our clients public and private infrastructure to enable customer and workforce objectives best suited to their workload and business requirements. 
 

 | Hybrid Cloud: On-premise converged infrastructure (private cloud) augmented by off-premise public cloud integrated, managed and secured.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Intelligent Network: Core WAN, LAN, wireless and security solutions to seamlessly connect Hybrid Cloud, Branch Infrastructure and end users.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Intelligent Endpoints: Digital signage, kiosk, tablet and smartphone endpoints integrated with off-the-shelf software applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Intelligent Applications: Custom-developed applications to enable client-to-customer engagement. These applications are increasingly cloud-based and mobile-centric.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 
 

 | Modern Applications: Custom-developed mobile, cloud and IoT applications. Typically, these applications are specific to the client vertical market, e.g., healthcare, financial services or retail.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have invested in cloud, mobility, big data and security capabilities and expertise to enable our key solutions areas and continuously seek to identify client-relevant technology solutions. 
 Cloud. Cloud computing represents an evolution in the IT world. Cloud-based SaaS, whereby clients subscribe to software that is hosted either by the software publisher or a dedicated third-party hosting company, is prevalent in the Connected Workforce and Cloud and Data Center Transformation solutions highlighted above. In addition, public IaaS and converged infrastructure private cloud represent growing portions of Hybrid Cloud solutions. We help clients assess readiness, architect appropriate solutions and migrate to both public and private cloud infrastructures. 
 Mobility. Our clients must engage differently with their customers and fully engage their workforce whether they are at work, at home or on-the-go. We help clients do so through solutions starting with Insight Managed Mobility, an as-a-service like Enterprise Mobility Management (EMS) solution for employees, and modern customer-facing solutions, such as mobile Point of Sale (mPOS) and mobile commerce applications in the retail industry as well as mobile trading applications for brokerage customers in the financial services industry. 
 Big Data. Our clients are inundated with data that they struggle to interpret. We help turn this data into actionable insights with solutions such as weather-based predictive analytics to drive weekly marketing campaigns for consumer products and patient-based intake and health outcomes analysis to optimize nurse staffing. We expect the proliferation of sensors for IoT will fuel this data overload and drive further demand for these solutions. 
 Security. All of these solutions must be delivered without compromising customer, company or employee private information. We offer services for identity and access management, single-sign-on (SSO) and mobile-device-management (MDM) to protect end users. In addition, we provide network security and Security Incident Event Management (SIEM) solutions to secure our clients infrastructure. 
 Hardware Offerings 
 We offer products from hundreds of manufacturers, including such industry leaders as Cisco, HP Inc., Lenovo, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE), EMC, Microsoft, NetApp, Apple and IBM. Our scale and purchasing power, combined with our efficient, high-volume and cost effective direct sales and marketing model, allow us to offer competitive prices. We believe that offering choices from multiple partners enables us to better serve our clients by providing a variety of product solutions to address their specific business needs. 
 In addition to our distribution facilities, we have direct-ship programs with many of our partners, including manufacturers and distributors, allowing us to expand our product offerings without increasing inventory, handling costs or inventory risk exposure. As a result, we are able to offer billions of dollars of products in virtual inventory in fulfilling our performance obligations to our clients. Convenience and product options among multiple brands are key competitive advantages compared to manufacturers direct selling programs, which are generally limited to their own brands and may not offer clients a complete or best-in-class solution across all product categories. 
 Software Offerings 
 Our clients acquire software applications from us in the form of licensing agreements with software publishers or boxed products. We offer products from hundreds of publishers, including such industry leaders as Microsoft, Adobe, VMware, Symantec, McAfee, Citrix, IBM Software and Red Hat, as well as newer entrants, such as Box and 8x8. 
 As software publishers choose different models for implementing licensing agreements, businesses must evaluate the alternatives to ensure that they select the appropriate agreements and comply with the publishers licensing terms when purchasing and managing their software licenses. In addition to software provisioning, we offer holistic software solutions, including software licensing optimization and implementation consulting, to help our clients better understand their software needs, evaluate their existing software and provide options to optimize their assets.

Our Information Technology Systems 
 We have committed significant resources to the IT systems that we own and use to manage our business and believe that our success is dependent upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to our clients based on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems. Because these systems affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, partner relationships and programs, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and our voice and data networks, we have built redundancy into certain systems, maintain system outage policies and procedures and have comprehensive data backup. We are focused on driving improvements in sales productivity through upgraded IT systems to support higher levels of client satisfaction and new client acquisition, as well as garnering efficiencies in our business. 
 We operate under a single, standardized IT system across North America and APAC and a separate, single IT system platform in all countries in our EMEA operations. We plan to migrate our EMEA operations to the same IT system used in North America and APAC. 
 For a discussion of risks associated with our IT systems, see Risk Factors  Disruptions in our IT systems and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses, in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 
 Our Competition 
 The IT hardware, software and services industry is very fragmented and highly competitive. Our competition includes: 
 

 | Direct marketers and resellers, such as CDW (North America and United Kingdom), Systemax (Europe), Softchoice, Comparex, Connection, PCM, World Wide Technology, SHI, SoftwareONE, Computacenter, SCC, Bechtle, Cancom and Crayon;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | National and regional resellers, including value-added resellers, specialty retailers, aggregators, distributors, and to a lesser extent, national computer retailers, computer superstores, Internet-only computer providers, consumer electronics and office supply superstores and mass merchandisers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Product manufacturers, such as Dell, HP Inc., IBM, Lenovo and HPE;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Software publishers, such as IBM, Microsoft and Symantec;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | Systems integrators, such as Compucom Systems, Inc.;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | National and global service providers, such as IBM Global Services and HP Enterprise Services; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | E-tailers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Newegg, Buy.com and e-Buyer (United Kingdom).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The competitive landscape in the industry is continually changing as various competitors expand their product and services offerings. In addition, emerging models such as cloud computing are creating new competitors and opportunities in messaging, infrastructure, security, collaboration and other services offerings, and, as with other areas, we compete both with resellers and directly with manufacturers, publishers or other service providers for many of these offerings. Further, many of our manufacturer and publisher partners are also our competitors, as many sell directly to business customers, particularly larger corporate customers. 
 For a discussion of risks associated with the actions of our competitors, see Risk Factors  The IT hardware, software and services industry is intensely competitive, and actions of our competitors, including manufacturers and publishers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business, in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 
 Our Partners 
 We partner with market leaders offering the top technology brands as well as emerging entrants in the marketplace. During 2017, we purchased products and software from approximately 5,400 partners. Approximately 66% (based on dollar volume) of these purchases were directly from manufacturers or software publishers, with the balance purchased through distributors. Purchases from Microsoft accounted for approximately 26% of our aggregate purchases in 2017. No other partner accounted for more than 10% of purchases in 2017. Our top five partners as a group for 2017 were Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Tech Data (a distributor), Dell and HP Inc., and approximately 60% of our total purchases during 2017 came from this group of partners. Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of our product categories such that, with the exception of Microsoft, we are not dependent on any single partner for sourcing products.     
 
8 
 
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 
 
During 2017, sales of Microsoft, Dell and Cisco Systems products accounted for approximately 20%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. No other manufacturers products accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2017. Sales of product from our top five manufacturers/publishers as a group (Microsoft, Dell, Cisco Systems, HP Inc. and Lenovo) accounted for approximately 59% of Insights consolidated net sales during 2017. 
 We obtain incentives from certain product manufacturers, software publishers and distribution partners based typically upon the volume of sales or purchases of their products and services. In other cases, such incentives may be in the form of participation in our partner programs, which may require specific services or activities with our clients, discounts, marketing funds, price protection or rebates. Manufacturers and publishers may also provide mailing lists, contacts or leads to us. We believe that these incentives (or partner funding) and other marketing assistance allow us to increase our marketing reach and strengthen our relationships with leading manufacturers and publishers. 
 We are focused on understanding our partners objectives and developing plans and programs to grow our mutual businesses. We have invested in our digital marketing capabilities over the past two years. These digital marketing investments increase the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and client interactions. Our partners are taking notice, and we are emerging as a leader in our industry as we consistently outpace our competition in digital marketing. We implemented business intelligence tools that enable us to track performance in this area and demonstrate the return on our partners investments with us. We measure partner satisfaction regularly and hold quarterly business reviews with our largest partners to review business results from the prior quarter, discuss plans for the future and obtain feedback. Additionally, we host annual partner forums in North America, EMEA and APAC to articulate our plans for the upcoming year. 
 As we move into new service areas, we may become even more reliant on certain partner relationships. For a discussion of risks associated with our reliance on partners, see Risk Factors  We rely on our partners for product availability, competitive products to sell and marketing funds and purchasing incentives, which can change significantly in the amounts made available and the requirements year over year, in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 
 Our Teammates 
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed 6,697 teammates, of whom 2,512 were engaged in sales related activities, 2,024 were engaged in management, support services and administration activities, 2,007 were skilled, certified consulting and service delivery professionals and 154 were engaged in distribution activities. Our teammates in the United States are not represented by a labor union. Our workforces in certain foreign countries, such as Germany, have worker representative committees or work councils with which we maintain strong relationships. We believe our relations with our teammates are good, and we have never experienced a labor related work stoppage. 
 For a discussion of risks associated with our dependence on certain personnel, including sales personnel, see Risk Factors  We depend on certain key personnel, in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 
 Our Seasonality 
 We experience some seasonal trends in our sales of IT hardware, software and services. For example: 
 

 | software sales are typically higher in our second and fourth quarters, particularly the second quarter;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | business clients, particularly larger enterprise businesses in the United States, tend to spend more in our fourth quarter and less in the first quarter;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9 
 
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 
 

 | sales to the federal government in the United States are often stronger in our third quarter, while sales in the state and local government and education markets are stronger in our second quarter; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | sales to public sector clients in the United Kingdom are often stronger in our first quarter.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These trends create overall seasonality in our consolidated results such that sales and profitability are expected to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of the year.

 The majority of our backlog historically has been and continues to be open cancelable purchase orders. We do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is predictive of future results. 
Our Intellectual Property 
 We do not maintain a traditional research and development group, but we do develop and seek to protect a range of intellectual property, including trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain name rights, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property, relying for such protection on applicable statutes and common law rights, trade-secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements, as applicable, with teammates, clients, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Our principal trademark is a registered mark, and we also license certain of our proprietary intellectual property rights to third parties. We have registered a number of domain names, applied for registration of other marks in the United States and in certain international jurisdictions, and, from time to time, filed patent applications. We believe our trademarks and service marks, in particular, have significant value, and we continue to invest in the promotion of our trademarks and service marks and in our protection of them. 
 For a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property, see Risk Factors  We may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
