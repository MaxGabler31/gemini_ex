ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Narrative Description of Business
 
We are a mining company engaged in the business of the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. We currently own a 20% membership interest in Round Top, which entity holds two mineral property leases with the GLO to explore and develop a 950-acre rare earths project located in Hudspeth County, Texas, known as the Round Top Project. The leases, originally signed with primary terms of approximately 19 and 18 years, each currently have remaining terms of approximately eight years and provisions for automatic renewal if Round Top is in production. Round Top also holds prospecting permits covering 9,345 acres adjacent to the Round Top Project. The strategy with Round Top is to develop a metallurgical process to concentrate or otherwise extract the metals from the Round Top Project’s rhyolite, conduct additional engineering, design, geotechnical work, and permitting necessary for a bankable feasibility study and then to extract mineral resources from the Round Top Project. The Round Top Project has not established as of the date hereof that any of the properties contain any probable mineral reserves or proven mineral reserves under Item 1300 of Regulation S-K.
 
Rare earth elements are a group of chemically similar elements that usually are found together in nature – they are referred to as the “lanthanide series.” These individual elements have a variety of characteristics that are critical in a wide range of technologies, products, and applications and are critical inputs in existing and emerging applications. Without these elements, multiple high-tech technologies would not be possible. These technologies include:
 

● | cell phones,
--+-------------


● | computer and television screens,
--+---------------------------------


● | battery operated vehicles,
--+---------------------------


● | clean energy technologies, such as hybrid and electric vehicles and wind power turbines,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fiber optics, lasers and hard disk drives,
--+-------------------------------------------


● | numerous defense applications, such as guidance and control systems and global positioning systems,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | advanced water treatment technology for use in industrial and military, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | outdoor recreation applications.
--+---------------------------------

 
Because of these applications, global demand for REE is projected to steadily increase due to continuing growth in existing applications and increased innovation and development of new end uses. Interest in developing resources domestically has become a strategic necessity as there is limited production of these elements outside of China. Our ability to raise additional funds to continue to fund our participation interest in the Round Top Project may be impacted by future prices for REEs.
 
As a part of our ongoing operations, we will occasionally investigate new mining opportunities. We may also incur expenses associated with our investigations. These costs are expensed as incurred until such time when we have agreements in place to purchase such mining rights. See “Properties – Santa Fe Gold Corporation.”
 
History of the Round Top Project
 
In March 2013, we purchased the 54,990 acre surface lease covering the Round Top Project, known as the West Lease, from the Southwest Wildlife and Range Foundation (“Foundation”) for $500,000 and the issuance of 1,063,830 shares of our Common Stock. We also agreed to support the Foundation through an annual payment of $45,000 for ten years to support conservation efforts within the Rio Grande Basin and in particular engaging in stewardship of Lake Amistad, a large and well-known fishing lake near Del Rio, Texas. The West Lease provides exclusive surface access to the area for the potential development and mining of the Round Top Project.
 
In October 2014, we executed agreements with the GLO securing the option to purchase the surface rights covering the Round Top Project mine and plant areas and, separately, a lease to develop the water necessary for the potential Round Top Project mine operations. The option to purchase the surface rights covers approximately 5,670 acres over the mining lease and the additional acreage adequate to site all potential heap leaching and processing operations as currently anticipated by the Company. The option may be exercised for all or part of the option acreage at any time during the primary term of the mineral lease as defined above. The “primary term” of the GLO mineral leases and the option is through August 2030. The option can be kept current by an annual payment of $10,000. The purchase price will be the appraised value of the surface at the time of exercising the option. The ground water lease secures the right to develop the ground water within a 13,120-acre lease area located approximately 4 miles from the Round Top Project. The lease area contains five existing water wells. It is anticipated that all potential water needs for the Round Top Project mine operations will be satisfied by the existing wells covered by this water lease. This lease has an annual minimum production payment of $5,000 prior to production of water for the operation. After initiation of production payments of $0.95 per thousand gallons or $20,000 annually, whichever is greater, is required. This lease remains effective as long as the mineral lease is in effect.

In March 2015, we conducted a trial mining test during which we mined 500 tonnes of rhyolite, transported and crushed the ore to 80% passing an approximate one-inch screen. This rock is now stockpiled and is expected to be used in the contemplated pilot plant development.
 
In April 2015, we announced the execution of a uranium offtake agreement with UG USA, a subsidiary of Areva, now called Orano. According to the agreement, TMRC will supply up to 300,000 pounds of natural uranium concentrates (U308) per year based upon a pricing formula indexed to U308 spot prices at the times of delivery. The agreement is for a term of five years commencing in 2018 or as soon thereafter, contingent upon development and production at its Round Top Project, and contains other industry standard terms and conditions.
 
During 2017, TMRC in association with Penn State University, REE Tech and Inventure Renewables of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, jointly applied for a Department of Energy grant to evaluate the economic potential of rare earth elements associated with Appalachian coal deposits. Our group was awarded the first phase of this grant in October 2017. Work in progress consists of our identification of a resource, developing the physical metallurgy to concentrate the minerals (Penn State) and developing the CIX/CIC process to separate the individual rare earth elements and to separate and refine various other elements including iron and aluminum. In August 2019, we published a PEA prepared in accordance with Canadian NI 43-101 specifications. The PEA calls for a 20,000 tonnes per day heap leach operation producing three basic revenue streams: (i) a REE stream, (ii) a tech metal stream that includes lithium and uranium, and (iii) a variety of industrial and fertilizer sulfate products.
 
Cautionary Note
 
Cautionary Note to Investors: The PEA has been prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 — Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) — CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended. The Company has voluntarily had the PEA prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 but the Company is not subject to regulation by Canadian regulatory authorities and no Canadian regulatory authority has reviewed the PEA or passed upon its accuracy or compliance with NI 43-101. The terms “mineral reserve”, “proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101. These definitions differ from the definitions in Item 1300 of Regulation S-K under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Under Item 1300 of Regulation S-K standards, a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. In addition, the terms “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource” while defined in NI 43-101 and Item 1300 of Regulation S-K are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. “Inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of “contained ounces” in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute “reserves” by Item 1300 of Regulation S-K standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information in the PEA contains descriptions of our mineral deposits that may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Round Top Project as described in the PEA currently does not contain any known proven or probable mineral reserves under Item 1300 of Regulation S-K reporting standards. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in the Registrant’s latest reports filed with the SEC. U.S. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any defined resources in these categories will ever be converted into Item 1300 of Regulation S-K compliant reserves.
USA Rare Earth Agreement
 
In August 2018, the Company and Morzev Pty. Ltd. (“Morzev”) entered into an agreement (the “2018 Option Agreement”) whereby Morzev was granted the exclusive right to earn and acquire a 70% interest, increasable to an 80% interest, in the Round Top Project from the Company by funding certain expenditures described below. The 2018 Option Agreement contained customary representations, warranties and covenants. In September 2018 and October 2018, the Company and Morzev entered into minor, non-substantive amendments to the 2018 Option Agreement and, in connection with the agreement, Morzev purchased 646,054 shares of Company Common Stock for $140,000 in November 2018. Morzev began engaging in business as USA Rare Earth and in May 2019 notified the Company that it was nominating USA Rare Earth , LLC (“USARE”) as the optionee under the terms of the 2018 Option Agreement. In August 2019, the Company and USARE entered into an amended and restated option agreement as further amended on June 29, 2020 (the “2019 Option Agreement”), whereby the Company restated its agreement to grant USARE the exclusive right to earn and acquire a 70% interest, increasable to an 80% interest, in the Round Top Project from the Company by funding certain expenditures described below. The 2019 Option Agreement has substantially similar terms to the 2018 Option Agreement except that that 2019 Option Agreement acknowledges the investment by USARE into the Company and recognized a broader range of expenditures advancing the Round Top Project as contributing to the total $10,000,000 earn-in commitment for the initial 70% interest. In order to acquire and earn the 70% interest in the Round Top Project, USARE was required to perform and complete the following:

● | commit to expend a total of $2,500,000 for mining operations on the Round Top Project prior to December 13, 2020 (inclusive of the $140,000 Morzev 2018 stock purchase) which was achieved by expenditure commitments USARE made on December 10, 2019; and

USA Rare Earth was granted the option to acquire an additional 10% in the Round Top Project by paying to the Company $3,000,000.
 
On May 17, 2021, and in accordance with the terms of the Option Agreement, the Company and USARE entered into a contribution agreement (“Contribution Agreement”) whereby the Company and USARE contributed assets to Round Top, at the time a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for their ownership interests in Round Top, of which the Company now owns membership interests equating to 20% of Round Top and USARE owns membership interests equating to 80% of Round Top. Concurrently therewith, the Company and USARE as the two members entered into a limited liability company agreement (“Operating Agreement”) governing the operations of Round Top which contains customary and industry standard terms as contemplated by the Option Agreement. USARE will serve as manager of Round Top and Mr. Gorski, on behalf of the Company, will serve as one of the three members of the management committee.
 
Upon entry into the Contribution Agreement, the Company assigned the following contracts and assets to Round Top in exchange for its 20% membership interest in Round Top:
 

● | the assignment and assumption agreement with respect to the mineral leases from the Company to Round Top;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the assignment and assumption agreement with respect to the surface lease from the Company to Round Top;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the assignment and assumption agreement with respect to the surface purchase option from the Company to Round Top;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the assignment and assumption agreement with respect to the water lease from the Company to Round Top; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the bill of sale and assignment agreement of existing data and other relevant contracts and permits with respect to Round Top owned by the Company.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

and USARE assigned the following assets to Round Top (or the Company, as applicable) for its 80% membership interest in Round Top:
 

● | cash to Round Top to continue to fund Round Top operations in the amount of approximately $3,761,750 comprising the balance of the $10 million required expenditure to earn a 70% interest in Round Top;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cash in the amount of $3 million to the Company upon exercise of the USARE option to acquire from the Company an additional 10% interest in Round Top, resulting in the aggregate ownership interest of 80% in Round Top;

The Operating Agreement provides for the following:
 
Interests. Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, USARE owns membership interests equating to 80% of Round Top and the Company owns membership interests equating to 20% of Round Top. These ownership interests will be adjusted further under a variety of circumstances, including a decision by a member not to participate fully in a program and budget (“Budget”). USARE’s contribution of approximately $3,761,750 in cash to Round Top was used first to fund operations pursuant to the initial Budget. Subsequently, USARE and the Company will be obligated, subject to an election to dilute, to fund further expenditures in proportion to their respective ownership interests. We funded $1,937,332 during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. In accordance with the Round Top Budget of approximately $77.1 million during the fiscal year (of which the Company’s portion is approximately $15.4 million), the Company does not have sufficient capital to fund its total cash calls and expected G&A expenses during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2023; accordingly, we will be required to raise additional capital to fund our obligations during this fiscal year. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary capital to fund our cash calls and expected G&A expenses. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 
Cash Calls. USARE, as manager, will issue monthly cash calls pursuant to adopted Budgets. Both parties, as members, will have 10 days after receipt of such a billing to meet the cash call. Failure to meet a cash call results in dilution; provided that successive failures in the same budgetary period can result in accelerated dilution or a default loan at a default interest rate. If a member (the “Delinquent Member”) does not contribute all or any portion of any additional capital contribution that such member is required to contribute (the “Default Amount”), then the other member (the “Non-Defaulting Member”) may elect to contribute the Default Amount to Round Top, or not to contribute the Default Amount to Round Top and, in both cases, the interests of the members will be recalculated. If the default by the Delinquent Member is the second or any subsequent default during the period of any adopted Budget, the Non-Defaulting Member may elect to contribute the Default Amount to Round Top on behalf of the Delinquent Member and to reduce the ownership interest of the Delinquent Member by an amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to: (i) 150%; multiplied by the Default Amount; divided by (ii) the aggregate contributed capital of all members (determined after taking into account the contribution of the Default Amount on behalf of the Delinquent Member). The interest of the Non-Defaulting Member will be increased by the reduction in the interest of the Delinquent Member.
 
Management. A management committee will make the major decisions of Round Top, such as approval of Budgets, and the manager will implement such decisions. The management committee consists of three representatives of the members, with two being appointed by USARE and one by the Company (initially being Dan Gorski). The representatives vote the ownership percentage interests of their appointing member.
Management Committee Meetings. Meetings will be held every three months unless otherwise agreed. For matters before the management committee that require a vote, voting is by simple majority except for certain “major decisions” that require a unanimous vote. So long as the Company maintains a 15% or greater ownership interest, the nine decisions identified in the bullet points below require unanimous approval. If the Company’s ownership interest falls below 15%, the number of unanimous decisions is reduced to five (being the first five bullet points below). If the Company is acquired by a REE mining company or sells its ownership interest to a REE mining company, in each case who elects a majority of the Company’s board, this unanimous approval requirement can be suspended by USARE, at its option. The major decisions requiring unanimous approval, as set forth above, are:

● | approval of an amendment to any Budget that causes the Budget to increase by 15% or more, except for emergencies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other than purchase money security interests or other security interests in Round Top equipment to finance the acquisition or lease of Round Top equipment used in operations, the consummation of a project financing or the incurrence by Round Top of any indebtedness for borrowed money that requires the guarantee by any member of any obligations of Round Top;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | substitution of a member under certain circumstances and dissolution of Round Top;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance of an ownership interest or other equity interest in Round Top, or the admission of any person as a new member of Round Top, other than in connection with the exercise of a right of first offer by a member;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the redemption of all or any portion of an ownership interest, except for limited circumstances provided for in the Operating Agreement;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a decision to grant authorization for Round Top to file a petition for relief under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, to consent to such relief in any involuntary petition filed against Round Top by any third party, or to admit in writing any insolvency of Round Top or inability to pay its debts as they become due, or to consent to any receivership of Round Top;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | acquisition or disposition of significant mineral rights, other real property or water rights outside of the area of interest as set forth in the Operating Agreement or outside of the ordinary course of business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the merger of Round Top into or with any other entity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | the sale of all or substantially all of Round Top’s assets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

Manager. The manager will manage, direct and control operations in accordance with Budgets, will prepare and present to the management committee proposed Budgets, and will generally oversee and implement all of the day to day activities of Round Top. The manager will conduct necessary equipment and materials procurement and property and equipment maintenance activities, with all operations to be conducted in accordance with adopted Budgets. Before completion of the initial Budget, the manager will propose the next Budget. The Company will have the ability to accept, comment on and propose rejection of the proposed Budget and the manager is obligated to negotiate with the Company in good faith to develop an acceptable Budget. Voting for the adoption of such next proposed program and Budget will be by a simple majority vote.

Each member has the right to elect not to contribute fully or not to contribute at all to an adopted Budget. If a member does not contribute fully or at all, the other member has the right to make up some or all of the shortfall. In either case, the ownership interests of the members are recalculated and the non-contributing member is “diluted” on a straight-line basis. The same process is applied if the manager proposes to amend an adopted Budget by more than 15% and the proposal is approved.
 
Reports. The manager shall provide to the management committee periodic reports, including statements of accounts reflecting in detail the charges and credits to the business account during the preceding month, quarterly progress reports that include statements of expenditures and comparisons of such expenditures to the adopted Budget, summaries of data, and a final report after completion of a Budget.
Distributions. Cash in excess of authorized reserves will be distributed to the members on a periodic basis as determined by the management committee. No member will have the right to demand distributions in kind. Round Top will be required to make tax distributions to each member. USARE will have the right to purchase products at fair value or to market and sell products to third parties. If, during any period, products have been produced by Round Top and are available for sale but are not sold and a cash call or cash calls are made, then USARE is obligated to fund the monthly cash call or monthly cash calls on behalf of the Company, at no cost or expense to the Company, and the monthly cash call or monthly cash calls will be recovered by USARE solely out of the Company’s proportional interest in such products when sold.
Permitted Transfers. Certain transfers are permitted under the Operating Agreement, including transfers to affiliates or through certain mergers or other forms of business reorganization. A member may also encumber its ownership interest provided that if the ownership interest is foreclosed upon, the other member has a pre-emptive right to acquire such ownership interest at the foreclosure sale. If the transfer is a “permitted transfer,” the transferee is automatically admitted as a member; otherwise unless the other member agrees, the transferee is only an economic interest holder with no voting or other rights held by a member.
Right of First Offer. If a member desires to transfer all or a portion of its ownership interest to a third party (other than a permitted transfer), it may do that without the consent of the other member so long as it gives the other member the first right to purchase its ownership interest on the same terms. If the other member does not elect to purchase the ownership interest on such terms, the member may sell its ownership interest on such terms and the transfer will be a permitted transfer.
 
Drag-Along Right. If USARE accepts a bona fide offer to purchase its entire ownership interest and all other rights under the Operating Agreement from an unrelated third party, the Company will then be obligated to sell its entire ownership interest and all other rights under the Operating Agreement to the unrelated third party on the same terms and conditions as are accepted by USARE.
 
Involuntary Resignation – Elimination of Interest. If a member’s ownership interest is reduced through dilution to less than 5%, the member will be deemed to have resigned from Round Top and will relinquish its ownership interest to Round Top, in exchange for the right to receive 5% of net proceeds, if any, from the sale of products by Round Top.
Operations of the Round Top Project
 
During the current fiscal year, Round Top is expected to fund the expenditure of approximately $77.1 million to optimize the leaching and developing of the CIX/CIC processing of the Round Top Project. Initial process design work will be carried out at USARE’s facility in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. Pending completion of the initial process development, this facility will either be relocated to or replicated at the Round Top Project where a pilot plant is expected to be established. This work will consist of mining and crushing approximately 40,000 tonnes of rhyolite and setting up and equipping a facility to conduct pilot plant scale heap leaching. It is estimated that the Round Top Project will require additional time and further expenditure to complete a bankable feasibility study. In accordance with our current Budget, the Company does not have sufficient capital to fund its total cash calls (anticipated to be approximately $15.4 million) and expected G&A expenses during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2023; accordingly, we will be required to raise additional capital to fund our obligations during this fiscal year. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary capital to fund our cash calls and expected G&A expenses.
Trends – Markets
 
Rare earth elements, or REEs, are a group of chemically similar elements that usually are found together in nature – they are referred to as the “lanthanide series.” These individual elements have a variety of characteristics that are important in a wide range of technologies, products, and applications and are critical inputs in existing and emerging applications including: computer hard drives, cell phones, clean energy technologies, such as hybrid and electric vehicles and wind power turbines; multiple high-tech uses, including fiber optics, lasers and hard disk drives; numerous defense applications, such as guidance and control systems and global positioning systems; and advanced water treatment technology for use in industrial, military and outdoor recreation applications. As a result, global demand for REE is projected to steadily increase due to continuing growth in existing applications and increased innovation and development of new end uses. Interest in developing resources domestically has become a strategic necessity as there is limited production of these elements outside of China. Our ability to raise additional funds in order to complete our plan of exploration and, if warranted, development at the Round Top Project may be impacted by future prices for REEs.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The Round Top Project is currently in the exploration stage and as such Round Top does not require any significant raw materials in order to carry out its primary operating activities. Our primary operating objective is to continue to fund the exploration and development of the Round Top Project. The raw materials that the current operations of Round Top rely upon are gasoline and diesel fuel for the exploration vehicles and for the heavy equipment required to build roads and conduct drilling operations. Water is expected to be provided per service contract by Eagle Mountain Gang or through other sources.
Seasonality
 
Seasonality in the State of Texas is not a material factor to our operations for our project.
 
Competition
 
The mining industry is highly competitive. Round Top competes with numerous companies, substantially all of which have greater financial resources available to them. Round Top is, therefore, operating at a significant disadvantage in the course of acquiring mining properties and obtaining materials, supplies, labor, and equipment. Additionally, Round Top is and we are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of exploration and mineral property development. A large number of established and well-financed companies are active in the mining industry and will have an advantage over us if they are competing for the same properties. Nearly all such entities have greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than ourselves and, consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible mining properties and procuring the same.
 
China accounts for the vast majority of rare earth element production. While rare earth element projects exist outside of China, very few are in actual production. Further, given the timeline for current exploration projects to come into production, if at all, it is likely that the Chinese will be able to dominate the market for rare earth elements into the future. This gives the Chinese a competitive advantage in controlling the supply of rare earth elements and engaging in competitive price reductions to discourage competition. Any increase in the amount of rare earth elements exported from other nations, and increased competition, may result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of potential market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our operations. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors.
 
Government Approvals
 
The exploration, drilling and mining industries operate in a legal environment that requires permits to conduct virtually all operations. Thus permits are required by local, state and federal government agencies. Local authorities, usually counties, also have control over mining activity. The various permits address such issues as prospecting, development, production, labor standards, taxes, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, air quality, water use, water discharge, water quality, noise, dust, wildlife impacts, as well as other environmental and socioeconomic issues.
 
Prior to receiving the necessary permits to explore or mine, the operator must comply with all regulatory requirements imposed by all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project area. Very often, in order to obtain the requisite permits, the operator must have its land reclamation, restoration or replacement plans pre-approved. Specifically, the operator must present its plan as to how it intends to restore or replace the affected area. Often all or any of these requirements can cause delays or involve costly studies or alterations of the proposed activity or time frame of operations, in order to mitigate impacts. All of these factors make it more difficult and costly to operate and have a negative and sometimes fatal impact on the viability of the exploration or mining operation. It is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, causing those activities to be economically reevaluated at that time.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Government and Environmental Regulations
 
Mineral exploration, including mining operations are subject to governmental regulation. The Round Top operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation such as restrictions on production, price controls, tax increases, expropriation of property, environmental and pollution controls or changes in conditions under which minerals may be marketed. An excess supply of certain minerals may exist from time to time due to lack of markets, restrictions on exports, and numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include market fluctuations and government regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, allowable production and importing and exporting minerals. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately determined, and we are not aware of any probable government regulations that would impact the Company. This section is intended as a brief overview of the laws and regulations described herein and is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject matter.
Overview. Like all other mining companies doing business in the United States, Round Top is subject to a variety of federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations designed to protect the quality of the air and water, and threatened or endangered species, in the vicinity of its operations. These include “permitting” or pre-operating approval requirements designed to ensure the environmental integrity of a proposed mining facility, operating requirements designed to mitigate the effects of discharges into the environment during exploration, mining operations, and reclamation or post-operation requirements designed to remediate the lands affected by a mining facility once commercial mining operations have ceased.

Federal legislation in the United States and implementing regulations adopted and administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies—in particular, legislation such as the federal Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Forest Management Act, the Wilderness Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act—have a direct bearing on domestic mining operations. These federal initiatives are often administered and enforced through state agencies operating under parallel state statutes and regulations.
 
The Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act is the principal federal environmental protection law regulating mining operations in the United States as it pertains to water quality.
 
At the state level, water quality is regulated by the Environment Department, Water and Waste Management Division under the Water Quality Act (state). If our exploration or any future development activities might affect a ground water aquifer, it will have to apply for a Ground Water Discharge Permit from the Ground Water Quality Bureau in compliance with the Groundwater Regulations. If exploration affects surface water, then compliance with the Surface Water Regulations is required.
The Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act establishes ambient air quality standards, limits the discharges of new sources and hazardous air pollutants and establishes a federal air quality permitting program for such discharges. Hazardous materials are defined in the federal Clean Air Act and enabling regulations adopted under the federal Clean Air Act to include various metals. The federal Clean Air Act also imposes limitations on the level of particulate matter generated from mining operations.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires all governmental agencies to consider the impact on the human environment of major federal actions as therein defined.
 
Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA requires federal agencies to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. In order to facilitate the conservation of imperiled species, the ESA establishes an interagency consultation process. When a federal agency proposes an action that “may affect” a listed species, it must consult with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) and must prepare a “biological assessment” of the effects of a major construction activity if the USFWS advises that a threatened species may be present in the area of the activity.
National Forest Management Act. The National Forest Management Act, as implemented through title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, provides a planning framework for lands and resource management of the National Forests. The planning framework seeks to manage the National Forest System resources in a combination that best serves the public interest without impairment of the productivity of the land, consistent with the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960.
Wilderness Act. The Wilderness Act of 1964 created a National Wilderness Preservation System composed of federally owned areas designated by Congress as “wilderness areas” to be preserved for future use and enjoyment.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA imposes clean-up and reclamation responsibilities with respect to discharges into the environment, and establishes significant criminal and civil penalties against those persons who are primarily responsible for such discharges.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA was designed and implemented to regulate the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. It restricts solid waste disposal practices and the management, reuse or recovery of solid wastes and imposes substantial additional requirements on the subcategory of solid wastes that are determined to be hazardous. Like the Clean Water Act, RCRA provides for citizens’ suits to enforce the provisions of the law.
National Historic Preservation Act. The National Historic Preservation Act was designed and implemented to protect historic and cultural properties. Compliance with the Act is necessary where federal properties or federal actions are undertaken, such as mineral exploration on federal land, which may impact historic or traditional cultural properties, including native or Indian cultural sites.
 
In the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, we incurred minimal costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations in relation to our operating activities.
 
Employees
 
Including our executive officers, we currently have two full-time employees. We also utilize the services of qualified consultants with geological and mineralogical expertise as well as an individual for accounting services.

Investment Company Act Exclusion
 
Section 3(a)(9) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), provides that a company “substantially all of whose business consists of owning or holding oil, gas, or other mineral royalties or leases, or fractional interests therein, or certificates of interest or participation in or investment contracts relative to such royalties, leases, or fractional interests” is not an investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The Company has determined that this exemption applies to it giving consideration to the following four factors:
 
●         whether the exempted activity constitutes “substantially all” of our business;
 

○ | The Company has owned mineral leases since 2010, all of our business to date has been comprised of owning and developing the mineral leases and, after the May 2021 “farm-down” of its 100% interest in the mineral leases, substantially all of our business continues to be comprised of owning and holding a certificate of interest and a participation in the mineral leases owned by Round Top. The Company’s mineral assets historically, as well as the value of the certificate of interest at August 31, 2022, have been booked at cost in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). We have an accumulated deficit of approximately $39.8 million at August 31, 2022 as a result of owning and developing the Round Top Project.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
●         whether we own or trade in the mineral leases;
 

○ | The Company has owned the mineral leases, which are now owned by Round Top, since 2010 and neither the Company nor Round Top is in the business of dealing or trading in the mineral leases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
●         what qualifies as an eligible asset for purposes of the exception; and
 

○ | The statute specifically references mineral leases and our mineral leases were owned by the Company and are now owned by Round Top. In accordance with Regulation S-K Item 1300 that governs disclosure by registrants engaged in mining operations, the definition of mineral resource is “a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust.” Our rare earth elements and minerals underlying the mineral leases meet that definition, as well as does coal, silver, gold and other material mined for economic value by registrants involved in mining operations. The SEC staff has recognized that an excepted entity can also engage in related business activities such as exploring, developing, and operating the eligible assets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
●         what qualifies as a “certificate of interest or participation in” or an “investment contract relative to” the eligible assets.
 

○ | The statute allows a Company to own a “certificate of interest” or “participation in” the mineral leases. The SEC staff has advised that limited partnership interests and/or similar securities issued by entities that themselves own the leases constitute “certificate of interest or participation in or investment contracts” related to such leases. The Company’s 20% membership interest in Round Top constitutes a “certificate of interest” and a “participation in” the mineral leases that are owned by Round Top.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company intends to continue to conduct its business operations in order to continue to be excluded from the definition of an “investment company” under the 1940 Act.
