Item 1. Business
General
 
Wellesley Bancorp, Inc. Wellesley Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company” or “Wellesley Bancorp”) was incorporated in September 2011 to be the holding company for Wellesley Bank (the “Bank”) following the Bank’s conversion (the “Conversion”) from the mutual to stock form of ownership. On January 25, 2012, the Conversion was completed and the Bank became the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Also on that date, the Company sold and issued 2,407,151 shares of its common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, through which the Company received net offering proceeds of $21.2 million. The Company’s principal business activity is the ownership of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Bank. The Company does not own or lease any property, but instead uses the premises, equipment and other property of the Bank, with the payment of appropriate rental fees, as required by applicable laws and regulations, under the terms of an expense allocation agreement entered into with the Bank.
Wellesley Bank. Founded in 1911, Wellesley Bank is a Massachusetts chartered cooperative bank headquartered in Wellesley, Massachusetts. We operate as a community-oriented financial institution offering traditional financial services to consumers and businesses in our primary market areas of Wellesley, Newton, Needham, Cambridge, Boston and the surrounding communities. We attract deposits from the general public and use those funds to originate primarily residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans and construction loans, commercial business loans, and, to a lesser extent, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans. We conduct our lending and deposit activities primarily with individuals and small businesses in our primary market areas. In addition, we also provide investment management services for high net worth individuals, families, businesses, private partnerships, nonprofit organizations, foundations and trusts through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Wellesley Investment Partners, LLC, (“Wellesley Investment Partners”) a registered investment advisor.
 
The Bank’s and the Company’s executive offices are located at 100 Worcester Street, Suite 300, Wellesley, Massachusetts 02481 and its telephone number is (781) 235-2550.
 
Our website address is www.wellesleybank.com. Information on our website should not be considered a part of this document.
 
Wellesley Bank Charitable Foundation. In connection with the Conversion, the Company established the Wellesley Bank Charitable Foundation (the “Foundation”) through the contribution of $225 thousand in cash and 157,477 shares of common stock. The total contribution expense recognized by the Company in 2012 was $1.8 million pre-tax ($1.1 million after tax). The Foundation makes grants and donations to support charitable purposes within the communities served, currently or in the future, by the Company.

Market Area
 
We conduct our operations from our executive offices, five full-service branch offices located in Wellesley, Newton, Boston, and a limited-hour branch in Needham, Massachusetts. Our primary lending market is defined by our Community Reinvestment Act assessment area, and generally includes the communities of the greater Boston area. Due to our locations in and around Boston, our primary market area benefits from the presence of numerous institutions of higher learning, medical care and research centers and the corporate headquarters of several investment and financial services companies. The greater Boston metropolitan area also has many life science and high technology companies employing personnel with specialized skills. These factors affect the economic vitality of the region and impact the demand for residential homes, residential construction, office buildings, shopping centers, and other commercial properties in our market area.
 
Our market area is located largely in the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, Massachusetts/New Hampshire Metropolitan Statistical Area. Based on the 2010 United States census, the Boston metropolitan area is the 10th largest metropolitan area in the United States. Located adjacent to major transportation corridors, the Boston metropolitan area provides a highly diversified economic base, with major employment sectors ranging from services, manufacturing and wholesale/retail trade, to finance, technology and medical care.
 
Competition
 
We face significant competition for deposits and loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the financial institutions operating in our primary market area and from other financial service companies such as securities brokerage firms, credit unions and insurance companies. We also face competition for investors’ funds from money market funds and mutual funds. At June 30, 2018, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), we held 2.0% of the deposits in Norfolk County, which was the 13th largest market share among the 45 financial institutions with offices in Norfolk County. At June 30, 2018, we also held 13.5% of the deposits in the town of Wellesley, which was the third largest market share among the 15 financial institutions with offices in Wellesley. Some of the banks owned by large national and regional holding companies and other community-based banks that also operate in our primary market area are larger than we are and, therefore, may have greater resources or offer a broader range of products and services.
 
Our competition for loans comes from financial institutions, including credit unions, in our primary market area and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from nondepository financial service companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies.
 
We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend toward consolidation within the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet, and made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for gathering deposits and originating loans could limit our growth in the future.
 
Lending Activities
 
Residential Mortgage Loans. The largest segment of our loan portfolio is residential mortgage loans, which enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. At December 31, 2018, residential mortgage loans were $382.5 million, or 51.4%, of our total loan portfolio, consisting of $64.2 million and $318.3 million of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, respectively. We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years. Generally, our fixed-rate loans conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines and are originated with the intention to sell. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally adjust every three years after an initial fixed period that ranges from three to ten years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate equal to a specified percentage above a representative U.S. Treasury index. Depending on the loan type, the maximum amount by which the interest rate may increase or decrease is generally 2% per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate caps range from 5% to 6% over the initial interest rate of the loan.
 
Borrower demand for adjustable-rate loans, as compared to fixed-rate loans, is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, the ability of borrowers to qualify for longer-term fixed-rate loans under regulatory guidelines, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to the interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria, competitive market conditions and regulatory requirements.

While residential mortgage loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. Additionally, our current practice is generally to (1) sell to the secondary market newly originated 15 year or longer-term conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, and (2) to hold in our portfolio non-conforming loans, shorter-term fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. Generally, conforming fixed-rate loans are sold to third parties with servicing released, although we have sold residential loans with servicing retained under certain conditions. Wellesley Bank’s portfolio lending generally consists of conforming and non-conforming adjustable-rate loans for owner-occupied and investor properties with loan-to-value ratios of up to 80%. Mortgage amortizations range from 15 to 30 years. We do not originate “interest only” mortgage loans on one-to-four family residential properties nor do we offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal such as “option ARM” loans where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on their loan. Additionally, we generally do not offer “subprime loans” (loans that are made with low down payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments or bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity) or “Alt-A” loans (loans to borrowers having less than full documentation).
 
We will make loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 90% (occasionally to 95% for first time home buyers and other qualified borrowers on an exception basis); however, we generally require private mortgage insurance for loans with a loan-to-value ratio over 80%. We require all properties securing mortgage loans in excess of $250 thousand to be appraised by a licensed real estate appraiser. We generally require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Exceptions to these lending policies are based on an evaluation of credit risk related to the borrower and the size of the loan. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for loans on properties located in a flood zone.
 
In an effort to provide financing for first-time buyers, we offer adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loan programs. We offer mortgage loans through this program to qualified individuals and originate the loans using modified underwriting guidelines, modified loan conditions and reduced closing costs.
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans. We also offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate properties, including loans secured by multi-family real estate properties. At December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans were $148.0 million, or 19.9%, of our total loan portfolio, inclusive of $32.0 million in multi-family real estate loans. The commercial real estate loan portfolio consisted of $25.0 million in fixed-rate loans and $123.0 million in adjustable-rate loans at December 31, 2018. Our primary focus is individual commercial real estate loan originations to small and mid-size owner occupants and investors in amounts between $1.0 million and $5.0 million. The average size for loans in this portfolio was $1.2 million at December 31, 2018. Our commercial real estate and multi-family loans are generally secured by properties used for business purposes such as office buildings, warehouses, retail facilities and apartment buildings. In addition to originating these loans, we also occasionally participate in commercial real estate loans with other financial institutions located primarily in Massachusetts.
 
We originate fixed-rate and adjustable-rate commercial real estate and multi-family loans for terms up to 30 years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally adjust every three, five, and seven or ten years and typically are adjusted to a rate equal to a specified percentage above the corresponding Federal Home Loan Bank Classic Advance borrowing rate. Most of our adjustable-rate commercial real estate and multi-family loans adjust every five years and amortize over a 25 year term. Since 2010, commercial real estate and multi-family loan originations are generally subject to an interest rate floor. Loan amounts do not exceed 80% of the property’s appraised value at the time the loan is originated.
 
At December 31, 2018, our largest commercial real estate loan was for $9.9 million and was secured by a memory care facility. At December 31, 2018, our largest multi-family real estate loan was for $4.0 million and was secured by an income producing property. Both of these loans were performing according to their original repayment terms at December 31, 2018.
 
Construction Loans. At December 31, 2018, construction loans were $106.7 million, or 14.3%, of our total loan portfolio. We primarily originate construction loans to contractors and builders, and to a lesser extent, individuals, to finance the construction of residential dwellings. We also make construction loans for commercial development projects, including small industrial buildings and retail and office buildings. Our construction loans generally are fixed-rate, interest-only loans that provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which usually ranges from 12 to 24 months. The interest rates on our construction loans generally give consideration to the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal and market conditions. Construction loans generally are made with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75% of the appraised market value estimated upon completion of the project, but may be made up to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80%. As appropriate to the underwriting and appraisal process for certain property classes, a “discounted cash flow analysis” may be utilized. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also will require an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Generally, our construction loans do not provide for interest payments to be funded by interest reserves.

We lend to experienced local builders and our construction loans are primarily secured by properties located within a 25 mile radius of Wellesley, Massachusetts. All borrowers are underwritten and evaluated for creditworthiness based on past experience, debt service ability, net worth analysis including available liquidity, and other credit factors. We require personal guarantees on all construction loans. Advances are only made following an inspection of the property confirming completion of the required progress on the project and an update to the title completed by a bank approved attorney.
 
Most of our loans for the construction of residential properties are for residences being built that have not been sold prior to commencement of construction (speculative loans). Construction loans secured by speculative residential loan projects totaled $71.0 million or 9.6% of our loan portfolio, loans secured by owner-occupied residential real estate totaled $25.7 million, or 3.5% of our loan portfolio, and loans secured by other commercial loan projects totaled $10.0 million or 1.4% of our loan portfolio.
 
At December 31, 2018, our largest outstanding construction loan relationship was for multiple speculative residential projects aggregating $12.0 million, of which $1.2 million was outstanding. These projects are secured by properties located in communities in our primary lending area, which are to be built and marketed as single family residences. This relationship was performing according to its original repayment terms at December 31, 2018.
 
Commercial Business Loans. We make commercial business loans primarily in our market area to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships and small businesses. At December 31, 2018, commercial business loans were $66.9 million, or 9.0% of our total loan portfolio. Commercial lending products include term loans, revolving lines of credit and equipment loans. Commercial business loans and lines of credit are made with either variable or fixed rates of interest. Variable rates generally are based on the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. Fixed-rate business loans are generally priced by considering the prime rate and the comparable cost of funding, typically from published rates of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. Commercial business loans typically have shorter maturity terms and higher interest spreads than real estate loans, but generally involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. We focus our efforts on small- to medium-sized, privately-held companies with local or regional businesses that operate in our market area. In addition, commercial business loans are generally made to existing customers having a business or individual deposit account, or new borrowers who are required to establish appropriate deposit relationships with Wellesley Bank, if not already a depositor.
 
When making commercial loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, their borrowing history, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral, primarily accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. These loans are generally supported by personal guarantees. At December 31, 2018, our largest commercial business loan was $8.9 million. The loan is secured by land and leasehold improvements and was performing according to its original terms at December 31, 2018. Our largest commercial lines of credit were $2.0 million and were secured by all business assets of the related companies. At December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding balances on the lines of credit and they were performing according to their original terms.
 
Home Equity Lines of Credit. We offer home equity lines of credit, which are generally secured by owner-occupied residences. At December 31, 2018, home equity lines of credit were $39.5 million, or 5.3% of our total loan portfolio. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest with ten-year draws amortized over 15 years that are indexed to the Prime Rate as published by The Wall Street Journal and generally are subject to an interest rate floor. Our home equity lines of credit generally have a monthly variable interest rate. We offer home equity lines of credit with cumulative loan-to-value ratios generally up to 85%, when taking into account both the balance of the home equity loans and first mortgage loan.
 
The procedures for underwriting home equity lines of credit include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral to the proposed loan amount. The procedures for underwriting residential mortgage loans apply equally to home equity loans.
 
Other Consumer Loans. We occasionally make fixed-rate second mortgage loans, automobile loans, loans secured by passbook or certificate accounts and overdraft loans. At December 31, 2018, other consumer loans were 163 thousand or 0.1% of total loans.

The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount.
 
Loan Underwriting and Monitoring
 
Fixed-Rate Residential Mortgage Loans. Our fixed-rate mortgage loans conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines and are originated with the intention to sell. A small portfolio of fixed-rate loans are held in the Bank’s portfolio, some of which may not conform to secondary market standards, yet are still high credit quality loans. The interest rate spread on these loans, which tend to have longer terms, are susceptible to rising interest rates as they are typically funded with shorter term funding. However, due to the size of our portfolio and the probability for these loans to pre-pay prior to maturity, the interest rate risk is manageable.
Adjustable-Rate Residential Mortgage Loans. Our adjustable-rate loans better offset the adverse effects on our net interest income in the event of an increase in interest rates, as compared to fixed-rate mortgages. However, the increased mortgage payments required of adjustable-rate loans in a rising interest rate environment could lead to an increase in delinquencies and defaults. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans help make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits.
Commercial Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate, including multi-family real estate, generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project and the borrower’s creditworthiness. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, where applicable, to provide annual financial statements on commercial real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise and credit history, and a certified appraisal documenting the value of the underlying property. We also require an environmental survey for commercial real estate loans over $500 thousand.
Construction Loans. Speculative construction financing of real estate properties is considered to involve a greater risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a speculative construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. As a result of the foregoing, speculative construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If we are forced to foreclose on a project before or at completion due to a default, there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. Construction financing of owner-occupied residential properties, while exhibiting some of the risks of speculative construction financing, is considered less risky as repayment of loan principal is generally a function of the borrower’s creditworthiness, and not typically based on the expected sale price of the property.
Commercial Business Loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, certain collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value.
Consumer Loans. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. Such cases often do not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.

Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales. Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary source of loan originations are our in-house loan originators, and to a lesser extent, local mortgage brokers, advertising, and referrals from customers. We occasionally participate with other financial institutions in commercial real estate loan transactions.
 
Our current practice is generally (1) to sell to the secondary market newly originated 15-year or longer-term conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, and (2) to hold in our portfolio non-conforming loans, shorter-term fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. Our decision to sell loans is influenced by prevailing market interest rate conditions and interest rate risk management. Generally, loans are sold to third parties with servicing released although we have sold residential loans with servicing retained under certain conditions. In addition, we may sell participation interests in commercial real estate loans to local financial institutions, primarily the portion of loans that exceed our borrowing limits or are in an amount that is considered prudent in concert with recognition of credit risk.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we originated loans totaling $309.5 million and $329.8 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold $8.5 million of loans originated for sale, all of which were residential mortgage loans. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold $11.7 million, all of which were residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no loans sold with recourse.
 
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending activities follow written, nondiscriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management. Loans in excess of $2.5 million must be authorized by a member of the Security Committee of the Board of Directors while loans in excess of $6.0 million must be authorized by a majority of the members of the Security Committee.
Loans-to-One Borrower Limit and Loan Category Concentration. The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is generally limited by statute to 20% of our capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of our capital stock, surplus account and undivided profits. Obligations secured by a first lien residential mortgage are excluded from the total borrower obligations for purposes of this computation. At December 31, 2018, our regulatory limit on loans-to-one borrower was approximately $13.0 million. At that date, our largest single borrower lending relationship was $11.1 million and consisted of multiple loans secured by commercial real estate and construction mortgages on mixed-use and retail properties. These loans were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms at December 31, 2018.
Loan Commitments. We issue commitments for fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans and other loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate residential mortgage loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers. Generally, these loan commitments expire after 60 days.
Investment Activities
 
We have legal authority to invest in various types of securities, including U.S. Treasury obligations, obligations of various government-sponsored enterprises and municipal governments, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and investment grade marketable equity securities. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we had no investments in derivative securities through December 31, 2018.
 
At December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities and bonds issued by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, state and municipal bonds, SBA and other asset-backed securities, and investment grade corporate bonds.
 
Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, to provide an alternate source of low-risk investments when demand for loans is weak and to generate a favorable return. Management has the responsibility for the investment portfolio subject to the guidelines established in our investment policy approved by the Board of Directors. Management works with Wellesley Investment Partners, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wellesley Bank and a registered investment advisor, in the day-to-day management of the investment portfolio. The Board of Directors reviews the status of the portfolio on a monthly basis. The Asset/Liability Committee, which meets on a quarterly basis, reviews an in-depth analysis of the portfolio including performance risk, credit risk and interest rate risk.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and financial market conditions, and competitive pricing behavior within our market.
Deposit Accounts. Deposits are attracted from within our market area based on reputation, by advertising and other marketing efforts, through online banking and mobile capabilities, and through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), savings accounts and certificates of deposit. In addition, we participate in a national market clearinghouse through which we offer competitively priced certificates of deposit to financial institutions and other corporate members of the clearinghouse. We also utilize brokered deposits. In addition to accounts for individuals, we also offer several commercial checking accounts designed for businesses operating in our market area and strongly encourage commercial borrowers to utilize our commercial business deposit products.
 
Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability to us, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing on a weekly basis. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates and to periodically offer special rates to attract deposits of a specific type or term.
 
Business Banking and Cash Management Services. We offer a variety of deposit accounts designed for the businesses operating in our market area. Our business banking deposit products include a commercial checking account and checking accounts specifically designed for small businesses. We also offer remote capture products for business customers to meet their online banking needs. Additionally, we offer a commercial NOW account with sweep features, automated clearinghouse (ACH) origination, on-line wire transfer, and money market accounts for businesses. We are seeking to increase our commercial deposits through the offering of these types of cash management products.
Borrowings. We utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston to supplement our supply of investable funds. The Federal Home Loan Bank functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank and are authorized to apply for advances utilizing certain of our whole first mortgage loans and other assets as collateral (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth or on the Federal Home Loan Bank’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. At December 31, 2018, we had advances outstanding with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston totaling $73.5 million, of which, short-term advances, those with original maturities less than one year, totaled $15.0 million. At December 31, 2018, we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately $117.6 million in additional funds from the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, we also had an available line of credit of $1.3 million with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston at an interest rate that adjusts daily. We had no overnight advances with the Federal Home Loan Bank on this date. All of our borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank are secured by a blanket lien on residential real estate loans.
 
The Co-operative Central Bank provides funds in the form of loans for liquidity purposes which are available to all cooperative member banks. Loan advances will generally be made on an unsecured basis up to $5.0 million provided the following: the aggregate loan balance is less than 5% of total deposits of the member bank; the member bank’s primary capital ratio is in excess of 5%; the member bank meets the required CAMELS rating; and, the quarterly and year-to-date net income before extraordinary items is positive. At December 31, 2018, we had $5.0 million of unsecured borrowing capacity with the Co-operative Central Bank, none of which was outstanding.
 
At December 31, 2018, we had the ability to borrow $6.8 million under a collateralized borrower-in-custody agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, none of which was outstanding. We also had a $5.0 million unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank, none of which was outstanding.
 
In December 2015, the Company issued $10.0 million of 6.0% fixed-to-floating rate, subordinated debentures maturing in 2025 to qualified institutional investors.

Wellesley Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. As a registered bank holding company, Wellesley Bancorp is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”).
 
The regulatory and supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and, for purposes of the FDIC, the deposit insurance fund, rather than for the protection of stockholders and creditors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, classification of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Massachusetts legislature, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of Wellesley Bancorp and Wellesley Bank. As is further described below, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and may affect the lending, investment and general operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies.
 
Set forth below is a summary of certain material statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to Wellesley Bancorp and Wellesley Bank. The summary is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Wellesley Bancorp and Wellesley Bank.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and will affect future lending and investment activities and general operations of depository institutions and their holding companies.

In particular, in 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revises their risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. See “—Federal Regulations—Capital Requirements.”
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with extensive powers to implement and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings associations, among other things, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings associations with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings associations with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with federal consumer protection and fair lending laws by their applicable primary federal bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations and gives state attorneys and state banking regulators general certain authority to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
 
On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA) amended some provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act. The amendments made by EGRRCPA provide for additional tailoring of various provisions of the federal banking laws. Specifically, EGRRCPA is intended to simplify some of the regulatory burden for smaller and mid-sized banking organizations. For example, on August 30, 2018, the Federal Reserve published an interim final rule implementing revisions to the small bank holding company policy statement. The asset threshold was raised from $1 billion to $3 billion to preclude small bank holding companies from maintaining consolidated regulatory capital ratios; allows for non-equity funding, such as subordinated debt, to fund growth; and, allows for an 18 month examination cycle for well-managed, well-capitalized banks.
 
Massachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision
 
General. As a Massachusetts-chartered cooperative bank, Wellesley Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations which govern, among other things, investment powers, lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve accounts, distribution of earnings and payment of dividends. In addition, Wellesley Bank is subject to Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights laws and regulations. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks or the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation is required for a Massachusetts-chartered bank to establish or close branches, merge with other financial institutions, issue stock and undertake certain other activities.
 
Massachusetts regulations generally allow Massachusetts banks, with appropriate regulatory approvals, to engage in activities permissible for federally chartered banks or banks chartered by another state. The Commissioner also has adopted procedures reducing regulatory burdens and expense and expediting branching by well-capitalized and well-managed banks.
 
Parity Regulation. In January 2015, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts adopted a law modernizing the Massachusetts banking law, which affords Massachusetts chartered banks greater flexibility compared to federally chartered and out-of-state banks. The new provisions of Massachusetts banking law took effect on April 7, 2015.
 
The Massachusetts banking legislation, among other things, attempts to synchronize Massachusetts laws with certain federal requirements in the same area, streamline the process for an institution to engage in activities permissible for federally chartered and out-of-state institutions, consolidate corporate governance statutes and provide authority for the Commissioner to establish a tiered supervisory system for Massachusetts-chartered institutions based on factors such as asset size, capital level, balance sheet composition, examination rating, compliance and other factors deemed appropriate.
 
Dividends. A Massachusetts stock bank may declare cash dividends from net profits not more frequently than quarterly. Noncash dividends may be declared at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited or paid if the bank’s capital stock is impaired. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years. Dividends from Wellesley Bancorp may depend, in part, upon receipt of dividends from Wellesley Bank. The payment of dividends from Wellesley Bank would be restricted by federal law if the payment of such dividends resulted in Wellesley Bank failing to meet regulatory capital requirements.
 
9

 

Loans to One Borrower Limitations. Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations to one borrower may not exceed 20% of the total of the bank’s capital, surplus and undivided profits.
 
Loans to a Bank’s Insiders. Massachusetts banking laws require that insider loans, or loans to officers, directors and trustees be made in accordance with Federal regulations. See “—Federal Regulations— Transactions with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders.”
 
Investment Activities. In general, Massachusetts-chartered banks may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized under the laws of the United States, or any state subject to certain conditions. Federal law imposes additional restrictions on Wellesley Bank’s investment activities. See “—Federal Regulations—Business and Investment Activities.”
 
Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Any Massachusetts bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be subject to sanctions for noncompliance, including revocation of its charter. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the bank’s business in an unsafe or unsound manner or contrary to the depositors’ interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. Upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank concerned. The Commissioner also has authority to take possession of a bank and appoint a liquidating agent under certain conditions such as an unsafe and unsound condition to transact business, the conduct of business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner or impaired capital. In addition, Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to Wellesley Bank permit private individual and class action law suits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damages and attorney’s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes.
Insurance Fund. All Massachusetts-chartered cooperative banks are required to be members of the Co-operative Central Bank, which maintains the Share Insurance Fund that insures cooperative bank deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance coverage. The Co-operative Central Bank is authorized to charge cooperative banks an annual assessment fee on deposit balances in excess of amounts insured by the FDIC.
 
Protection of Personal Information. Massachusetts has adopted regulatory requirements intended to protect personal information. The requirements are similar to existing federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, discussed below under “—Federal Regulations—Other Regulations,” that require organizations to establish written information security programs to prevent identity theft. The Massachusetts regulation also contains technology system requirements, especially for the encryption of personal information sent over wireless or public networks or stored on portable devices.
 
Massachusetts has other statutes or regulations that are similar to certain of the federal provisions discussed below.
 
Federal Regulations
 
Capital Requirements. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved revisions to their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules that implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called “Basel III,” and address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010, and loss absorbency rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements.
 
The rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective January 1, 2015, and revise the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios. The minimum capital level requirements applicable to Wellesley Bank are: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (3) a total capital ratio of 8%; and, (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The rules eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital. Instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 are grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less. The rules also establish a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the adequate regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and will result in the following minimum ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; and (3) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement is fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.

According to the recently passed EGRRCPA, an alternative capital framework is available for qualifying community banking organizations. For banks with total assets less than $10 billion, simplified calculations and reporting is available as long as the community bank leverage ratio is maintained above 9.0%. Otherwise, the Basel III rules apply. In November 2018, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a joint proposal that would simplify regulatory capital requirements for qualifying community banking organizations, as required by the EGRRCPA. Under the proposal, a community banking organization would be eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework if it has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9.0%. A qualifying community banking organization that has chosen the proposed framework would not be required to calculate the existing risk-based and leverage capital requirements. A firm would also be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be well capitalized for the agencies' prompt corrective action rules provided it has a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9.0%.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, the internal audit system, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits and, more recently, safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.
 
Business and Investment Activities. Under federal law, all state-chartered FDIC-insured banks have been limited in their activities as principal and in their debt and equity investments to the type and the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. Federal law permits exceptions to these limitations. For example, certain state-chartered cooperative banks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The maximum permissible investment is the lesser of 100% of Tier 1 capital or the maximum amount permitted by Massachusetts law. Any such grandfathered authority may be terminated upon the FDIC’s determination that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk or upon the occurrence of certain events such as the cooperative bank’s conversion to a different charter.
 
The FDIC is also authorized to permit state banks to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specified that a state bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary,” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes.
 
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
 
The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has at least 5% leverage capital, 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% total risk-based capital and 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has at least 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital and 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has less than 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital or 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has less than 3% leverage capital, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 6% total risk-based capital or 3% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has less than 2% tangible capital.
 
Transactions with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders. Transactions between a bank (and, generally, its subsidiaries) and its related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to 10% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with specified requirements. The law also requires that affiliate transactions be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution, as those provided to non-affiliates.
 
11

 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by a company to its executive officers and directors. The law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws, assuming such loans are also permitted under the law of the institution’s chartering state. Under such laws, a bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders (“insiders”), as well as entities such persons control is restricted. The law limits both the individual and aggregate amount of loans that may be made to insiders based, in part, on the bank’s capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are further limited to loans of specific types and amounts.
 
Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state banks, including Wellesley Bank. That enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC also has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under certain circumstances. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state nonmember bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.”
Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Deposit accounts in Wellesley Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250 thousand per separately insured depositor, pursuant to changes made permanent by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of its deposit insurance assessment. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned. The FDIC may adjust rates uniformly from one quarter to the next, except that no adjustment can deviate more than three basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking.
 
A material increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Wellesley Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of Wellesley Bank’s deposit insurance.
 
Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to establish or acquire branches and merge with other depository institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Wellesley Bank’s most recent FDIC CRA rating was “Satisfactory.”
 
Massachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA which is also applicable to Wellesley Bank. The Massachusetts version is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required to consider a bank’s record of performance under the Massachusetts law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. Wellesley Bank’s most recent rating under Massachusetts law was “Satisfactory.”

Federal Reserve System.  The Federal Reserve Board regulations require savings institutions to maintain noninterest earning reserves against their transaction accounts, primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts. For 2019, the regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $124.2 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $124.2 million. The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements. Wellesley Bank complies with the foregoing requirements.
Federal Home Loan Bank System.  Wellesley Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of twelve regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, Wellesley Bank is required to acquire and hold a specified amount of shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. As of December 31, 2018, Wellesley Bank was in compliance with this requirement.
Other Regulations

Holding Company Regulation
 
Wellesley Bancorp, as a bank holding company, is subject to examination, supervision, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. Wellesley Bancorp is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for Wellesley Bancorp to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company.
 
A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in nonbanking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are: (1) making or servicing loans; (2) performing certain data processing services; (3) providing securities brokerage services; (4) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (5) leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; (6) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (7) acquiring a savings association.
 
A bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including that its depository institutions subsidiaries are “well capitalized” and “well managed,” can opt to become a “financial holding company.” A “financial holding company” may engage in a broader array of financial activities than permitted a typical bank holding company. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. Wellesley Bancorp does not anticipate opting for “financial holding company” status at this time.
 
The Federal Reserve Board has established capital requirements generally similar to the capital requirements for state member banks described above, for bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. In 2013, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule implementing new capital standards for all bank holding companies with $500 million or more in total consolidated assets. See “—Federal Regulations—Capital Requirements.” On April 9, 2015, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System adopted final amendments to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. This final rule raises the asset threshold to qualify under the policy statement from $500 million to $1 billion in total assets, expands the statement’s scope to include savings and loan holding companies, revises the applicability of the board’s regulatory capital rules and revises certain reporting requirements. The policy statement facilitates the transfer of ownership of small community banks by allowing their holding companies to operate with higher levels of debt than would otherwise be permitted. While holding companies that meet the conditions of the policy statement are excluded from consolidated capital requirements, their depository institutions continue to be subject to minimum capital requirements. Eligible companies must also meet certain qualitative requirements with respect to nonbanking activities, off-balance sheet activities, and publicly-registered debt and equity. On August 28, 2018, the Federal Reserve Board issued an interim final rule expanding the applicability of the Federal Reserve Board's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, as required by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018.  The interim final rule raises the policy statement's asset threshold from $1 billion to $3 billion in total consolidated assets.  The policy statement also applies to savings and loan holding companies with less than $3 billion in total consolidated assets.  This interim final rule took effect on August 30, 2018.

A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted an exception to that approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions.
 
The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by using available resources to provide capital funds during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy and requires the promulgation of implementing regulations. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Wellesley Bancorp to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act makes depository institutions liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the insurance fund in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. That law would have potential applicability if Wellesley Bancorp ever held as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to Wellesley Bank.
 
Wellesley Bancorp and Wellesley Bank will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve System. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of Wellesley Bancorp or Wellesley Bank.
 
The status of Wellesley Bancorp as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act will not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.
 
Massachusetts Holding Company Regulation. Under Massachusetts banking laws, a company owning or controlling two or more banking institutions, including a cooperative bank, is regulated by the Massachusetts Division of Banks as a bank holding company. Each such bank holding company: (1) must obtain the approval of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation before engaging in certain transactions, such as the acquisition of more than 5% of the voting stock of another banking institution; (2) must register, and file reports, with the Massachusetts Division of Banks; and (3) is subject to examination by the Division of Banks. Wellesley Bancorp would become a bank holding company regulated by the Massachusetts Division of Banks if it acquires a second banking institution and holds and operates it separately from Wellesley Bank.
Federal Securities Laws. Our common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We are subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements under the Exchange Act.
Federal Income Taxation 
 
General. We report our income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The federal income tax laws apply to us in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly our reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us. Our federal income tax returns have not been audited in the most recent five year period. For its 2018 fiscal year, Wellesley Bank’s maximum federal income tax rate was 21.0%. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was signed into law, which decreased the federal tax rate to 21.0%, from 34.0%, beginning January 1, 2018. The fourth quarter of 2017 and full-year 2017 results reflect the impact of the enactment of TCJA, which resulted in an additional $979 thousand tax provision and a decrease in net income due to the revaluation of its net deferred tax asset at the enactment date.

Bad Debt Reserves. For taxable years beginning before June 30, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the Internal Revenue Code were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method. The reserve for non-qualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in 1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and the percentage of taxable income method for tax years beginning after 1995 and required savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves. Approximately $820 thousand of our accumulated bad debt reserves would not be recaptured into taxable income unless Wellesley Bank makes a “non-dividend distribution” to Wellesley Bancorp as described below.
Distributions. If Wellesley Bank makes “non-dividend distributions” to Wellesley Bancorp, the distributions will be considered to have been made from Wellesley Bank’s unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves, including the balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987, to the extent of the “non-dividend distributions,” and then from Wellesley Bank’s supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent of those reserves, and an amount based on the amount distributed, but not more than the amount of those reserves, will be included in Wellesley Bank’s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of Wellesley Bank’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid out of Wellesley Bank’s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be so included in Wellesley Bank’s taxable income.
 
The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Therefore, if Wellesley Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to Wellesley Bancorp, approximately one and one-half times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 21.0% federal corporate income tax rate. Wellesley Bank does not intend to pay non-dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves.
 
State Taxation
 
Financial institutions in Massachusetts file combined income tax returns with affiliated companies that are not security corporations. The Massachusetts excise tax rate for cooperative banks is currently 9.0% of federal taxable income, adjusted for certain items. Taxable income includes gross income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, plus interest from bonds, notes and evidences of indebtedness of any state, including Massachusetts, less deductions, but not the credits, allowable under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, except for those deductions relating to dividends received and income or franchise taxes imposed by a state or political subdivision. Carryforwards and carrybacks of net operating losses and capital losses are not allowed. Wellesley Bancorp’s state tax returns, as well as those of its subsidiaries, are not currently under audit.
 
A financial institution or business corporation is generally entitled to special tax treatment as a “security corporation” under Massachusetts law provided that: (1) its activities are limited to buying, selling, dealing in or holding securities on its own behalf and not as a broker; and (2) it has applied for, and received, classification as a “security corporation” by the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. A security corporation that is also a bank holding company under the Internal Revenue Code must pay a tax equal to 0.33% of its gross income. A security corporation that is not a bank holding company under the Internal Revenue Code must pay a tax equal to 1.32% of its gross income. Wellesley Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Wellesley Securities Corporation, is a Massachusetts securities corporation. As such, it has received security corporation classification by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, and does not conduct any activities deemed impermissible under the governing statutes and various regulations, directives, letter rulings and administrative pronouncements issued by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue.
