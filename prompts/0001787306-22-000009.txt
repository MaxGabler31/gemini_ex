Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for dermatological diseases with high unmet medical needs. Our current portfolio is comprised of highly differentiated topical treatments with significant potential to treat immune-mediated dermatological diseases and conditions. We believe we have built the industry's leading platform for dermatologic product development. Our strategy is to focus on validated biological targets, and to use our drug development platform and deep dermatology expertise to develop differentiated products that have the potential to address the major shortcomings of existing therapies in our targeted indications. We believe this strategy uniquely positions us to rapidly advance our goal of bridging the treatment innovation gap in dermatology, while maximizing our probability of technical success. 
Our lead product candidate, roflumilast cream, has successfully completed pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in plaque psoriasis, demonstrating symptomatic improvement and favorable tolerability in this population. We have submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of July 29, 2022. Roflumilast is a highly potent and selective phosphodiesterase type 4, or PDE4, inhibitor, an established biological target in dermatology, with multiple PDE4 inhibitors approved by the FDA for the systemic treatment of dermatological conditions. We are developing roflumilast cream for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, including psoriasis in intertriginous regions such as the groin, axillae, and inframammary areas, as well as atopic dermatitis. We have also successfully completed a long-term safety study of roflumilast cream in plaque psoriasis subjects, showing continued symptomatic improvement and favorable tolerability over a treatment period of 52 to 64 weeks. In atopic dermatitis, we have initiated three pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies: INTEGUMENT-1 and -2 are enrolling subjects six years of age or older and INTEGUMENT-PED is enrolling subjects between the ages of two and five years. We expect to provide topline data from each of INTEGUMENT-1 and -2 by the end of 2022. We intend to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for topical roflumilast cream for the treatment of atopic dermatitis patients aged six years or older in 2023 based on the results of INTEGUMENT-1 and -2. Due to the inherent challenges of enrolling young children in clinical trials, together with impacts on enrollment from COVID-19, we now expect to provide topline data from INTEGUMENT-PED in 2023. We intend to submit a subsequent sNDA for the younger age cohort based on INTEGUMENT-PED following the potential initial atopic dermatitis approval in patients aged six years or older. 
We are also developing a topical foam formulation of roflumilast, and have successfully completed Phase 2 clinical trials in both seborrheic dermatitis and scalp and body psoriasis. In seborrheic dermatitis, we initiated a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, with topline data anticipated in mid-year 2022. We also initiated a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in scalp and body psoriasis, with topline data anticipated in the second half of 2022. If these pivotal Phase 3 trials for roflumilast foam are positive, we expect the data to be a sufficient basis for an NDA submission to the FDA for each indication.
Beyond topical roflumilast, we are developing ARQ-252, a potent and highly selective topical Janus kinase type 1, or JAK1, inhibitor. In May 2021, we announced that the Phase 2 study of ARQ-252 in chronic hand eczema did not meet its primary endpoint, with further analyses of the study pointing to inadequate local drug delivery to the skin. Given these analyses, we also elected to terminate the Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating ARQ-252 as a potential treatment in vitiligo, as we began reformulation efforts to develop an enhanced formulation of ARQ-252 that delivers more active drug to targets in the skin. Additionally, we have formulation and nonclinical efforts continuing for ARQ-255, an alternative deep-penetrating topical formulation of ARQ-252 designed to reach deeper into the skin and hair follicle in order to potentially treat alopecia areata. The ARQ-255 formulation is separate and distinct from ARQ-252, and thus there are no implications to ARQ-255 from ARQ-252.

Dermatological diseases such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, hand eczema, alopecia areata, and vitiligo affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide each year, impacting their quality of life, and physical, functional, and emotional well-being. There are many approved treatments for these conditions, but a large opportunity remains due to issues with existing treatments. Topical treatments are used for nearly all patients, but existing topicals are limited by one or more of the following: modest response rates, side effects, patient adherence, application site restrictions, and limits on duration of therapy. Topical corticosteroids, or TCS, are commonly used as the first-line therapy for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis. While many patients see improvements, long-term TCS treatment carries the risk of a variety of significant side effects. As a result, TCS are typically used intermittently for brief periods, which can lead to disease flares when patients stop TCS therapy. In psoriasis, vitamin D analogs are also used, but have lower response rates than TCS and are frequently irritating. In atopic dermatitis, topical calcineurin inhibitors, or TCIs, and crisaborole (Eucrisa), a topical non-steroidal PDE4 inhibitor, are used, but have lower response rates than TCS and are associated with application site burning. TCIs also have a boxed warning for cancer risk. Topical ruxolitinib (Opzelura) was approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in September 2021, but carries an extensive boxed warning for numerous severe side effects, and is limited to short-term, intermittent use after failure of other treatments. In seborrheic dermatitis, in addition to TCS, topical antifungals are commonly used, but have limited efficacy.
Biologic and systemic therapies are also available for some diseases, but are typically indicated for a small percentage of the affected population. Biologics for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis have shown impressive response rates but are only indicated for the minority of patients with moderate-to-severe forms of disease, are expensive, and often face reimbursement and access restrictions. Treatment with oral systemic therapies such as methotrexate and apremilast (Otezla) has also been limited given modest symptomatic improvement and the frequency of adverse events. Additionally, many patients on biologic and systemic therapies still require adjunctive topical therapy to treat residual symptoms.
Given the limitations associated with existing treatments, we believe patients with inflammatory skin conditions and their dermatologists are dissatisfied with their current treatment options. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to leverage developments in other fields of medicine, particularly inflammation and immunology, to address the significant need for effective chronic treatments in immuno-dermatology. Our initial focus is to address patients’ significant need for innovative topical treatments that directly target molecular mediators of disease, have the potential to show significant symptomatic improvement, maintain a low risk of toxicity or side effects, and are suitable for chronic use on all areas of the body. Based on market research and our internal estimates, we estimate our primary addressable market opportunity, which focuses on U.S. patients treated by dermatologists with topical therapies, at 5 million patients across psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis. There are millions of additional U.S. patients suffering from chronic hand eczema, vitiligo, and alopecia areata, as well as millions of patients treated by physicians other than dermatologists for their psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage recent innovations in inflammation and immunology to identify molecules against validated biological targets in dermatology, and to develop and commercialize best-in-class products based on those molecules that address significant unmet needs in immuno-dermatology:
Key elements of our strategy include:
•Rapidly develop and commercialize our lead product candidate, roflumilast cream, for the treatment of patients with plaque psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Based on the clinical data generated to date, we believe roflumilast cream has the potential to be the best-in-class non-steroidal topical treatment, with symptomatic improvement in psoriasis patients similar to the combination of a high potency steroid and calcipotriene while potentially delivering a low risk of side effects and a favorable tolerability profile that enables chronic administration, including for pediatric patients. In plaque psoriasis, we have successfully completed pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as a long-term safety study. We have submitted an NDA to the FDA, and the FDA has set a PDUFA action date of July 29, 2022. In atopic dermatitis, we have initiated three pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies: INTEGUMENT-1 and -2 are enrolling subjects six years of age or older, and INTEGUMENT-PED is enrolling subjects between the ages of two and five years. We expect to provide topline data from each of INTEGUMENT-1 and -2 by the end of 2022. We intend to submit an sNDA for topical roflumilast cream for the treatment of atopic dermatitis patients aged six years or older in 2023 based on the results of INTEGUMENT-1 and -2. We expect to provide topline data from INTEGUMENT-PED in 2023 and submit a subsequent sNDA for the younger age cohort following the potential initial atopic dermatitis approval in patients aged six years or older. 
•Expand our addressable market with roflumilast foam. We are developing a foam formulation of roflumilast for the treatment of scalp and body psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis, diseases impacting hair-bearing areas of the body where a cream is not suitable. We have successfully completed Phase 2 clinical trials with roflumilast foam in both seborrheic dermatitis and scalp psoriasis, demonstrating promising efficacy and tolerability in both diseases. In seborrheic dermatitis, we initiated a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, with topline data anticipated in mid-year 2022. We also initiated a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in scalp and body psoriasis, with topline data anticipated in the second half of 2022. If these pivotal Phase 3 trials for roflumilast foam are positive, we expect the data to be sufficient basis for an NDA submission to the FDA for each indication.
•Establish an integrated development and commercial organization. We believe the concentrated prescriber base of the U.S. dermatology segment provides us with the opportunity to build a fully integrated commercial organization and targeted sales force for the commercialization of our product candidates among dermatology specialists. To further enhance the value of our product candidates, we may selectively seek partners to commercialize our products outside of the dermatology specialist segment, and to develop and commercialize our products outside of the U.S. market.
•Further expand our product portfolio through the development of ARQ-252/ARQ-255. We are developing ARQ-252 and ARQ-255, both of which contain a JAK1 inhibitor with a high relative selectivity to JAK1 over Janus kinase type 2, or JAK2, inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hand eczema and vitiligo, and potentially alopecia areata. Given its high relative selectivity to JAK1 over JAK2, we believe ARQ-252 and ARQ-255 have the potential to treat inflammatory diseases without causing the hematopoietic adverse effects associated with JAK2 inhibition, giving it the potential to be best-in-class. In May 2021, we announced that the Phase 2 study of ARQ-252 in chronic hand eczema did not meet its primary endpoint, with further analyses of the study pointing to inadequate local drug delivery to the skin. Given these analyses, we also elected to terminate the Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating ARQ-252 as a potential treatment in vitiligo, as we began reformulation efforts to develop an enhanced formulation of ARQ-252 that delivers more active drug to targets in the skin. Our formulation and nonclinical efforts for ARQ-255, an alternative deep-penetrating topical formulation of ARQ-252 designed to reach deeper into the skin in order to potentially treat alopecia areata, are continuing. The ARQ-255 formulation is separate and distinct from ARQ-252, and thus there are no implications to ARQ-255 from ARQ-252.
•Leverage our product development platform to continue innovating and developing novel new treatments for dermatological diseases. Our expertise in dermatological clinical development and commercialization allows us to identify areas of high unmet needs, and our product development platform may allow us to develop novel new treatments that address those needs, as it has already with roflumilast cream, roflumilast foam, and ARQ-252/ARQ-255. 
Index to Financial Statements

•Evaluate strategic opportunities to in-license best-in-class dermatology assets consistent with our core strategy. Leveraging our deep expertise in identifying promising drug candidates in dermatology, we will continue to seek best-in-class assets across treatment modalities directed against validated targets. We will continue to explore opportunities to in-license assets and develop them to address unmet medical needs in dermatology.
We believe one of our core strengths is that we have built the industry's leading platform for dermatology product development. This platform, coupled with our deep expertise in dermatology clinical development and commercialization, is the engine that allows us to generate our highly differentiated product candidates. Our platform has already generated several significant innovations, including:
•Our innovative topical formulation of roflumilast (patented)
•The pharmacokinetic characteristics relating to improving delivery and extending half-life of both the cream and foam formulations of topical roflumilast (patented)
•A novel topical cream without skin-drying surfactants (patent pending)
•The first topical treatment for seborrheic dermatitis with dual anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory action (patent pending)
•Our novel “4D” deep-penetrating formulation allowing topical delivery deeper in the dermis (patent pending).
Roflumilast Cream (ARQ-151)
Our lead product candidate, roflumilast cream, has the potential to offer symptomatic improvement in psoriasis patients similar to the combination of a high potency steroid and calcipotriene, a favorable tolerability profile, the ability to be used chronically, and little to none of the application site reactions associated with many existing topical treatments. Roflumilast cream is designed for simple once-a-day application for chronic use, does not burn or sting on application, and can be used on any part of the body, including sensitive or difficult-to-treat areas, such as the face and intertriginous regions. It quickly and easily rubs into the skin without leaving a greasy residue, does not stain clothing or bedding, or have an unpleasant smell. Roflumilast is a highly potent and selective PDE4 inhibitor that was approved by the FDA for systemic treatment to reduce the risk of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2011. Roflumilast has demonstrated a potency advantage of approximately 25x to in excess of 300x compared to the active ingredients in the two other FDA-approved PDE4 inhibitors, Eucrisa and Otezla.
We are currently developing roflumilast cream for plaque psoriasis, including intertriginous psoriasis, as well as atopic dermatitis. We have successfully completed pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as a long-term safety study, in plaque psoriasis. We have submitted an NDA to the FDA, and the FDA has set a PDUFA action date of July 29, 2022. In atopic dermatitis, we completed our Phase 2 proof of concept study and initiated our Phase 3 clinical program. The atopic dermatitis Phase 3 program includes 4 studies: two identical studies with approximately 650 subjects each, ages 6 and above (INTEGUMENT-1 and -2); a study with approximately 650 subjects ages 2-5 (INTEGUMENT-PED); and an open label extension study with up to 1,500 subjects (INTEGUMENT-OLE). We expect to provide topline data from each of INTEGUMENT-1 and -2 by the end of 2022. We intend to submit an sNDA for topical roflumilast cream for the treatment of atopic dermatitis patients aged six years or older in 2023 based on the results of INTEGUMENT-1 and -2. We expect to provide topline data from INTEGUMENT-PED in 2023 and submit a subsequent sNDA for the younger age cohort following the potential initial atopic dermatitis approval in patients aged six years or older.
In July 2018, we executed a licensing agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) for exclusive worldwide rights to roflumilast as a topical product in humans solely for dermatological indications. We have built our own intellectual property portfolio around topical uses of roflumilast, with issued and pending formulation, pharmacokinetic, and method-of-use patents in the United States and other jurisdictions from several distinct patent families, which should provide us with exclusivity for our product at least into 2037.

Plaque Psoriasis
Psoriasis Background
Psoriasis is an immune disease that occurs in about 3% of the U.S. population, representing approximately 8.6 million patients. About 90% of cases are plaque psoriasis, which is characterized by “plaques”, or raised, red areas of skin covered with a silver or white layer of dead skin cells referred to as “scale” (see figures below). Psoriatic plaques can appear on any area of the body, but most often appear on the scalp, knees, elbows, trunk, and limbs, and the plaques are often itchy and sometimes painful. At least 40% of plaque psoriasis patients have plaques on their scalp, about 15% have plaques in their intertriginous regions, approximately 10% have plaques on their face, and one in three has plaques on their elbows and knees. Each of these areas present a variety of treatment challenges which may be well suited to treatment with topical roflumilast. 
Psoriasis patients are generally characterized as mild, moderate, or severe, with approximately 75% experiencing a mild to moderate form of the disease and 25% experiencing a moderate-to-severe form of the disease. Pruritus (itching) is a particularly common and bothersome symptom for patients, which can be severe and impact sleep patterns. In addition, patients with plaque psoriasis can suffer substantial psychosocial impacts from their disease and have a 50% greater chance of depression than the general population.

Current Psoriasis Treatment Landscape
The vast majority of psoriasis patients are treated with topical therapies, of which there have been no novel treatments approved in over 20 years. Despite their widespread use, existing topical therapies all possess substantial shortcomings:
•Topical steroids are associated with a number of side effects, including, among others, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, skin atrophy (thinning), striae (stretch marks), and telangiectasia (spider veins). Some of these side effects are irreversible. Consequently, high potency topical steroids are not recommended for chronic use, and physicians generally will not prescribe them for treatment on the face or in the intertriginous regions.

•Vitamin D3 analogs provide substantially less symptomatic improvement than high potency steroids, and are frequently irritating. While they can be used chronically, tolerability issues with their use can be a challenge, and physicians generally will not prescribe them for use on the face or in the intertriginous regions.
•Vitamin D3/steroid combinations offer better symptomatic improvement than either of the two individual components alone, but still carry a risk of HPA axis suppression, and are limited in their duration of use. 
Because high potency steroids and combinations containing high potency steroids provide robust symptomatic improvement for psoriasis patients, most physicians initiate treatment for nearly all patients with them. However, due to the limitations on duration of treatment to between two and eight weeks, most physicians will switch the patient to a low- to mid-potency steroid or to a vitamin D analog to manage the patient’s psoriasis chronically. These “step down” options provide less symptomatic improvement and are often irritating. Also, rebound is a known challenge with steroids, where psoriasis returns even worse than before steroid treatment. As a result, patients are constantly cycling between effective short courses of high potency steroids and less effective “step down” maintenance treatments.
Treatment with biologics remains highly restricted. In the United States, less than 20% of moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients (equivalent to 6% of all psoriasis patients) are on biologic therapy. The uptake of biologics has remained limited due to multiple factors, including the fact that they are indicated only for use in moderate-to-severe patients, their high cost and patient co-payments, reimbursement and access restrictions, perceived risk of side effects, and patient fear of injection.
Treatment with non-biologic systemic therapy, such as methotrexate or Otezla is also limited. According to Decision Resources Group, non-biologic systemic therapy represents approximately 8% of patients worldwide and 11% of patients in the United States. The use of methotrexate has declined due to concerns about side effects and mandatory routine monitoring. Otezla has a limited U.S. market share in part due to its high annual price relative to topical treatments, modest symptomatic improvement, and frequent adverse events.
Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic Dermatitis Background
Atopic dermatitis is the most common type of eczema, affecting approximately 26 million people in the United States. Atopic dermatitis is the most common skin disease among children, with prevalence steadily increasing from 8% to 12% in the last two decades. Atopic dermatitis is characterized by a defect in the skin barrier, which allows allergens and other irritants to enter the skin, leading to an immune reaction and inflammation. This reaction produces a red, itchy rash, most frequently occurring on the face, arms and legs, and the rash can cover significant areas of the body (see figures below). The rash causes significant pruritus (itching), which can lead to damage caused by scratching or rubbing and perpetuating an ‘itch-scratch’ cycle.

Given the high proportion of pediatric patients, safety and tolerability of atopic dermatitis treatments is paramount. Atopic dermatitis imposes a substantial burden on the patient, parents, and family. Pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis can suffer from sleep disturbances, behavioral problems, irritability, crying, interference with normal childhood activities, and social functioning. Adults with atopic dermatitis also frequently suffer from sleep disturbances, emotional impacts, and impaired social functioning. Adults with atopic dermatitis also appear to be at a significantly increased risk of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation compared to the general population.
Current Atopic Dermatitis Treatment Landscape
The vast majority of atopic dermatitis patients are being treated with topical therapies, particularly low- to mid-potency topical steroids and TCIs, and these two classes of drugs constituted nearly all atopic dermatitis prescriptions in 2021. Despite their widespread use, existing topical therapies all possess substantial shortcomings:
•Topical steroids pose a particular concern in pediatric patients due to the risk of systemic absorption, and the consequent risk of HPA axis suppression, and potential developmental problems. Chronic use of topical steroids in atopic dermatitis patients is generally avoided. Many physicians are also reluctant to use steroids to treat atopic dermatitis on the face due to the increased risk of glaucoma and cataracts, or the diaper/groin region due to risk of skin thinning. There is also considerable concern among many parents about treating their children with steroids.
•Topical calcineurin inhibitors are generally seen as providing less symptomatic improvement than topical steroids and are also associated with some application site burning. In 2005 the FDA placed a boxed warning on the labels of both TCIs regarding a potential increased risk of cancers, especially lymphomas, associated with their use, which often creates significant parental resistance to their use.
•Eucrisa is a topical non-steroidal PDE4 inhibitor approved by the FDA in 2016. Despite initial interest among the physician community to adopt the product, its growth has been hampered by modest symptomatic improvement, frequent occurrences of application site burning and stinging, and disadvantaged reimbursement status compared to other atopic dermatitis treatments.
•Opzelura is a topical JAK inhibitor approved in September 2021 for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. The label carries an extensive boxed warning for serious infections, all-cause mortality, malignancy, major adverse cardiovascular events and thrombosis, and the product is limited to short-term, non-continuous use after failure of other treatments.
Treatment with biologics like Dupixent remains highly restricted. In the United States, less than 2% of all atopic dermatitis patients are on biologic therapy. The uptake of biologics has remained limited due to multiple factors, including the fact that they are indicated only for use in moderate-to-severe patients, their high cost and patient co-payments, reimbursement and access restrictions, and patient fear of injection.

Roflumilast Cream Clinical Development
Plaque Psoriasis
    We have successfully completed the pivotal clinical studies of roflumilast cream in plaque psoriasis, and submitted an NDA to the FDA. The FDA has set a PDUFA action date of July 29, 2022. Our NDA submission is supported by the positive data from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies, DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2, and our long-term Phase 2b open label study. In all trials, roflumilast cream was generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.
Key Completed Trials
ARQ-151-301 and 302 (DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2 pivotal Phase 3 studies)
The DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2 studies were identical pivotal Phase 3 randomized, parallel, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-national, multi-center studies in which subjects age 2 years and above with mild, moderate, or severe chronic plaque psoriasis involving between 2% and 20% body surface area received 8 weeks of (i) roflumilast cream 0.3% once daily or (ii) matching vehicle once daily. DERMIS-1 enrolled 439 subjects and DERMIS-2 enrolled 442 subjects.
Results from the eight-week treatment period demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to the matching vehicle on key efficacy endpoints. On the studies’ primary efficacy endpoint of percentage of subjects achieving Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) success, which was defined as a score of “clear” or “almost clear” plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline at week 8, 42.4% of subjects treated with roflumilast cream achieved IGA Success, compared to 6.1% of subjects treated with vehicle (p < 0.0001) in DERMIS-1, and 37.5% of subjects treated with roflumilast cream achieved IGA Success, compared to 6.9% of subjects treated with vehicle (p<0.0001) in DERMIS-2. Roflumilast cream also demonstrated statistically significant improvements over vehicle on key secondary endpoints, including on Intertriginous IGA Success, Psoriasis Area Severity Index-75, reductions in itch as measured by the Worst Itch-Numerical Rating Scale, and patient perceptions of symptoms as measured by the Psoriasis Symptoms Diary (PSD). 
Roflumilast cream was well-tolerated by the patient populations, with rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) low and similar to vehicle, with most TEAEs assessed as mild to moderate in severity. Of the subjects treated with roflumilast cream, five subjects (1.7% of subjects) in DERMIS-1 and one subject (0.3% of subjects) in DERMIS-2 discontinued the study due to a TEAE. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. 
ARQ-151-202 (Long-Term Safety Study)
The long-term safety study was a Phase 2, multi-center, open label study of the long-term safety and efficacy of roflumilast cream 0.3% in adult subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis involving up to 25% total body surface area (BSA), evaluated in two cohorts: subjects who completed the ARQ-151-201 Phase 2b, randomized, controlled trial; and previously untreated subjects. All subjects applied roflumilast cream 0.3% once daily for 52 weeks at home. Approximately half (164 out of 332) of the subjects entered this long-term study after completing treatment with roflumilast cream 0.3% or 0.15% in the randomized Phase 2b study (ARQ-151-201) and therefore received up to 64 weeks of total treatment with roflumilast cream (12 weeks in the randomized Phase 2b study and 52 weeks in the long-term safety study). Periodic clinic visits included assessments for clinical safety, application site reactions, and disease improvement or progression. The primary outcome measures of this long-term safety study were the occurrence of TEAEs and the occurrence of serious adverse events.
Index to Financial Statements

In this open label study, roflumilast cream 0.3% applied once daily for up to 52 weeks demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability over the long-term treatment period, consistent with what was seen in the randomized Phase 2b study, with only 3.6% of subjects experiencing a treatment-related adverse event during 52 weeks of treatment. Additionally, a durable treatment effect was maintained through 52 to 64 weeks. At week 52 of the long-term safety study, 44.8% of all subjects attained an IGA Success of clear or almost clear, with 34.8% of subjects in Cohort 1 and 39.5% of subjects in Cohort 2 achieving IGA Success, defined as a score of clear or almost clear plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline. Additionally, of the subjects in the 12-week randomized Phase 2b study who were treated with roflumilast cream 0.3%, and who attained an IGA of clear or almost clear at 12 weeks in the first study, then continued on treatment in the long-term safety study, 66.7% had an IGA of clear or almost clear at the end of 64 weeks of treatment or their last visit. Of the 332 subjects in this study, 73.5% completed the full 52 weeks of open label treatment, with only 3.9% of subjects discontinuing the study due to an adverse event and less than 1% of subjects discontinuing due to lack of efficacy. There were no treatment related serious adverse events reported.
Atopic Dermatitis
Key Completed Trials
ARQ-151-212
The most recent study completed with roflumilast cream in atopic dermatitis was a multi-center, double-blind, vehicle-controlled proof of concept Phase 2 study, in which 136 adolescents (ages 12 and above) and adults with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis involving between 1.5% and 35% BSA were randomized across three arms to receive once daily topical applications for 4 weeks of: (1) roflumilast cream 0.15%, or (2) roflumilast cream 0.05%, or (3) vehicle. The goals of this small proof of concept study were to establish whether roflumilast cream provides a signal of potential symptomatic improvement in atopic dermatitis subjects, as well as to gain an understanding of its tolerability. Completion rates for the study were 98% in the roflumilast cream 0.15% arm, 91% in the roflumilast cream 0.05% arm, and 93% in the vehicle arm.
On the study's primary endpoint, the absolute change from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Total Score after 4 weeks of once daily treatment, neither dose reached statistical significance versus vehicle, although roflumilast cream 0.15% showed a trend towards significance, with a mean improvement of 6.4 in subjects treated with roflumilast cream 0.15% compared to 4.8 in subjects treated with vehicle (p = 0.097). On the secondary endpoint of mean percent change from baseline on EASI, roflumilast cream 0.15% demonstrated a statistically significant improvement versus vehicle (72.3% versus 55.8%, p = 0.049). Efficacy was also observed at both doses as measured by EASI-75 (roflumilast cream 0.05%: 59.1% versus vehicle: 31.1%, p = 0.009 and roflumilast cream 0.15%: 52.3% versus vehicle: 31.1%, p = 0.045). On the Validated Investigator Global Assessment - Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD), roflumilast cream 0.15% also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement versus vehicle in the percentage of subjects achieving clear or almost clear (roflumilast cream 0.15%: 52.3% versus vehicle: 31.1%, p = 0.040). 
In this study, both doses of roflumilast cream were well-tolerated. 95% of subjects on active treatment completed the full study. The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs and application site reactions were low (< 5%) and similar between active treatment and vehicle. All TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. Among subjects receiving roflumilast cream, there was only one serious adverse event (SAE), which was unrelated to treatment, and only one discontinuation due to a TEAE.
We believe the consistent evidence of improvement in atopic dermatitis signs and symptoms demonstrated by both strengths of roflumilast cream across multiple endpoints, as well as the magnitude of improvement demonstrated on both doses in this small proof-of-concept study, demonstrate the ability of roflumilast cream to effectively treat atopic dermatitis. Additionally, this study provided valuable insights into the safety and tolerability of roflumilast cream in this population, an especially important consideration because the majority of atopic dermatitis sufferers are young children. While the study did not reach statistical significance on every endpoint, the consistency of evidence for improvement in atopic dermatitis, coupled with favorable tolerability data, provides us with the confidence to continue the development of roflumilast cream in atopic dermatitis.

Key Ongoing Trials
The atopic dermatitis Phase 3 program includes four studies. INTEGUMENT-1 and -2 are multi-center, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies, in approximately 650 subjects in each study, ages 6 and above with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. Subjects have been randomized to receive once daily topical applications for 4 weeks of roflumilast cream 0.15%, or vehicle. The primary endpoint is the proportion of all randomized subjects who attain IGA Success, defined as a vIGA-AD score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ plus a 2-grade improvement from Baseline at week 4. Sharing a similar overall design, INTEGUMENT-PED is a multi-center, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 study in approximately 650 subjects ages 2-5 with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. Subjects have been randomized to receive once daily topical application for 4 weeks of roflumilast cream 0.05%, or vehicle and the primary endpoint is also the proportion of all randomized subjects who attain IGA Success at week 4. INTEGUMENT-OLE is an open label extension study that is enrolling up to 1,500 subjects who have completed INTEGUMENT-1, -2, or -PED. Subjects are to be treated for up to 52 weeks and the primary endpoints are the occurrence of TEAEs and SAEs. We expect to provide topline data from each of INTEGUMENT-1 and -2 by the end of 2022, and from INTEGUMENT-PED in 2023.
Roflumilast Foam (ARQ-154)
We are also developing a foam formulation of topical roflumilast for the treatment of scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. Roflumilast foam contains the same highly potent and selective PDE4 inhibitor in roflumilast cream, and is nearly identical to roflumilast cream, with all ingredients in the foam being the same as those in the cream, other than reduced oil content and the addition of a propellant in the can to create the foam. Roflumilast foam is a light foam, similar to hair mousse, that has been designed to deliver the drug to the scalp while not leaving a greasy residue or disturbing hair style. The foam breaks easily upon agitation, creating a thin solution that can be rubbed easily into the scalp. Additionally, the product does not melt on the fingers prior to application. Roflumilast foam will not stain clothing or bedding, and does not have an unpleasant smell. Roflumilast foam is designed for simple once-a-day application and neither burns nor stings on application. 
We have successfully completed Phase 2 studies of roflumilast foam in seborrheic dermatitis and scalp and body psoriasis, demonstrating promising efficacy and tolerability in both diseases, and are currently conducting pivotal Phase 3 studies in both indications. We believe that roflumilast foam may offer physicians and patients a highly differentiated clinical profile that is ideally suited to address unmet needs in the topical treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and scalp psoriasis.
Seborrheic Dermatitis
Seborrheic Dermatitis Background
Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin disease that is estimated to occur in more than 10 million people in the United States. The disease causes red patches covered with large, greasy, flaking yellow-gray scales, and is frequently itchy. It appears most often on the scalp, face (especially on the nose, eyebrows, ears, and eyelids), upper chest, and back as depicted in the figure below. A milder variant of the disease is dandruff. While the pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis is not well understood, some experts believe a contributor is an over-abundance of Malassezia, a naturally occurring yeast found on normal skin but found in excess numbers on skin with seborrheic dermatitis. There also is an immunological or inflammatory component, possibly as a result of the proliferation of the Malassezia yeast and its elaboration of substances that irritate the skin. Seborrheic dermatitis can occur in both adults and infants, and in infants is commonly referred to as “cradle cap”.

Current Seborrheic Dermatitis Treatment Landscape
There are a number of widely used treatments for seborrheic dermatitis, including antifungal agents, lower potency steroids, and immunomodulators.
•Antifungal agents, particularly azoles such as ketoconazole, are the cornerstone of therapy for seborrheic dermatitis. These agents are available in a variety of topical formulations, and oral antifungals are occasionally used in very severe cases. Antifungals in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis are generally well-tolerated, although some patients experience irritant contact dermatitis, a burning or itching sensation, or dryness.
•Topical steroids, mostly low- to mid-potency, are often prescribed for patients suffering from seborrheic dermatitis because of the inflammatory component of the disease. Due to the risks associated with steroid use, particularly on the face, physicians try to limit duration or avoid steroid therapy. 
•TCIs are also sometimes used off-label for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. These agents appear to provide symptomatic improvement in seborrheic dermatitis due to their anti-inflammatory effects. As previously noted, TCIs carry a boxed warning for the potential increased risk of cancers, especially lymphomas, associated with their use, and physicians generally try to avoid long-term use in patients suffering from seborrheic dermatitis. Additionally, TCIs only provide symptomatic improvement in seborrheic dermatitis in areas of skin that are very thin and where the drug can penetrate (i.e., largely the periocular areas only).
While physicians have a number of relatively inexpensive treatment options that provide symptomatic improvement for seborrheic dermatitis, the greatest unmet need relates to inadequate response to existing therapies in some patients, particularly in patients with more severe disease. Physicians report that up to one-third of severe patients suffering from seborrheic dermatitis, and a smaller percentage of mild- and moderate-severity patients, have an inadequate response to current seborrheic dermatitis treatments. Additionally, physicians are wary of using steroids on the face due to the risk of skin thinning, spider veins, folliculitis, and unnatural hair growth. Physicians are especially wary of using steroids near the eyes due to the potential increased risk of cataracts and glaucoma. Finally, many physicians are reluctant to treat chronically with steroids and TCIs, the main anti-inflammatory agents used in treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. 
We believe roflumilast foam may present a unique dual mechanism of action to treat patients with seborrheic dermatitis. Based on clinical data to date across indications, topical roflumilast has demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, a recent nonclinical study demonstrated that roflumilast foam may also possess anti-fungal effects, specifically against Malassezia, the fungus implicated in seborrheic dermatitis. Because the pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis potentially includes both a fungal overgrowth component and an inflammatory component, roflumilast foam’s putative dual mechanism of action may provide symptomatic improvement for patients not achieving suitable responses from currently available therapies. In addition to the opportunity in treatment resistant patients, we believe roflumilast foam may be an option for some patients as a first-line therapy, especially patients with involvement of the face where other therapies are contraindicated.
Scalp Psoriasis
Scalp Psoriasis Background
Scalp psoriasis is a manifestation of plaque psoriasis that occurs in nearly half of all psoriasis patients, characterized by plaques in the hair-bearing area of the scalp and sometimes extending to the forehead, back of the neck, or behind or inside the ears as depicted in the figures below. These psoriatic plaques are identical to plaques on other body areas, however topical treatment of these plaques is complicated by the difficulty of delivering topical drugs under hair-bearing areas. As with psoriatic plaques on other parts of the body, psoriasis on the scalp is often itchy and is sometimes painful. Scalp psoriasis can also be associated with hair loss, likely due to damage to the hair from excessive scratching, rubbing, or combing of the affected area.

Current Scalp Psoriasis Treatment Landscape
Scalp psoriasis treatments are similar to plaque psoriasis treatments, given that the plaques are identical to the plaques in other body areas. Topical treatments for scalp psoriasis include TCS, vitamin D analogs, or the combination, in a topical formulation suitable for hair-bearing areas, such as shampoos, solutions, or foams. However, many of the current topical formulations for hair-bearing areas are poorly formulated and are not well-received by patients. Existing topical treatments for the scalp also suffer from the same efficacy, safety, tolerability, and patient acceptability issues as existing creams and ointments. While both biologics and systemic treatments will improve scalp psoriasis, they suffer from the same limitations on their use as in plaque psoriasis. 
Roflumilast Foam Clinical Development
We have successfully completed Phase 2 studies of roflumilast foam in seborrheic dermatitis and scalp psoriasis. In seborrheic dermatitis, we initiated a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, with topline data anticipated in mid-year 2022. We also initiated a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in scalp and body psoriasis, with topline data anticipated in the second half of 2022. If these pivotal Phase 3 trials for roflumilast foam are positive, we expect the data to be sufficient basis for an NDA submission to the FDA for each indication.
Seborrheic Dermatitis
Key Completed Trials 
ARQ-154-203 (Phase 2 Study)
Study ARQ-154-203 enrolled 226 adult subjects with moderate-to-severe seborrheic dermatitis. This 8-week, multi-center, multi-national, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of roflumilast foam 0.3% administered once daily to affected areas on the scalp, face, and body. 
Roflumilast foam 0.3% administered once daily for 8 weeks demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to a matching vehicle foam on key efficacy endpoints in subjects with moderate-to-severe seborrheic dermatitis. On the study’s primary endpoint assessed at week 8, roflumilast foam 0.3% achieved an IGA Success rate of 73.8% compared to a vehicle rate of 40.9% (p<0.0001). IGA Success is defined as the achievement of an IGA score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ on a 5-grade scale plus at least a two-point change from baseline. The onset of effect was rapid, with roflumilast foam statistically separating from vehicle as early as week 2, the first visit after baseline, on IGA Success as well as multiple secondary endpoints. For example, at week 8, 64.6% of subjects treated with roflumilast foam who had a baseline WI-NRS score of 4 achieved an itch reduction of at least 4 points compared to 34.0% of vehicle treated subjects (p=0.0007). Other secondary endpoints included overall assessment of erythema and overall assessment of scaling, which also had positive outcomes. 
Importantly, roflumilast foam was well-tolerated, with rates of application site adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, and discontinuations due to adverse events low and similar to vehicle. Only 2 out of 154 subjects (1.3%) treated with roflumilast foam discontinued the study due to an adverse event, compared to 1 out of 72 subjects (1.4%) treated with the vehicle.

Key Ongoing and Upcoming Trials 
ARQ-154-304 (Phase 3 Study)
The "STudy of Roflumilast foam Applied Topically for the redUction of seborrheic derMatitis" (STRATUM) is a Phase 3, parallel group, double blind, vehicle-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of roflumilast 0.3% foam administered once-daily in approximately 450 subjects ages nine and older with moderate to severe seborrheic dermatitis. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of subjects achieving IGA Success, defined as an IGA score of “clear” or “almost clear” plus a 2-point improvement at eight weeks.
ARQ-154-214 (Long-Term Safety)
Study ARQ-154-214 is an ongoing multi-center, open label Phase 2 long-term safety study of roflumilast foam 0.3% applied once daily in subjects with seborrheic dermatitis. This study includes subjects who were treated previously in the Phase 2 trial (ARQ-154-203), as well as subjects naive to treatment with roflumilast foam. Periodic clinic visits will include assessments for clinical safety, application site reactions, and disease improvement, or progression.
Scalp Psoriasis
Key Completed Trials
ARQ-154-204 (Phase 2b Study)
Study ARQ-154-204 was a multi-center, multi-national, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 2b study, in which 304 adolescents (ages 12 and above) and adults with scalp psoriasis covering at least 10% of the total scalp involvement and up to 25% of total psoriasis involvement in all body areas were randomized to receive 8 weeks of (1) roflumilast foam 0.3% once daily, or (2) matching vehicle once daily. Randomization was 2:1, active to vehicle. The primary endpoint of the trial was achievement of a Scalp IGA (S-IGA) scale score of “clear” or “almost clear” plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline, or S-IGA, at week 8. Multiple secondary endpoints were also evaluated.
Roflumilast foam demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared to a matching vehicle foam on key efficacy endpoints. On the study’s primary endpoint of S-IGA Success assessed at week 8, roflumilast foam 0.3% achieved a rate of 59.1% compared to a vehicle rate of 11.4% (p<0.0001). Onset was rapid, with significantly higher rates of S-IGA Success noted as early as 2 weeks.
Multiple secondary endpoints were also met. On the key secondary endpoint of Body Investigator Global Assessment (B-IGA) success assessed at week 8, roflumilast foam 0.3% achieved a rate of 40.3% compared to a vehicle rate of 6.8% (p<0.0001), with separation from vehicle on B-IGA Success as early as 2 weeks. Symptomatic improvement was also demonstrated, with 71.0% of subjects treated with roflumilast foam 0.3% who had a baseline Scalp Itch Numeric Rating Scale score of 4 or greater achieving an itch reduction of at least 4 points at week 8 compared to 18.5% of vehicle treated subjects (p<0.0001).
Consistent with other clinical trials of topical roflumilast, roflumilast foam was well-tolerated, as evidenced by subject-reported local tolerability and rates of application site adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, and discontinuations due to adverse events low and similar to vehicle. Only 5 out of 200 subjects (2.5%) in the roflumilast foam treated group discontinued the study due to an adverse event, compared to 2 out of 104 subjects (1.9%) treated with the vehicle.
Key Ongoing and Upcoming Trials 
ARQ-154-309 (Phase 3 Study)
The “A Randomized tRial Employing topiCal roflumilasT foam to treat scalp psORiasis” (ARRECTOR) study is a parallel group, double blind, vehicle-controlled pivotal Phase 3 study of the safety and efficacy of roflumilast 0.3% foam or a matching vehicle administered once-daily in approximately 420 subjects with scalp and body psoriasis ages 12 and older. The co-primary endpoints of the study include the proportion of subjects achieving S-IGA success and the proportion of subjects achieving B-IGA success, with IGA success defined as an IGA score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ plus a 2-point improvement from baseline after eight weeks.

ARQ-252
ARQ-252 is topical cream formulation of a potent and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of JAK1 that we are developing for chronic hand eczema and vitiligo. In a nonclinical study, ARQ-252 proved to be highly selective to JAK1 over JAK2. We believe that due to its high selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2, ARQ-252 has the potential to treat inflammatory diseases without causing the hematopoietic adverse effects associated with JAK2 inhibition. As the only JAK1-selective topical in development, we believe that ARQ-252 could offer a best-in-class topical JAK inhibitor, with a more favorable safety and tolerability profile than other topical JAK inhibitors due to its selectivity to JAK1 over JAK2, robust symptomatic improvement due to its high potency against JAK1, and a convenient and patient-friendly cream formulation.
In May 2021, we announced that the Phase 1/2b study of ARQ-252 in chronic hand eczema did not meet its primary endpoint, with further analyses of the study pointing to inadequate local drug delivery to the skin. Importantly, there were no safety or tolerability issues seen in that study. Given these analyses, we also elected to terminate the Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating ARQ-252 as a potential treatment in vitiligo, as we began reformulation efforts to develop an enhanced formulation of ARQ-252 that delivers more active drug to targets in the skin. Additionally, we have formulation and nonclinical efforts continuing for ARQ-255, an alternative deep-penetrating topical formulation of ARQ-252 designed to reach deeper into the skin in order to potentially treat alopecia areata. The ARQ-255 formulation is separate and distinct from ARQ-252, and thus there are no implications to ARQ-255 from ARQ-252.
In December 2019, we exercised our exclusive option under our Hengrui License Agreement to exclusively license the active pharmaceutical ingredient in ARQ-252 for all topical dermatological uses in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan. Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd. (Hengrui) is developing SHR-0302, the active ingredient in ARQ-252, for the oral treatment of various inflammatory and immunological disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis, and has completed a Phase 2b study in rheumatoid arthritis. Under our agreement, we have the right to reference their safety data, along with the systemic toxicology data supporting their program. Hengrui has built strong intellectual property protection around the active ingredient in ARQ-252, and holds U.S. composition of matter patents, including patents for the bisulfate form of the active ingredient that do not begin to expire until 2033. We believe there is the potential for additional intellectual property protection of ARQ-252 through possible future formulation and other patents.
Chronic Hand Eczema
Eczema is a term used to describe a group of different diseases that cause the skin to become red, itchy and inflamed. There are multiple forms of eczema, including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, hand eczema, dyshidrotic eczema, and seborrheic dermatitis. Eczema is very common, with some estimates that up to 30 million people in the United States may have some form of eczema.
Hand eczema is a common, predominantly inflammatory, skin disease characterized variously by redness, fluid filled blisters or bumps, scaling, cracking, itching and pain occurring on the hands, especially the palms (see figures below). It is the most common skin disease affecting the hands, with prevalence estimated at up to 2.5% of the population. The impact of hand eczema on patients can be significant, leading to work absences or disability, social stigmatization, and psychosocial distress.
Figures: Hand Eczema
Index to Financial Statements

Current Hand Eczema Treatment Landscape
Hand eczema is a difficult disease to treat. The palms of the hand have skin that can be up to ten times thicker than skin from other body areas, which inhibits drug absorption and the ability to deliver drugs topically. Hand eczema is typically treated with high potency topical steroids, mostly due to the aforementioned skin barrier challenges. In some cases, physicians also will incorporate barrier creams to aid in hydration and to prevent the irritant effect caused by occupational exposure, a common cause of hand eczema. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments specifically for the indication of hand eczema. However, LEO Pharma has demonstrated proof of concept for their topical JAK inhibitor, delgocitinib, in Phase 2 studies. Physicians report that a significant percentage of patients, including up to 40% of patients with severe dyshidrotic eczema (one type of hand eczema), have an inadequate response to currently available treatments. In those who respond to high potency topical steroids, skin atrophy becomes a problem with chronic use, even on the thick skin of the palms. 
Vitiligo
Vitiligo is a chronic and disfiguring autoimmune disease that causes the complete loss of skin color in blotches or patches, frequently in a symmetrical distribution, and has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. The disease is caused by the localized destruction by the immune system of melanocytes, the skin cells that produce the skin pigment melanin, resulting in complete depigmentation in the affected area. 
Vitiligo can have profound psychological impact on patients, particularly those with skin of color. Patients may feel loss of self-esteem and experience stigmatization. At this point in time, there are no FDA-approved treatments for vitiligo, so patients are often treated with off-label combinations of steroids, TCIs, ultraviolet light, and lasers. As such, there is great unmet need for therapies that are more effective and less limiting than currently available treatment modalities.
ARQ-252 Clinical Development
Chronic Hand Eczema
ARQ-252-205 Study (Phase 2b Study)
In May 2021, we announced that the Phase 1/2b study of ARQ-252 in chronic hand eczema did not meet its primary endpoint of IGA clear or almost clear at week 12, with further analyses of the study pointing to inadequate local drug delivery to the skin. Importantly, there were no safety or tolerability issues seen in that study. We are currently working on re-formulating ARQ-252 to develop an enhanced formulation that delivers more active drug to targets in the skin.
Vitiligo
ARQ-252-213 Study (Phase 2a Study)
Given the failure of the Phase 1/2b study of ARQ-252 in chronic hand eczema, and the data pointing towards inadequate drug delivery, we elected to terminate the Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating ARQ-252 as a potential treatment in vitiligo. We are currently working on re-formulating ARQ-252 to develop an enhanced formulation that delivers more active drug to targets in the skin.

ARQ-255
We are also developing ARQ-255, an alternative topical formulation of ARQ-252 designed to reach deeper into the skin in order to potentially treat alopecia areata. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to incorrectly attack the body’s own cells, specifically the hair follicles, leading to loss of hair—usually in patches—on the scalp, face or sometimes other areas of the body. While oral JAK inhibitors have shown symptomatic improvement in the treatment of alopecia areata, multiple topically applied JAK inhibitors have failed to demonstrate symptomatic improvement in alopecia areata. It is our belief that this discrepancy is due to the site of inflammation driving alopecia areata, deep in the skin at the base (bulb) of the hair follicle. While oral JAK inhibitor administration can achieve required levels of drug at the site of inflammation, conventional topical applications are unlikely to deliver concentrations of JAK inhibitors to the site of inflammation adequate to treat alopecia areata. We have undertaken a formulation effort we refer to as Deep Dermal Drug Delivery (“4D” technology), that leverages some of the unique physical properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in ARQ-255, and which we believe may allow us to topically deliver sufficient concentrations of the drug to potentially treat alopecia areata via topical administration. Formulation and nonclinical efforts are continuing for ARQ-255.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and is characterized by rapid and significant changes, intense competition and a bias towards proprietary products. We will face competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and generic drug companies. Any product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments, including those that may have achieved broad market acceptance, and any new treatment that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel therapies that offer more symptomatic improvement, have a lower risk of side effects, or are less costly than our current or future product candidates.
Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and commercialize a portfolio of product candidates that have a lower risk of side effects and/or provide more symptomatic improvement than competing products.
For psoriasis, our primary competitors include injected biologic therapies such as Humira, marketed by AbbVie Inc. and Eisai Co., Ltd., and Enbrel, marketed by Amgen Inc.; Pfizer Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited; non-injectable systemic therapies used to treat plaque psoriasis such as Otezla, marketed by Amgen Inc.; topical therapies such as branded and generic versions of clobetasol, such as Clobex, marketed by Galderma Laboratories, LP; generic versions of calcipotriene and the combination of betamethasone dipropionate/calcipotriene; and other treatments including various lasers and ultraviolet light-based therapies. In addition, there are several prescription product candidates under development that could potentially be used to treat psoriasis and compete with roflumilast cream, including tapinarof, under development by Dermavant Sciences, Inc. and deucravacitinib, an oral Tyrosine kinase type 2 (Tyk2) inhibitor under development by BMS, Inc.
For atopic dermatitis, our primary competitors include topical therapies such as Eucrisa, marketed by Pfizer Inc.; Opzelura, marketed by Incyte Corporation; which was approved in September 2021, and generic and branded versions of low to mid-potency steroids such as hydrocortisone and betamethasone. In the moderate-to-severe setting, the injected biologic therapy Dupixent, marketed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc; is approved, as well as the recently approved injectable biologic therapy Adbry, marketed by LEO Pharma. Non-injectable systemic therapies RINVOQ and CIBINQO were also recently approved in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. In addition, there are several prescription product candidates under development that could potentially be used to treat atopic dermatitis and compete with roflumilast cream, including but not limited to: topical tapinarof and topical cerdulatinib, both under development by Dermavant Sciences, Inc., topical delgocitinib, under development by LEO Pharma A/S and Japan Tobacco, Inc. (approved as Corectim in Japan), topical PF-06700841, topical difamilast ointment, under development by Medimetriks/Otsuka Pharma, oral PF-04965842, under development by Pfizer Inc., and injectable lebrikizumab, under development by Eli Lilly and Company.

For hand eczema, our primary competitors include topical therapies such as branded and generic versions of clobetasol, such as Clobex, and generic versions of betamethasone dipropionate. The only other prescription product candidate we are aware of under development for the treatment of hand eczema that would compete with ARQ-252 is delgocitinib, under development by LEO Pharma A/S, which showed proof of concept in a Phase 2B trial.
For vitiligo, our primary competitors include topical therapies such as generic and branded versions of calcineurin inhibitors, including Elidel, marketed by Bausch Health; branded and generic versions of high potency steroids, including Clobex, marketed by Galderma Laboratories, LP; and other treatments including various lasers and ultraviolet light-based therapies. In addition, there are several prescription product candidates under development that could potentially be used to treat vitiligo and compete with ARQ-252, including but not limited to: topical cerdulatinib, under development by Dermavant Sciences, Inc., Opzelura, under development by Incyte Corporation, and both oral PF-06651600 and oral PF-06700841, under development by Pfizer Inc.
For alopecia areata, our primary competitors include topical therapies such as branded and generic versions of high potency steroids, including Clobex, marketed by Galderma Laboratories, LP; intralesional corticosteroid injections such as branded and generic versions of triamcinolone, including Kenalog, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squib; and systemic immunosuppressants including generic versions of systemic steroids such as prednisone, branded and generic versions of cyclosporine, including Sandimmune, marketed by Sandoz, and branded systemic JAK inhibitors, including Xeljanz, marketed by Pfizer, Inc.. In addition, there are several prescription product candidates under development that could potentially be used to treat alopecia areata and compete with ARQ-255, including but not limited to: PF-6700841 and PF-06651600, under development by Pfizer, Inc., CTP-543, under development by Concert Pharmaceuticals, and baricitinib, under development by Eli Lilly and Company.
Commercial Operations
We intend to build our own commercial infrastructure in the United States and Canada to support the commercialization of our product candidates. We have begun to build commercial infrastructure given that regulatory approval of our first product candidate appears reasonably likely. We plan to build our own small specialty sales force to target dermatologists, with approximately 100 field-based staff. We may seek partnerships that allow us to target pediatricians and primary care physicians if required to maximize the potential of our product candidates. We have begun hiring the required sales, marketing, access and reimbursement, sales support, and distribution capabilities to prepare for commercialization. To develop the required commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest substantial financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that our product candidates will be approved, and we could invest resources and then later learn that a particular product candidate is not being approved. We may also seek other partners to help us access other geographic markets.
Intellectual Property
Maintaining proprietary rights in our product candidates and technologies will assist in achieving the success of our business. One way in which we obtain and maintain such proprietary rights is by filing patent applications and maintaining patents covering our core technologies and product candidates. Our policy is to file such patent applications in the United States and select foreign countries to better protect our worldwide interests. We also seek to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others. For this reason, we routinely monitor and evaluate third-party patents and publications, and, if necessary, take appropriate action based on that evaluation.
Patent term is based on the filing or grant date of the patent, as well as the governing law of the country in which the patent is obtained. In the United States, some pharmaceutical patents are also eligible for Patent Term Extension, or PTE, which can extend exclusivity for up to 5 additional years under certain conditions. The protection provided by a patent varies from country to country, and is dependent on the type of patent granted, the scope of the patent claims, and the legal remedies available in a given country.

We anticipate filing additional patent applications directed towards formulations, methods and other aspects of our technology relating to ARQ-252 and ARQ-255 which we may develop in the future.
Obtaining patent protection is not the only method that we employ to protect our propriety rights. We also utilize other forms of intellectual property protection, including trademark, and trade secrets, when those other forms are better suited to protect a particular aspect of our intellectual property. Our belief is that our propriety rights are strengthened by our comprehensive approach to intellectual property protection.
Maintaining the confidential nature of our non-publicly disclosed products and technologies is of paramount importance. For this reason, our employees, contractors, consultants and advisors are required to enter into nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements when their employment or engagement commences. Those individuals also enter into agreements that prohibit the communication or implementation of any third-party proprietary rights during the course of their employment with us. We also require any third-party that may receive our confidential information or materials to enter into confidentiality agreements prior to receipt of that information or material.

Exclusive License and Option Agreements
AstraZeneca
In July 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the AstraZeneca License Agreement, with AstraZeneca, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide exclusive license, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers, under certain AstraZeneca-controlled patent rights, know-how and regulatory documentation, to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, and otherwise exploit products containing roflumilast in topical forms, as well as delivery systems sold with or for the administration of roflumilast, or collectively, the AZ-Licensed Products, for all diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic uses for human dermatological indications, or the Dermatology Field. We intend to develop topical formulations of roflumilast for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, as well as other dermatological conditions. Under this agreement, we have sole responsibility for development, regulatory, and commercialization activities for the AZ-Licensed Products in the Dermatology Field, at our expense, and we shall use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain, and maintain regulatory approvals for, and commercialize the AZ-Licensed Products in the Dermatology Field in each of the United States, Italy, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, China, and Japan. Pursuant to the agreement, AstraZeneca provided us with certain quantities of roflumilast at a negotiated price for development purposes.
We paid AstraZeneca an upfront non-refundable cash payment of $1.0 million and issued 484,388 shares of our Series B convertible preferred stock, valued at $3.0 million on the date of the AstraZeneca License Agreement. We subsequently paid AstraZeneca the first milestone cash payment of $2.0 million upon the completion of a Phase 2b study of roflumilast cream in plaque psoriasis in August 2019 for the achievement of positive Phase 2 data for an AZ-Licensed Product. We have agreed to make additional cash payments to AstraZeneca of up to an aggregate of $12.5 million upon the achievement of specific regulatory approval milestones with respect to the AZ-Licensed Products, which includes $7.5 million upon FDA approval of our first product, and payments up to an additional aggregate amount of $15.0 million upon the achievement of certain aggregate worldwide net sales milestones. With respect to any AZ-Licensed Products we commercialize under the AstraZeneca License Agreement, we will pay AstraZeneca a low to high single-digit percentage royalty rate on our, our affiliates’, and our sublicensees’ net sales of such AZ-Licensed Products, until, as determined on a AZ-Licensed Product-by-AZ-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis, the later of the date of the expiration of the last-to-expire AstraZeneca-licensed patent right containing a valid claim in such country and ten years from the first commercial sale of such AZ-Licensed Product in such country.
Index to Financial Statements

The agreement continues in effect until the expiration of all royalty obligations as described above, unless earlier terminated: (1) by either party upon written notice for the other party’s material breach or insolvency event if such party fails to cure such breach or the insolvency event is not dismissed within specified time periods; (2) by AstraZeneca if we, our affiliates, or our sublicensees take actions to invalidate AstraZeneca-licensed patent rights, or if we permanently cease development of all AZ-Licensed Products, and an AZ-Licensed Product is not being commercialized by us; or (3) by us upon 120 days’ written notice or in the event of certain adverse clinical trial or other regulatory outcomes. In the event the agreement is terminated, except by us for AstraZeneca’s material breach or in the event of certain adverse clinical trial or other regulatory outcomes, we will be obligated to pay a termination fee in the amount of $5.0 million or 3% of net sales of AZ-Licensed Products for the 3-year period following the first regulatory approval of an AZ-Licensed Product, whichever is greater.
Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd
In January 2018, we entered into an exclusive option and license agreement, or the Hengrui License Agreement, with Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd, or Hengrui, whereby Hengrui granted us an exclusive option to obtain certain exclusive rights to research, develop, and commercialize products containing the compound designated by Hengrui as SHR0302, a JAK inhibitor, in topical formulations for the treatment of skin diseases, disorders, and conditions, or the Field, in the United States, Japan, and the EU (including for clarity the United Kingdom), or the Territory.
In December 2019, we exercised our exclusive option, and also contemporaneously amended the agreement to expand the territory to additionally include Canada, and therefore now have a license from Hengrui under certain patent rights and know-how controlled by Hengrui to research, develop and commercialize products containing SHR0302 in the Field in the Territory. Such license is sublicensable through multiple tiers, exclusive as to the patent rights licensed from Hengrui and nonexclusive with respect to the know-how licensed from Hengrui, and does not extend to patent rights for improvements to SHR0302 which Hengrui may come to control in the future unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. In addition, we have sole responsibility for development, regulatory, marketing and commercialization activities to be conducted for the licensed products in the Field and in the Territory, at our sole cost and discretion, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) develop at least one licensed product and to (2) commercialize the licensed products following regulatory approval thereof. Pursuant to the Hengrui License Agreement, a joint coordination committee reviews the progress of development and commercialization of each parties’ products containing SHR0302 in their respective territories and fields.
During the term of the Hengrui License Agreement, if we acquire or develop certain JAK inhibitor products that are not controlled by Hengrui, or Competing Products, we must negotiate in good faith with Hengrui whether to terminate the agreement or license to Hengrui the right to develop and commercialize such Competing Product in China. During the term of the Hengrui License Agreement, Hengrui will not develop or commercialize SHR0302 or any licensed product in the Field in the Territory. Additionally, if Hengrui decides to develop or commercialize a non-topical formulation of SHR0302 for the treatment of certain dermatologic indications in the Territory, we have the first right to negotiate a co-development and/or co-commercialization agreement with Hengrui for the same. We also have the right of first refusal if Hengrui decides to out-license a non-topical formulation of SHR0302 for the treatment of certain dermatologic indications in the Territory to a third-party during such period.
We made a $0.4 million upfront non-refundable cash payment to Hengrui upon execution of the Hengrui License Agreement option and license agreement. We also made a $1.5 million cash payment in connection with the exercise of our exclusive option. In addition, we have agreed to make cash payments of up to an aggregate of $20.5 million upon our achievement of specified clinical development and regulatory approval milestones with respect to the licensed products and cash payments of up to an additional $200.0 million in sales-based milestones based on achieving certain aggregate annual net sales volumes with respect to a licensed product. With respect to any products we commercialize under the agreement, we will pay tiered royalties to Hengrui on net sales of each licensed product by us, or our affiliates, or our sublicensees, ranging from mid single-digit to sub-teen percentage rates based on tiered annual net sales bands subject to specified reductions. We are obligated to pay royalties until the later of (1) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering such licensed product in such country and (2) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the relevant licensed product in the relevant country, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis. Additionally, we are obligated to pay Hengrui a specified percentage, ranging from the low-thirties to the sub-teens, of certain non-royalty sublicensing income we receive from sublicensees of our rights to the licensed products, such percentage decreasing as the development stage of the licensed products advance.
Index to Financial Statements

The agreement continues in effect until the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties as described above, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the following: (1) by either party upon written notice for the other party’s material breach or insolvency event if such party fails to cure such breach or the insolvency event is not dismissed within specified time periods; and (2) by us for convenience upon 90 days prior written notice to Hengrui and having discussed and consulted any potential cause or concern with Hengrui in good faith.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. We, along with any third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various nonclinical, clinical, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our products and product candidates. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirements and other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (GCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
Index to Financial Statements

Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and activity of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements, when applicable. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing, and control, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal studies evaluating reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct each clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined: 
•Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
•Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
Index to Financial Statements

In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval, and may be used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Concurrent with clinical trials, developers usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
FDA Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical studies in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing, and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee. Waivers of application user fees may be obtained in certain limited circumstances. 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for review, or “filed” by FDA, based on the FDA’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the additional information must be included in any resubmitted NDA, which is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the PDUFA guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the filing date to complete a standard review of an NDA for a drug that is a new molecular entity (NME), and of ten months from the date of NDA receipt to complete a standard review of an NDA for a drug that is not an NME. These review periods may be reduced from ten months to six months for an application designated for priority review.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines the facility is compliant with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may include limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, as a condition of approving an NDA, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the 
Index to Financial Statements

benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicine by managing its safe use, and can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and the labeling and prescribing information for the product may be changed based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
Changes to the conditions established in an approved NDA, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require a submission to the FDA in the form of an NDA supplement or as part of the NDA Annual Report. FDA approval prior to implementation is required for most major changes, and the FDA’s timeline for review varies according to the type of change being made. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data, and the FDA uses the same general procedures when reviewing such NDA efficacy supplements as it does in reviewing original NDAs.
Pediatric Information
The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) as amended, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required clinical assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of required pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. In addition, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six month extension of any exclusivity—patent or nonpatent—for a drug, if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new product candidates that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A Fast Track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Index to Financial Statements

Any marketing application for a drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a Fast Track designation and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For new-molecular-entity NDAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date.
Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies in a timely manner or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. There also are continuing, annual program fee requirements for any marketed products.
Index to Financial Statements

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
•safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warning, or other safety information about the product;
•fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension, or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.

The Hatch-Waxman Act
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. However, a drug must meet certain criteria relative to the Listed Drug to be eligible to use the Section 505(b)(2) pathway as opposed to the abbreviated NDA, or ANDA pathway, which is described below. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an ANDA. An ANDA generally provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include nonclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
Upon submission of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA, the applicant must certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor's decision to initiate patent litigation.

Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity
The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes a period of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products during which the FDA cannot accept for review an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA that relies on the branded reference drug. For example, the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, may obtain five years of exclusivity upon NDA approval of a drug containing a new chemical entity, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another applicant that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the condition of the new drug’s approval.
Five year and three year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full 505(b)(1) NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
Other Healthcare Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, and other healthcare laws and regulations.
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation.
In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA, as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.
Further, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined broadly to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse-midwives) and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. 
In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time-consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.

Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any new therapeutic product candidate. Sales in the United States will depend in part on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which reimbursement for therapeutic product candidates may be sought can be subject to challenge, reduction, or denial by payors.
The regulations that govern coverage, pricing, and reimbursement for new drugs and therapeutic biologics vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug or therapeutic biologic before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription biopharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, a drug company can obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of that product.
A drug company’s ability to commercialize any products successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Even if one or more products are successfully brought to the market, these products may not be considered cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for such products may be insufficient to allow them to be sold on a competitive basis. Increasingly, third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government and private insurance plans, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, and are seeking to reduce the prices charged or the amounts reimbursed for biopharmaceutical products.
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Significant delays can occur in obtaining reimbursement for newly-approved drugs or therapeutic biologics, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug or therapeutic biologic is approved by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug or therapeutic biologic will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers a drug company’s costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale, and distribution.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals, may need to be conducted. Third-party payors may not consider products to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable maintenance of price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on a drug company’s investment in drug development.
Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also be insufficient to cover a drug company’s costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may be based on payments allowed for lower cost drugs or therapeutic biologics that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other services, and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for drugs or therapeutic biologics may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs or therapeutic biologics from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.

U.S. Healthcare Reform
In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted, which was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional health policy reforms. The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, (i) subjected therapeutic biologics to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars by creating a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products, (ii) established a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs and therapeutic biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, (iii) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, (iv) established annual nondeductible fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and therapeutic biologics, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, (v) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs and therapeutic biologics to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs and therapeutic biologics to be covered under Medicare Part D, which has since been increased to 70%, (vi) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, (vii) expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program, (viii) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research, and (ix) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021. The executive order instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures. U.S. federal government agencies also currently face potentially significant spending reductions, which may further impact healthcare expenditures. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Moreover, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health, to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market, and sell any products we may develop.

Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Although a number of these, and other potential, proposals will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, the probability of success of these and any other Trump administration reform initiatives is uncertain, particularly in light of the new Biden administration. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We anticipate that these new laws will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, health reform initiatives may arise in the future, particularly as a result of the 2020 presidential election.
Human Capital Resources and Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 147 full-time employees. Of these full-time employees, 25 have an M.D., a Ph.D. or a Pharm. D and 3 have been Nurse Practitioners or Physician Assistants. From time to time, we also retain independent contractors to support our organization. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
The pharmaceutical development business is fundamentally a people-centric, knowledge-based business. Additionally, one core element of our corporate strategy is to build an industry-leading team of dermatology experts. As such, we expend considerable management time and attention, and financial resources, to attracting, retaining, and motivating exceptional individuals at our company. These efforts include not only our recruitment and compensation programs, but equally importantly, include the corporate culture that we have built at the company, and the management practices we employ in order to obtain the best possible performance from our team.
