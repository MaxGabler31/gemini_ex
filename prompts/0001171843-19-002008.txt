Forward-Looking Statements
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
Overview
 
STR Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) commenced operations in 1944 as a plastics and industrial materials research and development company. Based upon our expertise in polymer science, we evolved into a global provider of encapsulants to the solar industry. Our pioneering background in plastics also served as the foundation for a number of other plastics products we have manufactured over the years and led to our recent entrance into the high-end food packaging business.
Recent Developments
 
Liquidity Needs. We continue to incur substantial losses. We incurred net losses of $5.8 million and $5.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was $5.6 million of cash. In addition, our credit facilities are limited to our factoring arrangement in Spain and a €2.0 million economic development loan received in March 2019 from the regional government of Asturias, Spain. Unless and until our operating results improve, we do not expect that we will be able to obtain traditional bank debt or other financing. Furthermore, tight credit in the solar manufacturing industry may delay or prevent our customers from securing funding adequate to operate their businesses and purchase our products and could lead to an increase in our bad debt levels. We have recently entered into an agreement for the sale of our Johor, Malaysia facility for RM22.5 million (approximately $5.3 million, after realtor fees, as of December 31, 2018). The sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including the timely approval of the sale by the Johor Port Authority, and we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain the requisite approvals or that the sale will take place on a timely basis, if at all. If we do not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or obtain alternative or additional sources of capital to fund operations, we will not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash needs. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to timely complete our sale of our Malaysia facility, or in executing on our strategic plans described in further detail herein, our liquidity and capital resources will be adversely affected and we may wind down or cease any or all of our operations. Any wind down or dissolution may be a lengthy, complex and costly process and, in such event, there can be no assurance that there will be any funds available for distribution to stockholders.
India Tolling Plan. At the beginning of 2017, our manufacturing operations in Asia were based in China. A review of our production in China revealed that our sales volume was shifting to customers in India. As a result, we decided to wind down our manufacturing operations in China in 2017 and entered into an agreement with a tolling partner in India. By the close of 2017, we effectively completed the wind down process in China, with only a small administrative team remaining in an office under a short-term lease, and commenced tolling operations in India. We sold our undamaged production line from STR China to this tolling partner, and in 2018 we sold an additional production line to our tolling partner to further increase its manufacturing capacity in India. The line became operational at the end of the third quarter of 2018.
 
We continue to reorganize our business to better align with customer geography, to reduce the cash burn related to unprofitable locations, to convert assets to cash for potential redeployment into more profitable endeavors and possible business opportunities and to evaluate other strategic alternatives. We cannot assure that any of these efforts will be successful.
 
High-End Food Packaging. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated a significant investment through our wholly-owned subsidiary in Spain to enter the high-end food packaging business. This investment, which leverages our plastics expertise, includes the purchase of new, state-of-the-art plastics processing equipment and related building improvements along with the addition of experienced staff to pursue manufacturing and sales of high-end food packaging products. This project was supported in part by insurance proceeds we received for damage to our plastic manufacturing equipment that occurred in our China manufacturing facility in 2017. These insurance proceeds were available to the Company only if we invested in new plastics manufacturing equipment. We were advised by our insurer that our investment qualified for reimbursement under the terms of our policy and have received from them payments totaling approximately $2.6 million. Of this reimbursement, $0.8 million was received in October 2017 and $1.8 million was received during 2018. To further support this project, in March 2019, we obtained a €2.0 million loan from the Regional Promotion Society (“SRP”), an agency of the government of Asturias, Spain. By the close of 2018, we had substantially completed the necessary renovations to one of our buildings in Asturias, Spain, including the construction of a tower required to accommodate our new equipment, as well as the installation and interconnection of a new, state-of-the-art multi-layer blown film extrusion line. We expect this facility and equipment to allow us to begin to manufacture competitive barrier film structures for the food packaging industry in the second quarter of 2019. As of the date of this report, the new line has been installed and placed into operation, and initial trials of fully formulated, multi-layer barrier films have been completed. The food packaging business is highly competitive having market participants with substantially more resources and experience than us. We will be a new entrant in this market and we cannot assure that we will be successful in this new endeavor.

Manufacturing Facility Fire Insurance Recoveries. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a $0.9 million loss on disposal of fixed assets attributable to a fire in our manufacturing facility in China. During 2017, STR China received interim payments totaling RMB12.7 million (approximately $1.9 million based upon 2017 currency conversion rates) from our local China insurance carrier related to the existing fire insurance claim. During 2017, we also received $0.8 million in the U.S. under the master property insurance plan related to the same claim. Our U.S. entity received an additional $1.8 million reimbursement during 2018 as we had continued to make qualifying capital investments under the packaging project. These payments complete the final settlement.
Equipment Purchase Agreement and Technology License Agreement. On January 16, 2018, we entered into an equipment purchase agreement and a technology license agreement (together, the “Agreements”) with a manufacturer of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules (the “Purchaser”).
 
Under the equipment purchase agreement, we agreed to purchase from a third party specialized equipment (the “Equipment”) for the production of one of our proprietary encapsulants (the “Encapsulant”), resell the Equipment to the Purchaser, install the Equipment at a facility of the Purchaser and train Purchaser personnel in the Equipment’s use. Under the technology license agreement, we granted the Purchaser the right to use the formula for the Encapsulant and certain of our production techniques to make or have made the Encapsulant for use in PV modules manufactured by the Purchaser. The license granted to the Purchaser pursuant to the technology license agreement is exclusive with respect to specified types of PV modules manufactured by the Purchaser, and nonexclusive as to all other types of PV modules. The Purchaser may also sublicense its rights under the technology license agreement to licensees of its PV module manufacturing processes.
 
Under the equipment purchase agreements, the Purchaser agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of $6.0 million. Billing and payment under the Agreements follows a schedule involving certain milestones relating to the qualification of the Encapsulant and installation, acceptance and operation of the Equipment. We received the initial payment of $1.8 million during the first quarter of 2018. For revenue recognition purposes under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (ASC 606), $1.8 million was recorded as revenue during the first quarter of 2018 as initial performance obligations were satisfied. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
The next milestone under the equipment purchase agreement, for which an additional $1.8 million would be due, is the completion of product qualification for the product being licensed. We have completed our testing of the product. However, the Purchaser is in default of its obligation under the equipment purchase agreement to diligently and in good faith pursue completion of the production qualification within 120 days of receipt of the product, and has entered into discussions with us to modify the Agreements. Such discussions include a proposal for the parties to enter into a more traditional customer relationship, whereby we would serve as an encapsulant manufacturer and supplier to the Purchaser. Such arrangement would also require successful completion of product qualification. We cannot assure that the parties will enter into an alternative arrangement, or that, if entered into, such alternative arrangement will be on terms favorable to us. We also cannot assure that we will be able to meet the Purchaser’s product qualification standards under the original or any modified arrangement. If we are not otherwise successful in negotiating an alternative arrangement, and the Purchaser does not complete its product qualification or otherwise fulfill its obligations under the Agreements, we intend to explore our legal remedies against the Purchaser. Due to the inherent uncertainties in pursing any such remedies, and the associated costs, expense and diversion of management time and resources, any ongoing dispute with the Purchaser could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.
 
2014 Transaction with Zhenfa
 
In 2014, we entered into certain definitive agreements with Zhenfa Energy Group Co., Ltd., a Chinese limited liability company (“Zhenfa”), and its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Zhen Fa New Energy (U.S.) Co., Ltd., a Nevada corporation (“Zhenfa U.S.”).

Purchase Agreement. 
 
On August 11, 2014, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Zhenfa U.S., pursuant to which Zhenfa U.S. acquired approximately 51% of our then outstanding shares of common stock on December 15, 2014 (the “Closing Date”).
 
Sales Service Agreement. 
 
In connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, Specialized Technology Resources, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a sales service agreement (the "Sales Service Agreement") with Zhenfa, whereby Zhenfa agreed, among other things, to assist us in a number of endeavors, including, without limitation, marketing and selling our products in China, acquiring local raw materials, hiring and training personnel in China, and complying with Chinese law. The Sales Service Agreement became effective on the date of Closing, for an initial term of two years, and automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated earlier. The Sales Service Agreement may also be terminated by either party at such time as Zhenfa and its affiliates own less than 10% of our outstanding common stock.
 
As we have substantially discontinued operations in China, Zhenfa is not currently providing us with any material services under this agreement. Any activities with Zhenfa under the Sales Service Agreement are subject to the oversight of our Special Committee of Continuing Directors.
 
Our Plastic Products
 
Solar Encapsulants. Drawing upon our considerable experience, we develop our solar encapsulant formulations internally and work in conjunction with our customers to meet their varying requirements. Our formulations offer a range of properties and processing attributes that align with the requirements of our customers’ lamination processes and module constructions. Our formulations can be used in both crystalline silicon and thin-film modules.
 
We manufacture our encapsulants using polymer sheet and film extrusion equipment to transform raw materials purchased in the form of pellets, powders and liquids to homogenized formulations made into rolls of sheet and film. We maintain expertise and facilities necessary to formulate and validate products using a variety of raw materials in order to achieve certain physical, chemical, mechanical, barrier, optical and electrical performance characteristics. We believe there is considerable synergy in our understanding of polymeric materials, formulating, testing and processing methods, as it applies to both solar encapsulants and multi-layer barrier films for packaging applications.
 
Multi-layer Barrier Film Packaging. We have developed and tested various formulations and physical structures of multi-layer films for high-end packaging applications, primarily for perishable foods such as meat, fish, cheese, yogurt, fruit, cereals, snack foods, etc. We expect our multi-layer film products for these applications to be competitive due to their chemical composition and physical structure. Our equipment has been specifically designed to make films that provide the required performance, such as oxygen and water vapor exclusion (barrier), printability, sealability, puncture resistance, clarity, anti-fog capability, etc., at a unit weight lower than many competing films commonly available in the market today. We have designed our products to offer high performance while reducing packaging waste and cost for our customers and end users. We believe our equipment is significantly more configurable than most competitive equipment currently serving the packaging market, and further believe that our competitive advantages as described herein will allow us to attract and retain customers that value locally produced, consistent, high-quality products at very competitive prices. The food packaging business is highly competitive, having market participants with substantially more resources and experience than us. We will be a new entrant in this market and we cannot assure that we will be successful in this new endeavor.
Our Markets and Customers
 
Our solar customers are module manufacturers located primarily in Asia, Europe and North America. We typically sell our encapsulants on a purchase order basis that specifies price and delivery parameters, but such orders can be cancelled or postponed prior to production. We also provide technical support and assist our customers when they are qualifying solar modules that utilize our products, which can take from two months to more than two years. Historically, our sales strategy has focused on developing long-term relationships with solar module manufacturers and working collaboratively during their product development efforts.
 
Over the past several years, many of our Western solar customers continued to lose market share to lower-cost Chinese module manufacturers, with many being forced into bankruptcy or exiting the solar business as module production migrated rapidly to Asia, primarily China. We established our own manufacturing plant in China and also engaged tolling manufacturers to augment our capacity there, but in light of the obstacles detailed herein relating to the Chinese market, we conducted an orderly wind down of our China-based manufacturing operations, which was effectively completed as of the end of 2017. Given that our China factory had been manufacturing encapsulants for sale outside of China, increasingly India, we decided to serve the market in India with production through a local tolling partner, Lucent CleanEnergy, in that country.

Lucent CleanEnergy accounted for approximately 32% of our net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Global Wedge, Inc. and Heckert Solar, each accounted for at least 10% of our net sales, and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 33% of our net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 62% and 49% of our net sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The accounts receivable from our top five customers represented 55% and 9% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
 
We expect to begin commercial sales of our packaging products in the second quarter of 2019 to customers primarily located on the Iberian Peninsula. Our prospective customers,with whom we have been developing relationships over the past year, are typically packaging manufacturers who will use our film as a component of a laminated product, such as a flexible foil lid or stand-up pouch, or a packager of perishable food who might use our film as a finished, protective outer layer, or a distributor who would provide our films for such applications to aggregated smaller users.
 
Our Operations
 
Facilities and Equipment
 
We currently operate a production facility in Llanera, Asturias, Spain. This production facility is augmented by our research, development and testing laboratory in Enfield, Connecticut, which is co-located with our corporate headquarters and our U.S. production facility. We have recently completed the installation of a new multi-layer barrier film packaging line in our Spain facility. This line has an approximate annual production capacity of 5,000 metric tonnes (mT).
 
We currently have total annual solar production capacity of approximately 2.6 GW at our Spain location, approximately 0.5 GW in Connecticut and approximately 1.0 GW in India with our tolling partner.
 
Certain of our production lines incorporate our proprietary technology and processes. We rely on third-party equipment manufacturers to produce manufacturing lines to our specifications, which we often further customize in-house. Most of our solar production lines are functionally equivalent, having the ability to manufacture all of our formulations and providing us with flexibility in meeting shifting trends in global demand.
 
On November 1, 2018, we received a non-binding letter of intent from a potential buyer for our Malaysia facility for RM22.5 million (approximately $5.3 million, after realtor fees, as of December 31, 2018) and subsequently entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with JB Cocoa Sdn BHD effective January 10, 2019. The agreement provides that the closing of the sale is subject to various customary and regulatory approvals and conditions, including the approval of the Johor Port Authority. The agreement further provides that if the conditions to the closing are not met and the closing does not occur within six months either party may terminate the agreement. The sale of the property is part of the Company’s focus to reduce its footprint and operating costs and convert underutilized assets to cash. We cannot assure that we will be able to obtain the required approvals and otherwise meet all the conditions to closing on a timely basis, if at all. Moreover, our expected net proceeds from the sale is based upon currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, and may be adversely affected in certain circumstances, including without limitation, if the value of the Malaysian ringgit decreases in relation to the U.S. dollar, or if we incur unanticipated expenses in connection with the sale.
 
Production Process
 
Our solar encapsulant production process typically begins by mixing EVA or POE pellets with several additives to give the encapsulant its desired properties. The mixture is then melted, homogenized, pressurized and forced through a die to create a “polymer curtain,” forming a continuous encapsulant sheet. The sheet then progresses downstream in a proprietary process and is ultimately slit to the desired width, wound into rolls and packaged for shipment to customers.
 
Our multi-layer barrier film packaging production process similarly entails mixing polymer pellets and additives to achieve the desired properties of the final structure. The mixture for each layer is melted, homogenized and pressurized in several extruders, then forced through a die wherein all layers are joined to create a “polymer bubble”, forming a continuous multi-layer film. The bubble progresses upward through a tower and is ultimately collapsed into a flat film, slit to width and wound into rolls.
 
Our manufacturing quality program is ISO 9001 certified. We have a high level of automation at each of our owned facilities that includes real-time computerized monitoring of the manufacturing process. Such automation provides consistency across our facilities so we can satisfy customer orders at all of our manufacturing locations. In addition, our enterprise resource planning system allows us to efficiently plan our production by location with global, real-time visibility.
 
5

 
We test our products as they are produced and at a high frequency after production. The Quality Department at all of our owned manufacturing facilities and our tolling partner follow our global quality assurance program and has a mandate to disposition products that do not meet required standards.
 
Raw Materials
 
Resin is the primary raw material used in our manufacturing processes, accounting for a significant portion of our manufacturing costs. A number of additives as well as roll-packaging materials represent the remainder of our raw material costs.
 
We have multiple vendors for resin. Our objective has been to carry at least a five-week supply of resin to provide protection against supply interruptions resulting from inclement weather, natural disasters and strikes. The stock is distributed among our production facilities and warehouses so that a disruptive event at one location would not affect our ability to continue production. We have qualified resin suppliers local to each of our manufacturing facilities and continue to pursue qualification of additional resin suppliers.
 
Seasonal Trends
 
Our business could be adversely affected by seasonal trends, holiday seasons and weather patterns. See Item 1A,-Risk Factors for more information.
 
Our Competition
 
We face intense competition in the solar encapsulant market and have experienced a significant decline in our global market share from approximately 30% in 2010 to less than 1% in 2018. We compete with a number of encapsulant manufacturers, including Bridgestone Corporation, Hangzhou First PV Material Co., Ltd., Mitsui Chemicals Group, Inc. and SK Chemical Ltd. We have also had to compete in the past with upstream plastic resin manufacturers moving into downstream markets. These resin manufacturers have included Dow Chemical Corporation, Dow Corning Corporation and E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Company (“DuPont”). We have also had to compete with other very large conglomerates such as 3M Company. Over the years, various alternative encapsulant materials have been used in solar modules, including POE, PVB and silicone. Many of our competitors are large, global companies with substantially more financial, manufacturing and logistical resources. Also, low-cost solar module manufacturers have emerged in Asia, primarily in China, who compete with our legacy customers in Western markets. As the China solar market matures, additional encapsulant providers from China and the greater Asian markets may compete with us.
 
Participants in the solar industry, including our customers, are experiencing intense pressure to reduce their costs. In order to remain competitive, we expect to be subject to continuing downward pricing pressures that may negatively impact our net sales and net earnings.
 
We compete in the solar industry on the basis of various factors, including:
 

• | price;
--+-------


• | product performance, including quality and technology;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | product innovations;
--+---------------------


• | customer service and technical support; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | delivery timing and logistics.
--+-------------------------------

 
The food packaging business is highly competitive, having many market participants with substantially more resources and experience than us, including Asplan and Linpac in Spain. We will be a new entrant in this market with no established customer base. Our success will be based upon our ability to successfully develop new customer relationships with customers that often will have established relationships with other competing vendors. We believe that establishing these relationships will require us to develop and offer high quality products at an attractive price, and be able to timely meet customer qualification requirements, including for fitness-for-use testing and an analysis of food preservation performance in controlled environments. Moreover, we have limited experience in manufacturing and formulating products for the packaging market, and the equipment we purchased to manufacture our packaging products is highly complex. We may therefore, experience unanticipated delays and expenses in connection with our entry into this market. We cannot assure that we will be successful in this new endeavor.

Qualification and Certification
 
Design certification programs for solar modules measure performance under simulated or advanced environmental conditions. In certifying their solar modules, our customers must qualify the encapsulant utilized within their product. The certification and qualification tests related to solar modules are defined in the following standards: IEC 61215 (crystalline silicon), IEC 61646 (thin-film) and UL 1703.
 
A successful qualification test program typically means that the tested models/types of solar modules have been subjected to and have passed the minimum requirements of the relevant standards. In addition, many PV module manufacturers often use internal validation tests that are beyond the scope and requirements of IEC and UL. These tests require suppliers to spend more time and investment to become approved suppliers for the module manufacturer’s bill of materials. Qualification or certification does not guarantee any performance, but is designed to provide reasonable assurance that the solar modules of the tested model or type will perform reliably under field conditions.
 
Under guidelines developed by the IEC/TC82/WG2 committee in 2000, modifications to the encapsulation system for solar modules can require retesting of the solar module. Such guidelines call for various retesting if there is any change in the chemistry of the encapsulant used in the solar module.
 
In our food packaging business, some customers require either certification or progress toward certification and adherence to standards of the British Retail Consortium (“BRC”) Global Standard for Food Safety. Certain of these standards require a period of commercial operation during which our procedures are monitored for compliance. We have prepared for and met the requirements for startup and initial production and expect to begin the production monitoring phase of certification, during which time it is permissible to manufacture and sell products to customers, beginning in the second quarter of 2019. Our packaging customers also have qualification requirements, typically accomplished at their premises, including fitness-for-use testing and an analysis of food preservation performance in controlled environments. We have performed some of these qualification tests in advance of our own production by manufacturing samples of our formulations and structures on equipment owned by our machinery vendor, and working with potential customers to make sure our products confirm their requirements, however, we have limited experience in manufacturing and formulating products for the packaging market, and the equipment we purchased to manufacture our packaging products is highly complex. We may, therefore, experience unanticipated delays and difficulties in accomplishing qualification testing and meeting customer requirements. We cannot assure that we will be successful in this new endeavor.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 63 people on a full or part-time basis. We maintain a non-unionized workforce, with the exception of some employees in our manufacturing facility in Spain, where unions are statutory. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages during the past five years.
Executive Officers
 
The following table sets forth the names and ages, as of March 1, 2018, of our executive officers. The descriptions below include each such person’s service as a board member or an executive officer of STR Holdings, Inc. and our predecessor.

Name | | Age | | Position
--------------------+----+-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------+---------
Robert S. Yorgensen | 55 | | Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer 
Thomas D. Vitro | 58 | | Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer

Robert S. Yorgensen. Mr. Yorgensen has been our Chairman since December 2014 and our President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of our board since January 2012. Prior to becoming our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Yorgensen was Vice President of STR Holdings, Inc., and President of our Solar Division since 2007, and has been employed with us for over 33 years. Mr. Yorgensen has held a variety of positions with us, including Extruded Products Manager and Senior Technical Specialist of Materials RD&E and Specialty Manufacturing, Technical Specialist of Materials RD&E and Specialty Manufacturing and Project Leader of Development Engineering and Specialty Manufacturing. He holds a Bachelor of Technology, Mechanical Engineering degree from the University of Connecticut and an A.S. from Hartford State Technical College.

Thomas D. Vitro. Mr. Vitro has been our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer since December 2015 and is responsible for all finance and accounting functions of the Company. Previously, Mr. Vitro served in various positions with us between 1982 and 2013, most recently as Vice President, Finance from 2009 to 2013. Prior to that, he was the Corporate Controller from 1988 to 2009. Mr. Vitro has a Bachelor of Science in Accountancy from Bentley University and is a Certified Management Accountant.
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property consists of multiple encapsulant and barrier film formulations, as well as several processes and sub-processes, and our trademarks “STR®”, “PhotoCap®” and “STR Protected®.” As appropriate, we require employees, suppliers and customers to execute confidentiality agreements.
 
We own a number of trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that relate to our products. We typically rely on trade secrets rather than patents to protect our proprietary manufacturing processes, proprietary formulations, methods, documentation and other technology, as well as certain other business information. Patent protection requires a costly and uncertain federal registration process that would place our confidential information in the public domain. While we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property rights, such confidentiality provisions related to our trade secrets could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets. Also, others may independently develop technologies or products that are similar or identical to ours. In such case, our trade secrets would not prevent third parties from competing with us. See Item 1A.-Risk Factors and Item 3,-Legal Proceedings.
 
We have granted a third party manufacturer of PV modules the right to use the formula for one of our encapsulant products and certain of our production techniques to make or have another party make the encapsulant for use in PV modules manufactured by the third party. The license is exclusive with respect to specified types of PV modules, and nonexclusive as to all other types of PV modules. The third party manufacturer may also sublicense its rights under the technology license agreement to licensees of its PV module manufacturing processes.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety and pollution-control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is not material and we do not believe the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be material. We use, generate and discharge hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes at some of our facilities in connection with our product development and manufacturing activities. Any failure by us to restrict adequately the discharge of such substances, chemicals or wastes could subject us to potentially significant liabilities, clean-up costs, monetary damages, fines or suspensions in our business operations. In addition, some of our facilities are located on properties with a history of use involving hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes and may be contaminated. For example, our 10 Water Street, Enfield, Connecticut location was found to contain a presence of volatile organic compounds, and we have removed contaminated soil to remediate these conditions. The estimated remaining cost we expect to pay to monitor the property is approximately $0.1 million. If we elect to sell, transfer or change the use of the facility, additional environmental testing would be required. We cannot assure that we will not discover further environmental contamination or that we would not be required to incur significant expenditures for environmental remediation in the future.
