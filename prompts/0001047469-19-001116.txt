        Hemisphere was incorporated in Delaware on January 16, 2013. Shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Class A common stock") are publicly traded under the symbol "HMTV" on the Nasdaq Global Market ("NASDAQ"). 
   Our Strategy 
         Our strategy is to provide unique programming focused on underserved but significant segments of the U.S. Hispanic population, allowing us to reach a deeper and broader U.S. Hispanic demographic than our competitors and to expand our presence in Latin America. Our objective is to maintain and improve our position as a leading U.S. Spanish-language media company by, among other things, (i) investing in content for our Networks to build viewership, (ii) growing affiliate revenues in Puerto Rico, the U.S. and Latin America, and (iii) driving advertising sales across our networks. Additionally, we continue to look for attractive opportunities to acquire assets that we consider to be undervalued or fairly valued with attractive financial or strategic characteristics. We intend to take a long-term view and primarily seek opportunities which will (i) expand our leadership position in the fast growing and highly desirable U.S. Hispanic pay-TV market, (ii) expand our portfolio within broadcast networks, and/or cable networks in Latin America and (iii) identify opportunities to create and/or distribute content to U.S. Hispanics and Latin Americans through OTT/SVOD platforms. We may also seek a variety of acquisition opportunities, including businesses where we believe an opportunity for value realization is already present, where we can realize synergies with our existing businesses, or that are in need of operational turnaround, which we believe would benefit from our experienced and cohesive management team with the proven ability to develop and grow acquired assets. At any given time, we may be in discussions relating to one or more acquisition opportunities. Additionally, we evaluate various digital strategies, from time to time. 
 Employees 
         At December 31, 2018, we and our subsidiaries employed 305 full-time persons. In the normal course of business, we use contract personnel to supplement our employee base to meet business needs. We or our subsidiaries may hire additional personnel in connection with the closing of future acquisitions. We believe that employee relations are generally satisfactory. Approximately 130 of our employees based in Puerto Rico are full-time unionized employees covered by two collective bargaining agreements (each, a "CBA" and collectively, the "CBAs"). Our main CBA expires on May 31, 2022 and covers all of our unionized employees except for four employees covered by the other CBA scheduled to expire on June 27, 2019. 
 Revenue Sources 
         We operate our business in one operating segment. Our two primary sources of revenue are advertising revenues and affiliate revenues. All of our networks generate both advertising revenues and affiliate revenues. Advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising time. Our advertising revenue tends to reflect seasonal patterns of our advertisers' demand, which is generally greatest during the fourth quarter of each year, driven by the holiday buying season. In addition, Puerto Rico's political election cycle occurs every four years and WAPA benefits from increased advertising sales in an election year. For example, in 2016, WAPA experienced higher advertising sales as a result of political 
 6

   advertising spending during the 2016 governmental elections. The next election in Puerto Rico will occur in 2020. 
         Affiliate revenues are earned from Distributors of our television networks, including cable, satellite and telecommunication service providers. Our television networks are distributed pursuant to multi-year agreements that generally provide for monthly affiliate revenues with annual rate increases and have terms of varying length. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenue earned under affiliation agreements with DISH Network, LLC and AT&T Inc. (as successor to DirecTV following the completion of their merger) each accounted for more than 10% of our total net revenues. We recognize affiliate revenues when they are accrued pursuant to the agreements we have entered into with respect to such revenue. We set forth our net revenue, total assets and operating income in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
         We generate approximately 93% of our net revenues from the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we generated $136.2 million and $114.2 million, respectively, from the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we generated $10.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively, from outside the United States. 
   OUR NETWORKS AND JOINT VENTURES 
   WAPA 
         Headquartered in San Juan, Puerto Rico, WAPA is a full-power independent broadcast television network. WAPA was founded in 1954 as the second broadcast television network in the Caribbean and the third in Latin America. WAPA occupies a prime channel position (channel 4) together with its full power repeater stations, WTIN in Ponce and WNJX in Mayagüez. WAPA is also distributed by all cable, satellite and telecommunication service providers in Puerto Rico. WAPA has been the #1-rated broadcast television network in Puerto Rico since the start of Nielsen audience measurement nine years ago. 
         WAPA owns a 66,500 square foot building housing its state-of-the-art production facilities, television studios, and administrative offices. All of WAPA's news and most of its local programs are produced at WAPA's production facility, which contains four television studios, including the largest television studio in the Caribbean, fully equipped control rooms, digital video, audio, editing, post-editing, and graphic production suites, and a scenery shop which produces all scenery and props for the local productions. WAPA also boasts one of the most technologically advanced news departments in Puerto Rico. 
         WAPA is Puerto Rico's news leader and the largest local producer of entertainment programming, producing nearly 60 hours in the aggregate each week. In addition to having Puerto Rico's most watched news programming, WAPA's top-rated local shows include Pégate al Mediodía (the #1-rated midday program). WAPA also licenses and televises blockbuster Hollywood movies and top-rated U.S. television series dubbed into Spanish. This diverse and unique mix of programming has made WAPA the market leader in Puerto Rico. 
         In 2009, WAPA launched WAPA Deportes in Puerto Rico through its over-the-air signal and carriage by all cable, satellite and telecommunications distributors in Puerto Rico. WAPA Deportes broadcasts various local and U.S. sports programming, including MLB, with exclusive television rights to the World Series and the All-Star Game,  NBA and Puerto Rico's professional men's basketball league, Baloncesto Superior Nacional. WAPA Deportes is the leading local sports network in Puerto Rico. 
         In 2008, WAPA launched WAPA.TV, which is now one of the most visited local sites in Puerto Rico. WAPA.TV provides up-to-the-minute news and weather, promotional clips of WAPA's most popular shows, additional video content not seen on WAPA, and a platform for viewers to share comments and interact, driving further audience engagement. In 2018, WAPA.TV's mobile-optimized website and apps generated a total of 176 million page views, 69 million visits and an average of 1.8 million monthly unique visitors.

        As a result of the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, Nielsen suspended survey operations in Puerto Rico effective September 7, 2017. Nielsen resumed operations in Puerto Rico on May 1, 2018. As such, all ratings results with respect to WAPA set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 are reported beginning May 1, 2018 (first available ratings date). 
   WAPA America 
         WAPA America, launched in 2004, is a Spanish-language cable television network targeting viewers from Puerto Rico, as well as the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Venezuela and Colombia (collectively referred to as "Caribbean Hispanics"), who reside in the U.S. Caribbean Hispanics are the second largest U.S. Hispanic population segment, representing 19% of the U.S. Hispanic population. WAPA America is distributed by all major U.S. cable, satellite and telecommunication operators to over 4.4 million subscribers, excluding digital basic subscribers. WAPA America televises the top-rated news and entertainment programming produced by WAPA. WAPA America supplements its programming with acquired telenovelas and cultural programming, popular sports programming from Puerto Rico and other programming from WAPA's library. 
         WAPA America is primarily distributed on Hispanic programming packages, which generally consist of 20 or more channels, such as Cinelatino, Pasiones, Centroamerica TV, Television Dominicana, CNN en Español, Discovery en Español, History en Español, ESPN Deportes and Fox Deportes (together, "Hispanic Programming Packages"). WAPA America is also distributed in more highly penetrated packages in the major markets of Orlando and Tampa. Hispanic pay-TV subscribers in the U.S. are expected to grow, driven by the continued long-term growth in Hispanic television households and by increased penetration of pay-TV among Hispanics. We expect to capitalize on this strong growth. For more information, see "Industry." 
   Cinelatino 
         Cinelatino is the leading Spanish-language cable movie network with more than 21 million subscribers across the U.S., Latin America and Canada. Cinelatino is programmed with a lineup featuring what we believe to be the best contemporary films and original television series from Mexico, Latin America and the U.S. Cinelatino was launched in Mexico in 1993, and introduced into the U.S. in 1995. 
         Our programming strategy for Cinelatino is specifically intended to provide the audience with the broadest selection of the most popular and highest-quality films across all popular genres, from Mexico and all other Latin American countries that have significant populations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Colombia and Venezuela. Consistent with its programming strategy, Cinelatino has licensed the rights to many of the highest grossing box office films in Mexico. Cinelatino has an expansive library of over 800 of the best Spanish-language titles from suppliers across the globe. Driven by the strength of its programming and distribution, Cinelatino is the #2-Nielsen rated Spanish-language cable television network in the U.S. overall based on coverage ratings. In July 2015, Cinelatino introduced advertising on its network. Additionally, leveraging its expansive content library, which includes theatrical films, made-for-television movies, series and other content acquired or licensed from third party suppliers, as well as its own original productions, Cinelatino licenses content to over-the-top services in the U.S. and Latin America. 
         Cinelatino has two feeds of its service, one that is distributed in the U.S. and a second that is distributed throughout Latin America and Canada. Cinelatino is distributed by all major U.S. cable, satellite and telecommunications operators on Hispanic Programming Packages and has over 4.6 million U.S. subscribers. Hispanic pay-TV subscribers in the U.S. are expected to grow, driven by the continued long-term growth in Hispanic television households and by increased penetration of pay-TV among Hispanics.

           Cinelatino is also distributed by many Latin American pay television distributors, generally on basic video packages, and has approximately 16.8 million subscribers in more than 15 countries throughout Latin America. Cinelatino is presently distributed to only 30% of all pay-TV subscribers throughout Latin America (excluding Brazil), representing a significant growth opportunity. 
   Pasiones 
         Pasiones, launched in August 2008, focuses on one of the most popular program genres among Hispanics, telenovelas. The network sets itself apart by showcasing telenovelas produced in Latin America, Turkey, South Korea, India and other countries (dubbed into Spanish), in contrast to competitor networks such as Univision Tlnovelas, which focus almost exclusively on Mexican telenovelas. This diverse programming strategy made Pasiones the #1 novela network in prime time in 2018. In owning both Pasiones and Cinelatino, we provide content in two of the most popular genres with Hispanics, telenovelas and movies. 
         Pasiones has two feeds of its service, one that is distributed in the U.S. and a second that is distributed throughout Latin America. Pasiones is distributed by most major U.S. cable, satellite and telecommunications operators on Hispanic Programming Packages and has approximately 4.4 million U.S. subscribers.

     Snap Media 
         On November 26, 2018, we acquired a 75% interest in Snap Media. Snap Media is a distributor of content to broadcast and cable television networks and OTT and SVOD platforms in Latin America. Snap will be responsible for the distribution of content owned and/or controlled by our networks, as well as content to be produced by the production joint venture between Snap Media and MarVista. 
   Joint Ventures/Investments 
         On November 3, 2016, we formed a joint venture with Lionsgate, pursuant to which we own a 25% interest in Pantaya, a Spanish-language OTT movie service. The service launched in the U.S. on August 1, 2017. The investment is deemed a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") that is accounted for under the equity method. 
         On November 30, 2016, we, in partnership with Colombian content producers, Radio Television Interamericana S.A., Compania de Medios de Informacion S.A.S. and NTC Nacional de Television y Comunicaciones S.A., were awarded a ten (10) year renewable television broadcast concession license for Canal 1 in Colombia. Canal 1 is one of only three national broadcast television networks in Colombia. The partnership began operating Canal 1 on May 1, 2017. Canal 1 is the #3-rated broadcast television network in Colombia. At December 31, 2018, we owned a 40% interest in the joint venture, which is deemed a VIE that is accounted for under the equity method. 
         On April 28, 2017, we acquired a 25.5% interest in REMEZCLA, digital media company targeting English speaking and bilingual U.S. Hispanic millennials through innovative content. The investment is deemed a VIE that is accounted for under the equity method. 
         For more information on Pantaya, Canal 1 and REMEZCLA, see Note 5, "Equity Method Investments" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report. 
   OUR COMPETITION 
         We compete for the development and acquisition of programming, distribution of our Networks, selling of commercial time on our Networks, viewership of our Networks, and on-air and creative talent. Our Networks compete with other Spanish-language broadcast and cable television networks and digital media companies for the acquisition of programming, viewership, the sale of advertising and creative talent. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content impacts our viewership and the sale of advertising. 
         We also compete with both Spanish-language and English-language broadcast and cable television networks for distribution of our Networks and the fees paid by cable, satellite and telecommunication service providers. Our ability to retain and secure distribution agreements is necessary to maintain and grow affiliate revenue, and to attain viewership which drives advertising sales. Our contractual agreements with Distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The launch of new networks and consolidation within the cable and satellite distribution industry may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain distribution of our Networks. 
         Certain technological advances, including the increased deployment of fiber optic cable, are expected to allow cable and telecommunication video service providers to continue to expand both their channel and broadband distribution capacities and to increase transmission speeds. In addition, the ability to deliver content via new methods and devices is expected to increase substantially. The impact of such added capacities is hard to predict, but the development of new channels of content distribution could lead to increased competition for viewers by facilitating the emergence of additional channels and mobile and internet platforms through which viewers could view programming that is similar to that offered by our Networks.

           WAPA competes with broadcast television networks and cable television networks in Puerto Rico for audience viewership, advertising sales, and programming. WAPA's main competitors are broadcast television stations owned by Univision and Telemundo, which rely heavily on their U.S. parents for programming, consisting primarily of telenovelas produced in Mexico, the U.S. and Latin America. There are a few other local broadcasters, but they tend not to be competitive due to weak programming and/or poor signal quality. In addition, while all major English-language U.S. broadcast networks have local affiliates, they are, for the most part, low power stations with nominal ratings. Cable channels are generally not competitive, as they tend to be U.S.-based, English-language channels with little relevance to the Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican audience, and pay television is much less widely penetrated in Puerto Rico than the U.S. WAPA has effectively customized its programming for the viewing preferences of the Puerto Rican market with more local entertainment and news programming than its competitors, as well as blockbuster Hollywood movies and hit U.S. television series (dubbed into Spanish). As a result, since the start of Nielsen audience measurement, WAPA has been the ratings leader for the past nine years. WAPA Deportes competes for viewership, advertising sales and programming with other channels offering similar sports programming in Puerto Rico. Competitors include U.S.-based cable networks, such as ESPN, TNT, and TBS, and certain satellite distributors who have acquired sports media rights for their owned channels. WAPA.TV, WAPA's mobile-optimized website, directly competes with other local news, weather and entertainment sites for traffic and advertising sales. To some extent, WAPA.TV also competes with search engines and social networks, such as Google and Facebook, for digital advertising revenue. 
         Many of our competitors may possess greater resources than us, and our financial resources may be relatively limited when contrasted with many of these competitors. 
   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
         Our intellectual property assets principally include copyrights in television programming, websites and other content, trademarks in brands, names and logos, domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. The protection of our Networks' brands and content is of primary importance to our success. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and internet/domain name statutes, laws and contractual provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly. We seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches. However, the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work. 
         Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signal, and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. 
   INDUSTRY 
   U.S. Hispanic Market 
         The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 58.9 million Hispanics resided in the United States in 2017, representing an increase of more than 23 million people between 2000 and 2017. Hispanics represent the largest minority group in the U.S. at over 18% of the total U.S. population and accounted for over half of the total U.S. population growth between 2000 and 2017. This trend is 
 11

   expected to continue as the U.S. Hispanic population is projected to grow to 75 million by 2030, an increase of 27% from 2017. As a result of this growth, the U.S. Hispanic market represents the largest Hispanic economy in the world. In addition, the Hispanic population on average is significantly younger than the overall population. For example, the median age of U.S. Hispanics is 29, which is 11 years younger than the median age for non-Hispanic whites. 
         Claritas estimates that in 2018 about 66% of the U.S. Hispanic population was of Mexican origin, followed by Puerto Rican, the second largest Hispanic national group, at 10%. There are 6.1 million Puerto Ricans and an additional 5.9 million Hispanics from other Caribbean countries residing in the U.S., and together, Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean Hispanics represent 19% of the total U.S. Hispanic population. The Puerto Rican population in the U.S. grew 80% from 2000 to 2018, while the overall Caribbean Hispanic population grew 101% during the same time period, including the Dominican population which grew 232% from 2000-2018.

     Hispanic Television and Pay-TV Landscape 
         Within the U.S. cable network industry, the U.S. Hispanic demographic is attractive for a number of reasons:
 

 Growth in Hispanic TV households: U.S. Hispanic television households grew by 26% during the period from 2010 to 2019, from 12.9 million
households to 16.2 million households, nearly seven times the overall U.S. television household growth of only 4%. The continued long-term growth of Hispanic television households creates a
significant opportunity to reach an attractive audience at a time when overall household growth in the U.S. is more modest. 
 Growth in Hispanic pay-TV subscribers: Hispanic pay-TV subscribers are expected to continue to grow, driven not only by the rapid growth in
Hispanic television households, but also by the increased penetration of pay-TV among Hispanics. Hispanic pay-TV subscribers increased 4% from 2010 to 2019, growing from 10.8 million to
11.2 million subscribers. This 4% growth in Hispanic pay-TV subscribers is impressive compared to the 12% decline in overall U.S. pay-TV subscribers during the same period. 

 Television Viewing and Language Preferences 
 

 Hispanics Enjoy Movies: In 2017, while Hispanics made up 18% of the U.S. population, they comprised 24% of the country's frequent moviegoers
(i.e., those who attend movies at least once per month). In fact, the President of the National Association of Theater Owners described Hispanics as "the most valuable component of moviegoers."
In 2017, Hispanics saw 4.5 movies per year, higher than any other ethnicity group. 
 Hispanics Prefer Television in Spanish: Spanish remains the most used language in the home by U.S. Hispanic adults, and this powerfully
influences television viewing habits. According to Nielsen, 59% of Hispanics aged 18 and over speak Spanish as much as or more than English in their homes. Spanish-dominant or bilingual
(Spanish/English Equal) homes comprise about 64% of U.S. Hispanic households, and these homes exhibit a strong preference to watch television in their native language. In 2018, Spanish-dominant
households viewed 59% of television in Spanish and bilingual homes viewed about 36% of television in Spanish. 

 Hispanic Advertising Market 
         Persons living in Hispanic television households represent 18% of the total U.S. television household population and over 10% of the total U.S. buying power, but the aggregate media spend targeted at U.S. Hispanics significantly under-indexes both of these metrics. As a result, advertisers have been allocating a higher proportion of marketing dollars to the Hispanic market, but U.S. Hispanic cable advertising still under-indexes relative to its consumption. 
         Similar to the under-indexing of U.S. general market cable advertising relative to viewing share in the 1980's and 1990's, U.S. Hispanic cable advertising today significantly under-indexes relative to its share of the Spanish-language television audience. In 2018, U.S. Hispanic cable networks garnered only 6% of total U.S. Hispanic national television advertising, while accounting for a 31% share of total Spanish-language television viewing. Viewing of Spanish-language cable networks as a percentage of total Spanish-language television viewing has grown dramatically from 11% in 2008 to 31% in 2018. 
   Latin American Market (excluding Brazil) 
         Latin America remains an attractive region due to its large population, shared language, strong economic growth and growing discretionary spending. Pay-TV subscribers in Latin America grew by 32% from 2013 to 2018, and are projected to grow an additional 10 million from 57 million in 2018 to 67 million by 2022 representing projected growth of 18%. Pay-TV penetration of television households 
 13

   has expanded from 46% in 2013 to 55% in 2018 and is projected to reach 60% by 2022. This growth is expected to be driven by a sizeable and growing population, as well as a strong macroeconomic backdrop and rising disposable income across geographies. In addition, investments in network infrastructure have improved service and performance, leading to increased penetration for pay-TV operators. 
   Puerto Rico Overview 
         The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and has a U.S. dollar-based economy, U.S. rule of law and strong governmental ties to the United States. The broadcast television industry in Puerto Rico is regulated by the FCC, and the banking system is regulated under the U.S. system (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). As of January 2017 (the latest date for which data is available), Puerto Rico had a population of approximately 3.3 million, with an additional 6.1 million Puerto Ricans living in the mainland U.S. All Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. 
 Economy 
         The Puerto Rican economy has been in a recession since 2006, and its gross national product (GNP) has contracted in real terms every year between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2016 (except for growth of 0.5% in fiscal year 2012). Puerto Rico has been burdened by limited economic activity, lower-than-estimated revenue collections, high government debt levels relative to the size of the economy and other fiscal challenges. On June 30, 2016, President Obama signed HR 5278 Bill, the "Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which, among other things, established a seven-member Federally-appointed oversight board (the "Oversight Board") with broad powers over the finances of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and provides to the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities, broad-based restructuring authority, including through a bankruptcy-type process similar to that of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Commonwealth's inability to access financing in the capital markets or from private lenders, has resulted in the Commonwealth and various public corporations defaulting on their public debt and entering into bankruptcy proceedings under PROMESA. 
         During the month of September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, two major hurricanes, caused extensive destruction in Puerto Rico. Hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20, 2017, and all of Puerto Rico was left without electrical power, and other basic infrastructure services (such as water, communications, ports and other transportation networks) were severely curtailed. Additionally, the hurricanes also accelerated the outmigration trends that Puerto Rico was experiencing, with increased numbers of residents moving to the mainland United States, either on a temporary or permanent basis. The hurricanes caused a significant disruption to the island's economic activity and GNP. 
         Puerto Rico continues in its efforts to rebuild its infrastructure and to otherwise recover from the impact of Hurricane Maria in 2017, aided in part by Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies. An indicator of such infrastructure recovery is seen in cement production which increased 7.4% and sales increased 3.5% during January 2019 as compared to January 2018. The extent and duration of such aid is inherently uncertain. In 2018, as part of the Title III proceedings under PROMESA, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico submitted several draft fiscal plans to the Oversight Board, each of which purported to reflect the government's expected economic outlook for Puerto Rico over a five year period after taking into account, among other factors: (i) the negative impact of Hurricane Maria, (ii) mitigating impact of disaster relief assistance, (iii) changes to revenue and expense measures, and (iv) the impact of structural reforms. On October 23, 2018, the Oversight Board voted to certify the most recent Commonwealth fiscal plan, which reflects a $17.0 billion surplus over a six-year period assuming some levels of debt service. This fiscal plan has been approved and certified by the Financial Oversight and Management Board of Puerto Rico. According to the projections of this fiscal plan, Puerto Rico should receive $12B during the fiscal year 2019. Although some of the impact 
 14

   of the hurricanes, including its short-term impact on economic activity, may be offset by recovery and reconstruction activity and the influx of Federal emergency funds and private insurance proceeds, it is too early to know the total amount of Federal and private insurance money to be received and whether such transfers will significantly offset the negative economic, fiscal and demographic impact of the hurricanes. Although the current fiscal plan estimates a GNP growth of 7.8% and 5.5% in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively, other economic estimates have these numbers at much lower levels between 2.8%-3.1% for 2019, and 3.4%-4.2% for 2020. This more conservative estimate assumes lower than expected reconstruction investment and external factors like US recession in 2019. 
         PROMESA is an important step towards reducing the level of uncertainty in Puerto Rico and provides a groundwork for an orderly debt restructuring process, however, ultimate outcomes of actions to address the challenging Puerto Rico economic environment are uncertain at this time. On February 4, 2019, the District Court entered an order approving the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment for Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation ("COFINA"), including the settlement agreement between the Commonwealth and COFINA. The effective date of the Plan was February 12, 2019. There can be no assurance that any past or new actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will achieve their intended effect. 
   Puerto Rico Broadcast Television Market 
         Puerto Rico has 1.3 million television households, comparable to that of a top 25 U.S. television market. Puerto Rico is the third largest U.S. Hispanic market behind Los Angeles and New York. 
         Puerto Rican television broadcasters capture the dominant share of viewership, which is unique relative to the U.S. The three primary broadcasters in Puerto RicoWAPA, Univision and Telemundocollectively garner approximately 73% of all television household viewership in primetime, distinguishing Puerto Rico from the U.S. television market, where the four major national broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox) garner a collective primetime audience share of 18%. In fact, WAPA's primetime household rating in 2018 was four times higher than the most highly rated English-language U.S. broadcast network in the U.S., NBC, and higher than the combined ratings of CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX and the CW. 
   GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
         Our broadcast and cable network operations are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the United States, Puerto Rico and other countries where they operate. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our Business are constantly subject to change. This section contains a summary of certain government regulations that may affect our operations. This information is summary in nature and does not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our Business. 
 Introduction 
         Our Networks are subject to regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended ("Communications Act"). Under authority of the Communications Act, the FCC, among other things, assigns frequency bands for broadcast stations, including the WAPA stations, and other uses; determines the location, frequency and operating power of stations; grants permits and licenses to construct and operate television stations on particular frequencies; issues, revokes, modifies and renews television broadcast station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses; and adopts and implements regulations and policies which directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operations and profitability of broadcasting stations. 
 15



        The FCC has also adopted various rules that regulate the content of programming broadcast by television stations, including the WAPA station, and carried by cable networks, including our Cable Networks. These rules regulate, among other things, children's programming, sponsorship identification disclosures, closed captioning of certain television programming, and obscene, indecent and profane content. Additionally, the FCC's rules require broadcast stations to implement equal employment opportunity outreach programs and maintain records relating to these programs and make filings with the FCC evidencing such efforts. The FCC could also adopt other regulations that affect cable networks, such as the requirement that the cable programming services be on an "á la carte" basis, which could affect their business operations. 
         The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act, and specific FCC rules and policies and certain other statutes and regulations. The summaries are not intended to describe all present and proposed statutes and FCC rules and regulations that impact broadcast television and cable network operations. Failure to observe the provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC's rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, the grant of "short-term" (less than the maximum term) broadcast license renewals or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a broadcast license renewal application, the revocation of a broadcast license, or the withholding of approval for acquisition of additional broadcast properties. 
   FCC Licenses and Renewal 
         The Communications Act permits the operation of a broadcast station only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants broadcast licenses for specified periods of time and, upon application, may renew the licenses for additional terms (ordinarily for the full term of eight years). Generally, the FCC renews a broadcast license upon a finding that (i) the broadcast station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC's rules; and (iii) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or other FCC rules which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. After considering these factors, the FCC may renew a broadcast station's license, either with conditions or without, or it may designate the renewal application for hearing. In 2013, the FCC renewed our television licenses for full eight year terms expiring in 2021. 
   Media Ownership Restrictions and FCC Proceedings 
         The FCC's broadcast ownership rules affect the number, type and location of broadcast and newspaper properties that we are allowed to hold or acquire. The FCC is required by statute to review all of its broadcast ownership rules every four years to determine if such rules remain necessary in the public interest. In 2017, the FCC relaxed certain ownership rules. The revised rules limit the common ownership, directly or by way of attribution, operation or control of television stations serving the same area. The rules also limit the aggregate national audience reach of television stations under common ownership, directly or by way of attribution. The FCC's rules also define the types of positions and interests that are considered attributable for purposes of the ownership limits. In general, officers, directors and stockholders holding 5% or more of the voting interests in Hemisphere are deemed to have attributable interests. The FCC's ownership limits therefore apply to our principals and certain investors in our Company. Because we are controlled by a single stockholder holding a majority of the voting power of our capital stock, the FCC's current rules do not treat other five percent or greater voting stockholders as attributable, and those ownership interests are not required to be reported to the FCC. 
         In December 2017, the FCC opened a notice of proposed rulemaking to review the national television audience reach cap and the 50% discount that is given to UHF stations in determining compliance with the national audience cap. That proposed rulemaking remains pending as of the date of this Annual Report. 
 16

     Local Television Ownership Rule 
         Under the local television ownership rule, one party may own, operate, or control up to two television stations in a market, so long as at least one of the stations is not one of the top-four-rated stations (based on audience share) in the television market. However, the FCC will allow case-by-case review of a transaction that involves two top-four stations where strict application of the rule would be unwarranted. The rule also permits the ownership, operation or control of two television stations in a market as long as the stations' Noise Limited Service contours do not overlap. The local television ownership rule, including the provision allowing for case-by-case waivers for acquisitions of two top- four stations, is subject to an appeal brought by several public interest organizations with the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the same court that has considered challenges to prior ownership rule changes adopted by the FCC. Broadcast stations designated by the FCC as "satellite" stations are exempt from the local television ownership rule. WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV have been designated by the FCC as "satellite" stations of WAPA-TV, a division of WAPA. The FCC may also waive its local television ownership rule to permit ownership, operation or control of two television stations in a market that would not otherwise be permissible if one of the stations is in involuntary bankruptcy, is a "failed" station, or is "failing" (i.e., stations with negative cash flow and less than a four share all day audience rating). Under the local television ownership rule, the licensee of a television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market station's weekly programming or advertising will be deemed to have an attributable interest in the other station. In December 2018, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to launch its statutorily mandated quadrennial review of multiple ownership rules, including the local television ownership rule, to determine whether the rules remain necessary in the public interest. 
 Attribution of Ownership 
         Pursuant to FCC rules, the following relationships and interests are generally considered attributable for purposes of broadcast ownership restrictions: (i) all officers and directors of a corporate licensee and its direct or indirect parent(s); (ii) voting stock interests of at least five percent; (iii) voting stock interests of at least 20 percent, if the holder is a passive institutional investor (such as an investment company, bank, or insurance company); (iv) any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company, unless properly "insulated" from management activities; (v) equity and/or debt interests that in the aggregate exceed 33 percent of a licensee's total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15 percent of the station's total weekly programming or is a same-market broadcast company or daily newspaper publisher; (vi) time brokerage of a broadcast station by a same-market broadcast company; and (vii) same-market radio joint sales agreements. Because we are controlled by a single stockholder holding a majority of the voting power of our capital stock, the FCC's current rules do not treat other five percent or greater voting stockholders as attributable, and those ownership interests are not required to be reported to the FCC. Pending before the FCC is a proposal to eliminate the single majority shareholder exception. The FCC is also considering a proposal to require the disclosure in biennial ownership reports of information about five percent or greater voting shareholders, even if such interests are not attributable under the FCC's ownership rules. 
         Management services agreements and other types of shared services arrangements between same-market stations that do not include attributable time brokerage components generally are not deemed attributable under the FCC's current ownership rules. However, the FCC now requires that television stations make any shared services agreements available in a station's public inspection file. 
   Commission Approval of Transfer of Control of FCC Licenses 
         The FCC's prior approval is required for the transfer of control or assignment of FCC licenses. We are currently controlled by Gato Investments LP ("Gato"), which owns a majority of our Class B common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Class B common stock"). The FCC's prior consent would 
 17

   be required prior to any transaction that would result in a change in control of Hemisphere or Gato. An application for consent to a transfer of control or assignment of licenses would be subject to a formal public notice and comment period during which petitions to deny the applications would be accepted by the FCC. 
         A person or entity requesting the FCC's consent to acquire or obtain control of our television station licenses must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC's ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the public interest. As discussed above, we own two television stations, WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV, which are operated as "satellite" stations of WAPA-TV. Stations granted satellite status are exempt from the FCC's local television ownership rule. Thus, this status permits the common ownership of the three WAPA broadcast stations that would not otherwise be permitted. WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV were first accorded satellite status in 2001 due to the unique circumstances of the Puerto Rico market, including its topography and economic conditions, and the FCC has renewed this grant in subsequent transactions. We anticipate the FCC would continue to grant satellite status to WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV in future change-in-control transactions. 
   Alien Ownership Restrictions 
         Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any corporation that has more than 20% of its capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities, whom the FCC refers to as "aliens," or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. 
         Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC broadcast license may be granted to or held by any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of the capital stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations, if the FCC finds the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships and limited liability companies. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before a broadcast license may be granted to or held by any such entity. In the past, the FCC has made such an affirmative finding with respect to broadcast licenses only in highly limited circumstances. In 2013, however, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling that notwithstanding its past practices, it will consider on a case-by-case basis requests for approval of acquisitions by aliens of in excess of 25% of the capital stock of the parent of a broadcast licensee. In 2016, the FCC adopted rules to simplify the process for submitting a declaratory ruling and modifying the procedures for the foreign ownership approval process for broadcast station licensees. In acting upon a request for declaratory ruling, the FCC will coordinate with Executive Branch agencies on national security, law enforcement, foreign policy and trade policy issues. The new rules also specify how public companies should monitor foreign ownership compliance and provide for remedial provisions in the event a public company determines that it has exceeded its foreign ownership limits. 
         On January 18, 2017, the FCC granted our request to allow foreign investors or aliens to own up to 49.99% of our capital stock and hold 49.99% of the voting power. However, we are required to obtain specific approval from the FCC before any alien acquires more than 5% of our capital stock or more than 5% voting rights, other than certain foreign investors that the FCC approved in the declaratory ruling. We are also required to take remedial actions with the FCC if we determine that an unapproved alien has acquired more than 5% of our capital stock or voting rights. In September 2018, the FCC approved a modification of the original request to permit additional entities to own up to 49.99 percent of our capital stock and up to 49.99 percent of our voting power. 
         To the extent necessary to comply with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, and the declaratory ruling, our board of directors may (i) prohibit the ownership, voting or transfer of any 
 18

   portion of our outstanding capital stock to the extent the ownership, voting or transfer of such portion would cause us to violate or would otherwise result in violation of any provision of the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC's declaratory ruling; (ii) convert shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock to the extent necessary to bring us into compliance with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC's declaratory ruling; and (iii) redeem capital stock to the extent necessary to bring us into compliance with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC's declaratory ruling or to prevent the loss or impairment of any of our FCC licenses. 
   Digital Television 
         As of June 12, 2009, all full-power broadcast television stations were required to cease broadcasting analog programming and convert to all digital broadcasts. Digital broadcasting allows stations to offer digital channels for a wide variety of services such as high definition video programming, multiple channels of standard definition video programming, such as WAPA Deportes, data, and other types of communications. Each station is required to provide at least one free over-the-air video program signal. 
         To the extent a station has "excess" digital capacity (i.e., digital capacity not used to transmit free, over-the-air video programming), it may elect to use that capacity in any manner consistent with FCC technical requirements, including for data transmission, interactive or subscription video services, or paging and information services. If a station uses its digital capacity to provide any such "ancillary or supplementary" services on a subscription or otherwise "feeable" basis, it must pay the FCC an annual fee equal to 5% of the gross revenues realized from such services. 
         In 2017, the FCC adopted rules authorizing the deployment of the Next Generation broadcast television transmission standard, also called ATSC 3.0. ATSC 3.0 is an Internet Protocol-based broadcast transmission platform that merges the capabilities of over-the-air broadcasting with the broadband viewing and information delivery methods of the Internet, using the same 6 MHz channels presently allocated for digital television service. Stations are not obligated to use ATSC 3.0; use of the new standard is voluntary. We cannot predict what impact the new standard will have on our Business. 
   MVPD Retransmission of Local Television Signals 
         A number of provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules govern aspects of the relationship between broadcast television stations and distributors of multiple channels of video programming such as cable, satellite and telecommunications companies (referred to as "MVPDs"). The rules generally provide certain protections for local broadcast stations, for which MVPDs are an important means of distribution and a provider of competing program channels. 
         To ensure that every local television station can be received in its local market without requiring a cable subscriber to switch between cable and off-air signals, the FCC allows every full-power television broadcast station to require that all local cable systems and direct broadcast satellite transmit that station's primary digital channel to their subscribers within the station's market (the so-called "must-carry" rule). Alternatively, a station may elect to forego its must-carry rights and seek a negotiated agreement to establish the terms of its carriage by a local MVPDreferred to as "retransmission consent." A station electing retransmission consent assumes the risk that it will not be able to strike a deal with the MVPD and will not be carried. A station has the opportunity to elect must-carry or retransmission consent every three years. Elections were made in October 2017 for the 2018-2020 three-year period. WAPA elected retransmission consent and has entered into retransmission consent contracts with all MVPD systems serving Puerto Rico. 
         MVPDs are not required to carry any programming streams other than a station's primary video programming channel. Consequently, WAPA's multicast channel WAPA Deportes is not entitled to 
 19

   mandatory carriage under the FCC's must-carry rules. However, we are free to negotiate with MVPDs for the carriage of additional programming streams. 
         In 2014, the FCC adopted rules prohibiting a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top four stations to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another station, if the stations are not commonly owned and serve the same geographic market. Congress tightened this restriction to prohibit joint negotiation with any television station in the same market unless the stations are under common de jure control as part of the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014. In December 2014, the FCC issued a NPRM requesting comment on whether the definition of MVPD should be expanded to include providers that make multiple linear streams of video programming available for purchase, regardless of the technology used to distribute the programming (e.g. entities providing video programming to subscribers through internet connections). In September 2015, the FCC issued a NPRM to review one of the standards used to evaluate whether broadcast stations and MVPDs are negotiating for retransmission consent in good faith, referred to as the "totality of the circumstances test." These proceedings remain pending, and we cannot predict what impact, if any, they will have on our negotiations with video programming distributors. 
   Repurposing of Broadcast Spectrum for Other Uses 
         Federal legislation was enacted in February 2012 that, among other things, authorized the FCC to conduct voluntary "incentive auctions" in order to reallocate certain spectrum currently occupied by television broadcast stations to mobile wireless broadband services, to "repack" television stations into a smaller portion of the existing television spectrum band, and to require television stations that did not relinquish spectrum in the auction to modify their transmission facilities, subject to reimbursement for reasonable relocation costs up to an industry-wide total of $1.75 billion. 
         The FCC adopted rules concerning the incentive auction and the repacking of the television band and conducted the auction. Under the auction rules implemented by the FCC, television stations were given an opportunity to offer spectrum for sale to the government in a "reverse" auction whereafter wireless providers were permitted to bid to acquire spectrum from the government in a related "forward" auction. We filed an application to participate in the reverse auction. However, because the price to sell our spectrum fell below the value we ascribe to it, we did not sell any of our spectrum in the auction. The incentive auction concluded in the first half of 2017. The FCC is now in the process of "repacking" the remaining television broadcast spectrum, which requires that certain television stations that did not relinquish spectrum in the reverse auction modify their transmission facilities, including requiring such stations to operate on other channel designations. The FCC will reimburse stations for reasonable relocation costs. The original reimbursement limit across all stations was $1.75 billion. In March 2018, Congress authorized an additional $1 billion to be used for reimbursements related to repacking. When repacking, the FCC will make reasonable efforts to preserve a station's coverage area and population served. Stations WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV have been reassigned new channels as a result of the incentive auction. WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV transitioned to their new channels on August 1, 2018 and are currently operating with temporary facilities while construction of their permanent facilities is completed. 
         The outcome of the repacking of broadcast television spectrum and the impact of such on WAPA's business, cannot be predicted. Nevertheless, we do not believe that the auction will have a material negative impact on our Business, because with post-auction channel assignments our stations will remain in the more desirable UHF band; our three television stations have overlapping coverage areas, so it is unlikely that we will lose service to a significant portion of the households that we serve. If the FCC is unable to reimburse all of our repacking expenses, the amount of the shortfall is unlikely to be material to our Business as a whole. 
 20

     EEO Rules 
         The FCC's Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") rules impose job information dissemination, recruitment, documentation and reporting requirements on broadcast television stations. Broadcasters are also subject to random audits to ensure compliance with the FCC's EEO rules and may be sanctioned for noncompliance. 
   Recordkeeping 
         The FCC rules require broadcast television stations to maintain various records regarding operations, including equipment performance records and a log of the station's operating parameters. Television stations must also maintain a public inspection file, which is hosted on an FCC-maintained website. This file must contain various records, including the station license, FCC applications, contour maps, ownership reports, political broadcasting records, EEO public file reports, a copy of the manual "The Public and Broadcasting," material regarding FCC investigations or complaints, issues/programs lists, children's television programming reports, records concerning compliance with commercial limits in children's programming, time brokerage agreements and joint sales agreements, shared services agreements and statements of must-carry/retransmission elections. 
 Programming and Operations 
         Rules and policies of the FCC and other federal agencies regulate certain programming practices and other areas affecting the business or operations of broadcast stations, including WAPA, and cable networks, including WAPA America and Cinelatino. 
  Obscenity, Indecency and Profanity.    Federal statutes prohibit the broadcast or transmission of obscene material at any time by broadcast television stations, including the WAPA station, or on cable networks, including WAPA America and Cinelatino. The FCC's rules also prohibit television stations, including the WAPA station, from broadcasting indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. In recent years, the FCC has intensified its enforcement activities with respect to programming it considers indecent and has issued numerous fines to licensees found to have violated the indecency rules. 
         In 2018, the FCC implemented increased forfeiture amounts for indecency violations that were enacted by Congress. The maximum permitted fine for an indecency violation is $407,270 per incident and $3,759,410 for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. 
         Because the FCC may investigate indecency complaints on an ex parte basis, a licensee may not have knowledge of an indecency complaint unless and until the complaint results in the issuance of a formal FCC letter of inquiry or notice of apparent liability for forfeiture. In July 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a decision finding that the FCC's indecency standard was too vague for broadcasters to interpret and therefore inconsistent with the First Amendment. In June 2011, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in this case. In June 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision which held that the FCC could not fine ABC and FOX (two television networks that were fined for airing allegedly indecent material) for the specific broadcasts at issue because the FCC had not provided them with sufficient notice of its intent to issue fines for the use of fleeting expletives or momentary nudity. However, the Supreme Court did not make any substantive ruling regarding the FCC's current indecency policies. In April 2013, the FCC requested comments on its indecency policy, including whether to ban the use of fleeting expletives or whether it should only impose fines from broadcasts that involve repeated and deliberate use of expletives. The FCC has advised that it will continue to pursue enforcement actions in egregious cases while it conducts its review of its indecency policy generally. 
 21

    Children's Programming.    Federal statutes and FCC rules require broadcast television stations, including the WAPA station, to broadcast three hours per week of educational and informational programming ("E/I programming") designed for children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also require television stations to air E/I programming on each additional digital multicast program stream broadcast, with the requirement increasing in proportion to the additional hours of free programming offered on multicast channels. 
         Federal statutes and FCC rules also limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be included in programming primarily produced and carried for children 12 years and younger by broadcast television stations and cable networks, including WAPA America and Cinelatino. The FCC's rules also limit the display, during children's programming on broadcast stations and cable networks, of Internet addresses of websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products. In July 2018, the FCC released a NPRM seeking comment on revisions to the children's television programming rules to modify outdated requirements and to give broadcasters greater flexibility in serving the educational and informational needs of children. The NPRM remains pending and it cannot be predicted what modifications, if any, will result from it. 
         Some U.S. policymakers have sought limitations on food and beverage marketing in media popular with children and teens. In April 2011, the Interagency Working Group on Food Marketed to Children, which is comprised of the Federal Trade Commission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, jointly requested comment on proposed nutritional restrictions for food and beverage marketing directed to children and teens aged 17 years and under. Although the proposed guidelines are nominally voluntary, if these or other similar guidelines are implemented by food and beverage marketers, they could have a negative impact on our Networks advertising revenues. 
  Commercial Loudness.    The 2010 Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act ("CALM Act") and the FCC rules implementing the CALM Act, require television stations, cable television operators, satellite television providers, and other pay television providers to limit the average volume of commercials, including promotional announcements, to the same average volume as the programming it accompanies. The FCC rules do not specifically require video programming providers, such as WAPA America or Cinelatino, to comply with the rules regarding the loudness of commercials. However, video programming distributors may request or require by contract that programming providers certify compliance with those rules for commercials embedded in programming. 
  Closed Captioning.    FCC rules require the majority of programming broadcast by television stations and carried on cable networks to contain closed captions. In January 2012, the FCC adopted rules to require that television programming broadcast by television stations, including the WAPA station, or transmitted by cable, including on WAPA America or Cinelatino, with captioning include captioning if subsequently made available online, for example, by streaming on WAPA.TV. Clips of programming carried on television are required to be captioned if subsequently distributed over the internet. Additionally, beginning in March 2015, new FCC rules became effective that require programming captions to adhere to more stringent quality standards. In 2016, rules became effective requiring certain clips of programming made available online to be captioned if the underlying programming aired on television with captions. 
  Sponsorship Identification.    Both the Communications Act and the FCC's rules generally require that, when payment or other consideration has been received or promised to a broadcast television station for the airing of program material, the station must disclose that fact and identify who paid or promised to provide the consideration at the time of broadcast. Cable systems are subject to the same requirement when the system is originating programming, also known as cablecasting. In June 2008, the FCC sought comments on whether it should adopt additional regulations with respect to sponsorship identification requirements on cable programmers. That proceeding remains pending.

     Program Access Restrictions 
         Under the Communications Act, vertically integrated cable programmers are generally prohibited from offering different prices, terms, or conditions to competing multichannel video programming distributors unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the FCC's regulations. The FCC's "program access" rules previously limited the ability of a vertically integrated cable programmer to enter into exclusive distribution arrangements with cable television operators. However, in 2012, the FCC declined to extend the exclusive contract prohibition section of the program access rules beyond its October 5, 2012 sunset date. A cable programmer is considered to be vertically integrated if it owns or is owned by a cable television operator, in whole or in part, under the FCC's program access attribution rules. Cable television operators for this purpose may include telephone companies that provide video programming directly to subscribers. Because certain of our directors are also directors of cable companies, we are considered to be a vertically integrated cable programmer and are subject to the program access rules. 
   Regulation of the Internet 
         Internet services, including WAPA.TV, CINELATINO.COM, TVPASIONES.COM, CENTROAMERICATV.TV, TELEVISIONDOMINICANA.TV and SNAPTV.TV, are subject to regulation in the U.S. relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13, including the federal Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM). In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal, state, territorial laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. 
   Other Regulations 
         In addition to the regulations applicable to the broadcast, cable television and Internet industries in general, we are also subject to other federal, state, territorial, and local regulations, including, without limitation, regulations promulgated by federal, state, and territorial environmental, health and labor agencies. Cinelatino is also subject to laws and regulations that may be adopted or promulgated by the governments of other jurisdictions in which it operates.
