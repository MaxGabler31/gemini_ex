Item 1.  BUSINESS
Who We Are
InnovAge is the leading healthcare delivery platform by number of participants focused on providing all-inclusive, capitated care to high-cost, dual-eligible seniors. Our programs are designed to address two of the most pressing challenges facing the U.S. healthcare industry: rising costs and poor outcomes. Our participant-centered care delivery approach is designed to improve the quality of care our participants receive, while keeping them in their homes for as long as safely possible and reducing over-utilization of high-cost care settings such as hospitals and nursing homes. Our participant-centered approach is led by our Interdisciplinary Care Teams (“IDTs”), who design, manage and coordinate each participant’s personalized care plan. We directly manage and are responsible for all healthcare needs and associated costs, including housing costs where applicable, for our participants. We directly contract with government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and do not rely on third-party administrative organizations or health plans. We believe our model aligns with how healthcare is evolving, namely (i) the shift toward value-based care, in which coordinated, outcomes-driven, quality care is delivered while reducing unnecessary spend, (ii) eliminating excessive administrative costs by contracting directly with the government, (iii) focusing on the patient experience and (iv) addressing social determinants of health.
InnovAge Holding Corp. (formerly, TCO Group Holdings, Inc.) and certain wholly owned subsidiaries were formed as for-profit corporations effective May 13, 2016, for the purpose of purchasing all the outstanding common stock of Total Community Options, Inc. d/b/a InnovAge, which was formed in May 2007. In connection with this purchase, Total Community Options, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries converted from not-for-profit organizations to for-profit corporations, and Total Community Options Foundation, Inc. and Johnson Adult Day Program, Inc., both not-for-profit organizations, separated from Total Community Options, Inc. In connection with our initial public offering (“IPO”), which occurred in March 2021, we changed the name of our company from TCO Group Holdings, Inc. to InnovAge Holding Corp. (“InnovAge”). In the following text, the terms “we”, “our”, “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to InnovAge or collectively to InnovAge and its subsidiaries.
InnovAge is headquartered in Denver, Colorado. Our mission is to allow seniors in need of care and support to live life on their terms by aging in place, in their own homes and communities, for as long as safely possible. Through PACE, we manage, and in many cases directly provide, a broad range of medical and ancillary services for seniors, including in-home care services (skilled, unskilled and personal care); in-center services such as primary care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, dental services, mental health and psychiatric services, meals, and activities; transportation to the PACE center and third-party medical appointments; and care management. The Company manages its business as one reportable segment, PACE. 
PACE
As of June 30, 2022, the Company served approximately 6,650 PACE participants, making it the largest PACE provider in the United States of America (the “U.S.”) based on participants served, and operated 18 PACE centers across Colorado, California, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
PACE is a fully-capitated managed care program, which serves the frail elderly, and predominantly dual-eligible, population in a community-based service model. We define dual-eligible seniors as individuals who are 55+ and qualify for benefits under both Medicare and Medicaid. InnovAge provides all needed healthcare services through an all-inclusive, coordinated model of care, and the Company is at risk for 100% of healthcare costs incurred with respect to the care of its participants. PACE programs receive capitation payments directly from Medicare Parts C and D, Medicaid, Veterans Administration (“VA”), and private pay sources. Additionally, under the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) share part of the risk for providing prescription medication to the Company’s participants. We deliver our participant-centered care through the InnovAge Platform, which is designed to bring high-touch, comprehensive, value-based care.

We believe the traditional fee-for-service reimbursement model in healthcare does not adequately incentivize providers to efficiently manage this complex population. Dual-eligible seniors must navigate a disjointed, separately administered set of Medicare and Medicaid benefits, which often results in uncoordinated care delivered in silos. Our vertically integrated care model and full-risk contracts incentivize us to coordinate and manage all aspects of a participant’s health. Costs under the PACE program are estimated to be 13% lower on average than for a comparable dual-eligible population aged 65 and older under Medicaid, based on an analysis of available data by the National PACE Association in November 2020. Importantly, we believe we can deliver better health outcomes. Our care model reduces unnecessary or avoidable medical spend. Based on an analysis performed using the data most recently available to us from 2018, we estimate that across our mature markets, our participants on average have 16% fewer hospital admissions and 73% fewer low- to medium-severity emergency room visits relative to a comparable Medicare fee-for-service population with similar risk scores for which data is available. In addition, as of June 30, 2022, our participants had a 23% lower 30-day hospital readmission rate compared to a frail, dual-eligible or disabled waiver population. In addition to reducing spend, we also focus on ensuring our participants are satisfied and receive the necessary care. Our participant satisfaction, based on our most recent survey of participants administered by an independent third party as of January 1, 2022, is 81%. 
We believe our value proposition to each constituency translates into a predictable economic model. We directly contract with Medicare and Medicaid on a per member, per month (“PMPM”) basis, which creates recurring revenue streams and provides significant visibility into our revenue trajectory. We receive 100% of the pooled capitated payment to directly provide or manage the healthcare needs of our participants. 
Industry Challenges
Unsustainable and rising healthcare costs. According to data from the Office of the Actuary of CMS, healthcare spending in the United States grew at approximately 5% per year from 2015 to 2020, and in 2020 represented $4.1 trillion of annual spend, or 19.7% of U.S. GDP. The overall growth rate of healthcare spending is expected to accelerate due to the aging population. 
Government healthcare spend is disproportionally concentrated in the dual-eligible population, who typically suffer from multiple chronic conditions and require long-term services and supports. Medicare and Medicaid spend on average three times more per capita on a dual-eligible senior than a Medicare-only senior. Improved care management of dual-eligible seniors is critical to reducing the rapid growth in government healthcare spending in the United States.
Highly fragmented, uncoordinated healthcare system. The U.S. healthcare system is complex and highly fragmented, resulting in piecemeal care delivery across different providers who each lack a complete picture of the patient. Furthermore, this dynamic often makes the healthcare system difficult for patients to navigate. Primary, acute, behavioral and long-term care providers need to work together to effectively manage a patient’s care, yet, today, they often work in silos. This lack of care coordination can result in missed or inaccurate diagnoses, gaps in care, unnecessary spend and ultimately sub-optimal patient outcomes.

High-cost, dual-eligible seniors are at high risk of falling through the cracks of the U.S. healthcare system. Few government-sponsored programs other than PACE bring together the Medicare and Medicaid benefit for these individuals, creating further barriers to delivering coordinated care. Dual-eligible beneficiaries are among the most medically complex, high-frequency users of healthcare services. Based on InnovAge data as of June 30, 2022, the typical InnovAge participant had, on average, eight chronic conditions and, based on the data most recently available to us from a 2018 health outcomes survey, required, on average, assistance with two or more activities of daily living (“ADLs”). A lack of coordination across providers can have severe consequences given the high occurrence of chronic illnesses and other underlying health issues in this population.
Prevalence of wasteful spending and sub-optimal outcomes. A 2019 study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, estimated that approximately 25% of all annual healthcare spending is for unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud and other inefficiencies creating waste. 
Proper management of chronic conditions and targeted interventions to mitigate challenges presented by social determinants of health can significantly reduce the incidence of acute episodes, which are the main driver of emergency room visits and hospitalization among the dual-eligible senior population. Healthcare spending on nursing care facilities 

2



and continuing care retirement communities was expected to reach approximately $188.1 billion in 2022, based on the latest projections made by the Office of the Actuary of CMS, which is a 6.4% decrease compared to the 2022 projection from the prior year. Similar to spend on hospitals and other high-acuity care settings, we believe many of these dollars can ultimately be saved by providing proactive treatment and investing in proper medical and social supports to enable frail seniors to live in their homes and communities.
Despite high levels of spending, the U.S. healthcare system struggles to produce better health outcomes and delivers low levels of patient and provider satisfaction. 
Payment structures are evolving to address healthcare issues. Policymakers and healthcare experts generally acknowledge that the fee-for-service model is not designed to deliver on the “triple aim” of providing low-cost, high-quality care while improving the patient experience. Historically, healthcare delivery was oriented around reactive care for acute events, which resulted in the development of a fee-for-service payment model. By linking payments to the volume of encounters and pricing for higher complexity interventions, the fee-for-service model does not incentivize providers to practice preventative medicine or manage patients in lower cost settings. Rather, many policymakers and healthcare experts believe it unintentionally creates the opposite result—acute, episodic care delivered in high-cost settings that unnecessarily drive up the total cost of healthcare.
High-cost, dual-eligible seniors often require proactive, coordinated care plans to address their medical acuity, need for long term support and risks related to social determinants of health. Without personalized, patient-centered care that removes barriers to preventative or other early treatment, high-cost, dual-eligible seniors would continue to likely over-utilize healthcare in higher-cost settings, such as emergency rooms and nursing homes.
Government payors have responded by incentivizing a transition to value-based reimbursement models for dual-eligible seniors. A recent example of this has been the growth of the PACE program.
PACE is a government-sponsored, provider-led managed care program focused on enabling frail, dual-eligible seniors who qualify to live in a nursing home to age independently in their homes. PACE providers receive a monthly risk-adjusted payment for each participant (PMPM) directly from Medicare and Medicaid to oversee the totality of medical care an enrolled participant needs. Fully capitated models, such as PACE, incentivize organizations to better manage chronic conditions to avoid high-cost acute episodes and to invest in services that fall outside the scope of a fee-for-service model. These services, such as care coordination and ancillary support to remove barriers created by social determinants of health, can have a significant impact on a participant’s overall health.
InnovAge participants are, on average, more complex and medically fragile than other Medicare-eligible patients, including those in average Medicare Advantage (“MA”) programs. As a result, we receive larger payments for our participants compared to MA participants. This is driven by two factors: (i) we provide care for a higher acuity population, with an average Medicare Risk Adjustment Factor (“RAF”) score of 2.40 based on InnovAge data as of June 30, 2022, compared to an average RAF score of 1.08 for Medicare fee-for-service non-dual enrollees, as calculated in an analysis by Avalere Health in June 2020 of a cohort of individuals enrolled in Medicare Fee-for-Service in 2019, and (ii) we have Medicaid spend in addition to Medicare. Our comprehensive care model and globally capitated payments are designed to cover participants from enrollment until the end of life, including coverage for participants requiring hospice and palliative care.
The successful clinical approaches of PACE helped inform certain aspects of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation’s Global and Professional Direct Contracting (“GPDC”) Model which began in 2021. The GPDC Model is an alternative Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) model that aims to create value-based payment arrangements directly with provider groups for their current Medicare fee-for-service patients. By transitioning from fee-for-service arrangements to value-based payments, CMS expects healthcare providers will be financially incentivized to simultaneously improve quality while lowering the cost of care and focusing on patient experience, as is done in PACE today.
Legacy healthcare delivery infrastructure has been slow to transition from fee-for-service to value-based care models. In order for the shift to value-based payment models to drive meaningful results, we believe there must be a corresponding shift in care delivery models. While there has been significant investment by providers, payors and technology companies 

3



in developing solutions to enable higher-quality and lower-cost care, the healthcare industry is still heavily reliant on fee-for-service reimbursement models.
The COVID-19 pandemic amplified several flaws in the current legacy healthcare delivery system. Traditional healthcare providers faced dwindling fee-for-service visits during the stay-at-home orders, government restrictions and general patient fear of medical settings. This not only reduced revenues for traditional providers, but also strained their ability to provide necessary care for their patients. Patients in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, also saw and continue to see a disproportionately high infection rate as a result of the pandemic. The highly contagious nature of the virus that causes COVID-19 combined with the higher mortality rate in frail seniors created devastating conditions that led to many avoidable deaths. 
Providers that operate comprehensive value-based models, like us, were better positioned to quickly pivot their care delivery approach to safely treat patients in virtual and home-based settings without losing any revenue. PACE participants had one-third the COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to the rates of nursing home residents as of June 30, 2021, according to an analysis performed by The New York Times. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for integrated, multimodal value-based care delivery models.
Our Market Opportunity
We are one of the largest healthcare platforms focused on frail, dual-eligible seniors, and we serve participants primarily through PACE. We have built the largest PACE-focused operation in the country based on number of participants; we are almost twice the size of our closest PACE-focused competitor, more than 30 times larger than the typical PACE operator and the only for-profit PACE operator with a footprint in three or more states. Given our scale across geographies, we believe we are positioned to capitalize on a significant market opportunity to provide care to frail, high-cost, dual-eligible seniors once restrictions on our ability to enroll participants as a result of the audits of our centers in Sacramento, California and Colorado and on our ability to open de novo centers as a result of actions taken by other states or us, are lifted or resolved.
Our care model targets the most complex, frail subset of the dual-eligible senior population. We estimated our target population at approximately 2.1 million in 2021 based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau from 2018, representing seniors who we believe are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and meet the nursing home eligibility criteria for PACE. We have historically and, once restrictions on our ability to enroll participants as a result of the audits on our centers in Sacramento, California and Colorado and on our ability to open de novo centers as a result of actions taken by other states or us, are lifted or resolved, expect to prioritize growth in high-density urban and suburban areas, where there are sizable numbers of frail dual-eligible seniors who would benefit most from our program. We leverage the InnovAge Platform which is designed to provide comprehensive, coordinated healthcare to enable our frail, nursing home-eligible seniors to live independently in their homes and communities. We believe people want to stay in their home for as long as possible, and the InnovAge Platform is designed to empower seniors to age independently in their own homes, on their own terms, for as long as possible.
Based on historical results for the year ended June 30, 2022 and our experience and industry knowledge, we estimate an average annual revenue opportunity of $98,000 per participant (or $8,200 PMPM) and a total addressable market opportunity of $220 billion, based on our estimated market of approximately 2.2 million PACE eligible in the United States in 2021, as described above. Of these estimated PACE eligible participants, only approximately 61,000 are enrolled in a PACE program, based on a July 2022 report from the National PACE Association, and over the next six years, the National PACE Association is targeting a PACE enrollment increase at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 20%. As a result, we believe that, subject to our ability to effectively remediate deficiencies identified during audits of our centers, we have a substantial opportunity for growth by bringing our comprehensive value-based model of care to more frail, dual-eligible seniors across the country.
The InnovAge Platform
Our participant-centered approach is tailored to address the complex medical and social needs of our frail dual-eligible senior population. We leverage the InnovAge Platform to deliver comprehensive, coordinated healthcare to our 

4



participants. The InnovAge Platform consists of (1) our interdisciplinary care teams and (2) our community-based care delivery model. The key attributes of the InnovAge Platform include:
Our participant focus. Our model is focused on caring for frail, high-cost, dual-eligible seniors. Our target participant population is the frail, nursing home-eligible subset of dual-eligible seniors to whom we refer as “high-cost, dual-eligibles” given their high healthcare acuity and the associated high level of spend. Our participants are among the most frail and medically complex individuals in the U.S. healthcare system. Based on InnovAge data as of June 30, 2022, the typical InnovAge participant had, on average, eight chronic conditions and, based on the data most recently available to us from a 2018 health outcomes survey, required, on average, assistance with three or more ADLs. As a result, the average InnovAge participant has a Medicare RAF of 2.40 based on InnovAge data as of June 30, 2022, compared to an average RAF score of 1.08 for Medicare fee-for-service non-dual enrollees, as calculated in an analysis by Avalere Health in June 2020 of a cohort of individuals enrolled in Medicare Fee-for-Service in 2019. A higher RAF score indicates poorer health and higher predicted health care costs. Our platform is designed to enable participants to exercise their preference to age independently in their homes and stay active in their communities for as long as safely possible. All of our participants are certified as nursing home-eligible. As of June 30 2022, over 90% of our participants are able to live safely in their homes and communities.
Our interdisciplinary care teams. The IDT structure is core to our clinical model. Our IDTs oversee all aspects of each participant’s unique care plan and function as the core group of care providers to our participants. Our IDT structure is designed to enhance access to care for our participants and eliminate information silos and gaps in care that frequently occur in a fee-for-service model. We are responsible for all of our participants’ medical care, and we direct care delivery across multiple settings. We deliver individualized care for each participant that addresses both his or her specific medical conditions and social determinants of health. We deliver or manage primary and specialist care, in-home care, hospital visits, nutrition, transportation to our care centers and to other medical appointments, pharmacy and behavioral health. We leverage a technology suite, which we believe is powered by industry-leading clinical and operational information technology solutions to collect and analyze data, streamline IDT workflows and empower our teams with timely participant insights that improve outcomes.
Each IDT convenes, at a minimum, experts across at least 11 disciplines to collectively manage the complex care needs of each participant. IDTs are typically comprised of a primary care provider, registered nurse, master’s level social worker, physical therapist, occupational therapist, recreational therapist or activity coordinator, dietician, center manager, home care coordinator, personal care attendant and driver. The IDTs meet multiple times per week to discuss each participant’s care plan and closely monitor key clinical metrics to ensure each participant receives optimal treatment based on his or her current conditions.
Our community-based care delivery model. Our high-touch model delivers care across a continuum of community-based settings. Our multimodal approach leverages (1) the care center, (2) the home and (3) virtual care capabilities to deliver comprehensive care to our participants. Our capitated payment model gives us the flexibility to invest in care coordination, transportation and other services to mitigate challenges presented by participants’ social determinants of health, regardless of what is traditionally covered by insurance. As a result, our capabilities are not limited to what we are able to offer inside of our centers.
Our community-based care centers. Our purpose-built community-based care centers are designed for the specific needs of our target population and serve as a medical and social hub for our participants. Our participants often spend the full day in these centers receiving medical treatment, meals and physical therapy and socializing with peers. Our care centers are larger than those of most other comparable care organizations and include dedicated spaces for medical care, physical therapy, behavioral health and dentistry, in addition to day-rooms and dining spaces for socialization among our participants. We incorporate population-specific design elements, such as grab bars and rounded hallways, to accommodate the frailty and the prevalence of dementia among our participant population. The size and design of our centers enable us to deliver a significant portion of our participants’ care in one location, simplifying the healthcare experience for participants and their families.
Our in-home care capabilities. Our in-home care capabilities are designed to enable our participants to live safely in their homes and avoid nursing homes to the extent safely possible. We directly deliver or manage all skilled and unskilled care a participant may require to live independently at home. Additionally, we have dedicated strategic partnerships with 

5



“hospital-at-home” providers to deliver acute care in-home when appropriate. In addition, we manage transportation not only to our centers but also to all third-party medical appointments. Our capitated payment model gives us the flexibility to invest in home modifications, such as ramps, grab bars and shower chairs, to reduce falls and make the home safer for our seniors. We believe our presence in our participants’ homes gives us real-time insight into our participants’ health and enables us to positively influence many environmentally-driven social determinants of health.
Our virtual care capabilities. Our virtual care capabilities give us the flexibility to deliver medical care and social services virtually when appropriate. Our physicians are equipped with several telehealth platforms to provide virtual care and utilize the option best suited for each individual participant’s preferences and needs. Our aim is to make virtual care access simple and convenient for our participants. In situations where a participant is unable to use telehealth technology on their own, we dispatch a team member to their home to assist.
We developed our telehealth capabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic highlighted the adaptability of the InnovAge Platform and our community-based care delivery model. Although participant attendance in the centers increased over the past fiscal year, our telehealth capabilities remain an important offering in our multimodal approach to deliver comprehensive care with 6% of our provider visits and 5% of IDT visits provided to our participants remotely during the year ended June 30, 2022.
Addressing social determinants of health. Our care delivery model is designed to provide services that mitigate challenges presented by participants’ social determinants of health, such as:

● | Economic stability
--+-------------------


● | Transportation
--+---------------


● | Physical environment
--+---------------------


● | Community and social context
--+-----------------------------


● | Food and nutrition
--+-------------------


● | Health literacy
--+----------------


● | Fitness
--+--------

​
Our technology suite. Our fully capitated care model is operationally complex; it requires coordination among dozens of different providers per participant, real-time integration of clinical data from disparate sources and predictive analytics to enable effective interventions. We license a suite of third-party clinical technologies that we use to create a comprehensive view of our participants’ health, empowering our IDTs to make optimal care decisions. We leverage what we believe to be industry-leading reporting and predictive analytics solutions to collect and analyze data, stratify our population and uncover actionable participant insights.
Fiscal Year 2022 Audit Processes and Remediation Efforts
In May 2021, CMS, together with other state regulatory authorities, commenced audits in our Sacramento center in California and in all our centers in Colorado. Based on deficiencies detected in the audits related to participant provision of services, which can be categorized as care delivery and management, care coordination and documentation of care, CMS and regulatory authorities in the states of California and Colorado suspended new enrollments at our Sacramento center in California and all our centers in Colorado. The suspensions will remain in effect until CMS and the other regulatory authorities determine that we have remediated the deficiencies to their satisfaction. In November 2021 and March 2022, CMS began audits of our Albuquerque, New Mexico center and San Bernardino, California center, respectively. CMS issued preliminary results in both audits identifying certain deficiencies, but in both cases have verbally notified us that no enforcement actions will be taken. To address the deficiencies identified in the audit processes, we are required to implement immediate corrective actions. Our plans to do so (“iCARs”) have been accepted by CMS and we are currently working on the audit close out process for these two audits. There can be no assurance as to the timelines of such close outs. 
In addition, the States of Kentucky and Indiana have taken actions to suspend our ability to open de novo centers in those states, and we have committed to regulatory agencies in the State of Florida, that we will proactively pause remaining steps with respect to planned de novo centers in that state. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Risks Related to Our Business—We face inspections, reviews, audits and investigations under federal and state government programs 

6



and contracts. These audits require corrective actions and have resulted in adverse findings that have negatively affected and continue to affect our business, including our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and reputation.”
The Company’s priority is to remediate the deficiencies raised in the audit processes and to return to growth as a company, both for the short- and long-term. We continue to work with the appropriate authorities to make the necessary changes within the Company to increase care coordination and care documentation among our centers. As part of this focus, we are working to fill critical personnel gaps at our centers. We recently hired a Chief People Officer to help provide assistance and oversight of current employee engagement and personnel hiring. Other key remediation initiatives include standardizing the process of our IDTs, strengthening our home care network and reliability, improving timeliness of scheduling and coordinating care with providers outside the centers, improving our telephonic channel response times, improving the efficiency and reliability of transportation for our participants, standardizing our wound care program across the enterprise and reducing documentation outside the electronic medical record. True to our mission, which seeks to provide quality care to our participants so that they can live in their homes and communities for as long as possible, we continue to work to enhance our practices and implement measures adopted in our centers under audit throughout all our centers, not only to satisfy federal and state government agencies’ concerns, but most importantly to enhance the quality of care we provide to our participants.
Our Value Proposition 
We believe that our healthcare model is one where all constituencies involved, including participants, their families, providers and government payors, have the ability to “Win.” 
Our participants “Win” by enjoying a better participant experience, improved health outcomes and remaining in their homes and communities for longer. We leverage our differentiated care delivery model to improve the health of our participants and help them avoid unnecessary hospitalizations and nursing home care. We enable our participants to remain in their homes and age independently. As a result, as of June 30 2022, over 90% of our participants lived in their preferred setting: their home or community. We believe our care model also delivers better clinical outcomes: our participants have fewer hospital admissions, fewer low- to medium-severity emergency room visits and lower 30-day hospital readmission rates. Our care model is not “one size fits all,” it is customized to the unique needs of each participant, which benefits participant health and increases participant satisfaction with our program.
Families “Win” as we reduce their caregiving burden and provide “peace of mind”. We significantly reduce the caregiving burden on the families of our participants. Our model handles all transportation to and from medical appointments and center visits, helps participants with ADLs, and creates social outlets for participants to reduce isolation. Most importantly, we believe we offer “peace of mind” to our participants’ families who know their loved one’s complex needs are cared for. “Friends and family” of participants remain one of our largest referral sources for recruiting new participants.
Our providers “Win” as they are able to focus on improving the lives of their participants. We enable our providers to focus on taking care of participants by providing them with meaningful clinical and administrative support. We remove the pressure of trying to optimize visit volume by rewarding quality, not quantity, of care. We estimate that our providers (1) have a smaller number of participants to care for and spend more time with each participant than providers in similar care organizations, and (2) benefit from the support of a multidisciplinary team.
Government payors “Win” through fiscal certainty and lower costs. We believe we provide fiscal certainty through our capitated payment arrangements and reduce the cost of both medical and long-term support and services for high-cost, dual-eligible seniors. Costs under the PACE program were estimated to be 13% lower on average than for a comparable dual-eligible population aged 65 and older under Medicaid, based on an analysis of available data by the National PACE Association in November 2020.
Our Growth Strategy 
Increase participant enrollment and capacity within existing centers

● | For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, our participant census was approximately 6,650 across our 18 centers in five states. Once restrictions on our ability to enroll participants as a result of the audits of our centers in

Sacramento, California and Colorado and on our ability to open de novo centers as a result of actions taken by other states or us, are lifted or resolved, we expect to strengthen our efforts to grow our census.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Build de novo centers


● | We believe de novo centers generate compelling long-term unit economics and the potential for robust internal rates of return.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have operated our platform across different geographies and, once restrictions on our ability to enroll participants as a result of the audits of our centers in Sacramento, California and Colorado and on our ability to open de novo centers as a result of actions taken by other states or us, are lifted or resolved, we expect to prioritize a list of target markets that we believe are optimal environments to launch the InnovAge Platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our approach to de novo developments is expected to include building centers to our experience-based specifications, with flexibility for future center expansion factored into the blueprints where possible.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Execute tuck-in acquisitions

● | From fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year 2021, we have acquired and integrated three PACE organizations, expanding into one new state and four new markets through those acquisitions. By bringing acquired organizations under the InnovAge Platform, we hope to further realize revenue growth and improve operational efficiency and care delivery post-integration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Once restrictions on our ability to enroll participants as a result of the audits of our centers in Sacramento, California and Colorado and on our ability to open de novo centers as a result of actions taken by other states or us, are lifted or resolved, we believe there is a robust landscape of potential tuck-in acquisitions to supplement our organic growth and that our history of integrating business will help increase efficiencies during the integration process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Reinvest in the InnovAge Platform to optimize performance

● | We believe that our ongoing investment in the InnovAge Platform drives greater efficiency across our business, creating a virtuous cycle that allows us to continue providing necessary care to our participants. Our platform is the largest among PACE providers based on participants served and one of the most geographically diverse.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We plan to continually invest in technology improvements and seek to unlock new insights through enhanced data analytics capabilities that will advance our care model.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We believe our investments will ultimately result in better health outcomes and lower medical costs for participants. As we continue to reduce medical costs, we expect to generate incremental savings that can be reinvested to support continuous improvement of the InnovAge Platform.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Regulation
Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, arrangement and provision of covered health care services to our participants, operation and management of PACE centers, dispensing of pharmaceuticals, personnel qualifications, maintenance of proper records, and quality assurance programs. If any of our operations are found to violate applicable laws or regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price, including:
​

● | suspension, termination or exclusion of our participation in government payor programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​loss of our licenses required to operate healthcare facilities or administer prescription drugs in the states in which we operate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal or civil liability, fines, damages or monetary penalties for violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the False Claims Act (“FCA”) and/or state analogs to these federal enforcement authorities, or other regulatory requirements;

​
We expect that our industry will continue to be subject to substantial regulation, the scope and effect of which are difficult to predict. Our activities could be subject to investigations, audits and inquiries by various government and regulatory agencies with whom we contract at any time in the future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “​Risks Related to Regulation.”
Federal and State Regulation of PACE Providers
We are subject to a complex array of federal and state laws, regulations, and guidance, including legal requirements directly applicable to PACE providers as well as Medicare and Medicaid laws and regulations. These laws and guidance relate to our organizational structure, governance, fiscal soundness, marketing activities, participant enrollment and disenrollment, charges to participants, provision of healthcare and other services to participants, care planning activities, service delivery settings and maintenance of centers, participant rights, employment and contractual arrangements with health care providers and other staff, quality assessment and performance improvement activities, participant grievances and appeals, medical records documentation, compliance program activities, and other aspects of our operations and financing. As a PACE provider that provides qualified prescription drug coverage, we are also subject to requirements applicable to Medicare Part D plan sponsors.
​
As a PACE provider, we and our centers are subject to audits by CMS and state agencies, which have in the past and may in the future result in the identification of deficiencies in connection with our compliance with regulatory requirements, participant quality of care, care plan development and implementation, grievance and appeal processes, clinicians acting outside of their scope of practice, and other issues. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “​Risks Related to Regulation” for a description of current audits in the States of California, Colorado, and New Mexico and their results. We expect these audits to continue in the future. In addition to risks associated with audits of our current centers, we also face risks associated with new centers that we may acquire in the future, which may not have developed the same compliance and quality infrastructure that we currently have in place or are in the process of implementing. Issues identified through these audits have and may in the future result in corrective action plans, civil monetary penalties, enrollment suspensions, and other financial penalties and enforcement actions, in addition to loss of our contracts with CMS and state agencies.
​
The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to PACE providers are complex and subject to change, making it necessary for us to invest significant resources in complying with these requirements. Scrutiny through federal and state government audits, oversight and enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources. CMS and state regulatory authorities regularly 

9



audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS’s regulations and our contracts with CMS and to assess the quality of the services we provide to our participants. Whether identified through these audits or other avenues, our failure to comply with the federal and state laws applicable to our business have and may continue to result in significant or material retroactive adjustments to and/or withholding of capitation payments, fines, criminal liability, civil monetary penalties, requirements to make significant changes to our operations, CMS imposed sanctions (including suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs), loss of contracts, or cessation of our services.
​
Licensing Laws
We, our healthcare professionals, and our centers are subject to various state and local licensure and certification requirements in connection with our provision of health care and other services. Specifically, in some of the states in which we operate, we are required to maintain licensure or certification as an adult day health center, home health or home care provider, diagnostic and treatment center, pharmacy provider, clinical laboratory and/or other type of facility, and our employed physicians and other clinicians also must be licensed or certified, as applicable, in the states in which they are providing services. We, our healthcare professionals and our centers are also subject to a variety of other state laws and regulations, relating to, among other things, the quality of medical care, equipment, privacy of health information, physician relationships, personnel and operating policies and procedures. In addition to state requirements, we and/or our healthcare professionals are in some cases subject to federal licensing and certification requirements, such as certification or waiver under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 for performing limited laboratory testing and Drug Enforcement Administration registration for writing prescriptions for controlled substances. In addition, certain of the states where we currently operate or may choose to operate in the future regulate the operations and financial condition of risk bearing providers. These regulations can include capital requirements, licensing or certification, governance controls and other similar matters. While the states in which we operate do not currently impose these regulations on entities solely bearing risk under the PACE program, these states or states that we expand into may in the future seek to license or otherwise regulate our operations and financial solvency.
​
Failure to comply with federal, state and local licensing and certification laws, regulations and standards could result in a variety of consequences, including cessation of our services, loss of our contracts, prior payments by payors being subject to recoupment, requirements to make significant changes to our operations, or civil or criminal penalties. We routinely take the steps we believe are necessary to retain or obtain all requisite licensure and operating authorities. While we endeavor to comply with federal, state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations and standards as we interpret them, the laws and regulations in these areas are complex, changing and often subject to varying interpretations. For example, in Pennsylvania, the statutes that pertain to the employment of health care practitioners by health care facilities do not explicitly include a PACE organization in the list of health care facilities by which a health care practitioner may be employed. Any failure to satisfy applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.
​
Corporate Practice of Medicine
​
The laws and regulations relating to our operations vary from state to state, and some states in which we operate prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting professional fees with physicians. In certain states, we currently contract with physicians to provide healthcare services that are required to be provided by licensed physicians. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine, other parties may assert that we could be engaged in the corporate practice of medicine. Further, many such state laws are often vague or have otherwise only been infrequently interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies. Were allegations to be asserted successfully before the appropriate judicial or administrative forums, we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative penalties, certain contracts could be determined to be unenforceable and we may be required to restructure our contractual arrangements.

The consequences associated with violating corporate practice of medicine laws vary by state and may result in physicians being subject to disciplinary action, as well as forfeiture of revenues from government payors for services rendered. For lay entities, violations may also bring both civil and, in more extreme cases, criminal liability for engaging in medical practice without a license. Some of the relevant laws, regulations and agency interpretations in states with corporate practice of medicine restrictions have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. In limited 

10



cases, courts have required companies to divest or reorganize structures deemed to violate corporate practice restrictions. Moreover, state laws are subject to change. Any allegations or findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician could be considered void and unenforceable if in violation of such state laws.
​
See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Risks Related to Our Business—Laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which we are permitted to conduct our business, and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to penalties or require a restructuring of our business.”
​
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
​
Federal criminal penalties for the violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment, fines and exclusion of the provider from future participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per kickback or both. Larger fines can be imposed upon corporations under the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the Alternate Fines Statute. Individuals and entities convicted of violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are subject to mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years in the case of criminal conviction. Civil penalties for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute include up to $112,131 in monetary penalties per violation, repayments of up to three times the total payments between the parties to the arrangement and potential exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Court decisions have held that the statute may be violated even if only one purpose of remuneration is to induce referrals. The Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to clarify the intent that is required to prove a violation. Under the statute as amended, the defendant does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or have the specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that any claims for items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are considered false or fraudulent for purposes of the FCA.
​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. These exceptions and safe harbors are voluntary. Business transactions and arrangements that are structured to comply fully with an applicable safe harbor do not violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. However, transactions and arrangements that do not satisfy all elements of a relevant safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law. When an arrangement does not satisfy a safe harbor, the arrangement must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in light of the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse. Arrangements that do not satisfy a safe harbor may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
​
We enter into several arrangements that could potentially implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute if the requisite intent were present, such as:
​

● | Joint Ventures. To prove the concept of our ability to work with not-for-profits, we operate one of our centers under a joint venture with a not-for-profit healthcare provider. Although we do not expressly seek to enter into new joint ventures, it is possible that the government payor landscape in certain markets we may attempt to enter in the future may make entering into additional joint ventures attractive. Investment interests in the joint venture may not fully satisfy a safe harbor. The Office of Inspector General (the “OIG”) of HHS has warned health care entities in the past that certain joint venture relationships have a potential for abuse. We have endeavored to structure our joint venture to satisfy as many elements of the applicable safe harbor for investments in small entities as we believe are commercially reasonable. For example, we believe that these investments are offered and made by us on a fair market value basis and provide returns to the investors in proportion to their actual investment in the venture. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11




● | Discounts. Our centers sometimes acquire certain items and services at a discount that may be reimbursed by a federal healthcare program. We endeavor to structure our vendor contracts that include discount or rebate provisions to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for discounts. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sales Forces and Participant Recruitment. We employ our own sales force and attempt to meet the Anti-Kickback safe harbor for bona fide employment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
​If any of our business transactions or arrangements, including those described above, were found to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, we could face, among other things, criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal healthcare programs and FCA liability. Any findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price. In addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, various states in which we operate have adopted their own anti-kickback statutes.
​
As part of HHS’s Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care, OIG issued a request for information in August 2018 seeking input on regulatory provisions that may act as barriers to coordinated care or value-based care. Specifically, OIG sought to identify ways in which it might modify or add new safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute (as well as exceptions to the definition of “remuneration” in the beneficiary inducements provision of the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute) in order to foster arrangements that promote care coordination and advance the delivery of value-based care, while also protecting against harms caused by fraud and abuse. OIG issued final rules effective January 19, 2021, that modify existing safe harbors and create new safe harbors and exceptions that may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
​
Federal Self-Referral Prohibition
The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act (“Stark Law”) generally prohibits a physician who has (or whose immediate family member has) a financial relationship with a provider from making referrals to that “entity” for “designated health services” if payment for the services may be made under Medicare or Medicaid. “Designated health services” include clinical laboratory services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physical and occupational therapy services, outpatient speech-language pathology services, certain radiology services, radiation therapy services and supplies, durable medical equipment and supplies, parenteral and enteral nutrients equipment and supplies, prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies, home health services and outpatient prescription drugs. If our operations ever result in us being included within the definition of an “entity” under the Stark Law, then any financial relationships that we have with a referring provider would be prohibited unless a statutory or regulatory exception is available.
​
Providers are prohibited from filing Medicare claims for services related to a prohibited referral and a provider that has billed for prohibited services is obligated to notify and refund the amounts collected from the Medicare program or to make a self-disclosure to CMS under its Self-Referral Disclosure Protocol. Penalties for violation of the Stark Law include denial of payment, recoupment, refunds of amounts paid in violation of the law, exclusion from the Medicare or Medicaid programs, and substantial civil monetary penalties ($27,750 per prohibited item or service and $185,009 if there is a circumvention scheme; penalty amounts reflect current 2021 levels and are adjusted for inflation from time to time). Claims filed in violation of the Stark Law may be deemed false claims under the FCA. In addition to the Stark Law, various states in which we operate have adopted their own self-referral prohibition statutes.
​
The False Claims Act
​
Among other things, the FCA authorizes the imposition of up to three times the government’s damages and significant per claim civil penalties on any “person” (including an individual, organization or company) who, among other acts:
​

● | knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the federal government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12




● | knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record, report or statement material to an obligation to pay the government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | conspires to commit the above acts.
--+------------------------------------

​
The federal government has used the FCA to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs, including but not limited to coding errors, billing for services not rendered, the submission of false cost or other reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing under a comprehensive code as well as under one or more component codes included in the comprehensive code, billing for care that is not considered medically necessary and false reporting of risk-adjusted diagnostic codes, encounter data or other information used to determine capitated payments. The ACA provides that claims for payment that are tainted by a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (which could include, for example, illegal incentives or remuneration in exchange for enrollment or referrals) are false for purposes of the FCA. In addition, amendments to the FCA and Social Security Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments from government payors. This could be relevant to the extent we received payments on account of RAF determinations that are based on improper or erroneous records or reports. Failure to return overpayments could subject us to liability under the FCA, exclusion from government healthcare programs and penalties under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute.
​
The penalties for a violation of the FCA may include per claim penalties, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim. The Department of Justice has adjusted the per claim penalty range from $12,537 to $25,076 for penalties assessed after May 9, 2022, if the underlying conduct occurred after November 2, 2015.
 
In addition to civil enforcement under the FCA, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. Any allegations or findings that we have violated the FCA could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
In addition to the FCA, the various states in which we operate have adopted their own analogs of the FCA. States are becoming increasingly active in using their false claims laws to police the same activities listed above, particularly with regard to capitated government-sponsored healthcare programs, such as Medicaid managed care and PACE. For additional information regarding allegations against us under Federal and State FCA statutes, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to legal proceedings, enforcement actions and litigation, malpractice and privacy disputes, which are costly to defend and could materially harm our business and results of operations.”
​
Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
​
The Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a, authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to:
​

● | presenting, or causing to be presented, claims, reports or records relating to payment by Medicare, Medicaid or other government payors that the individual or entity knows or should know are for an item or service that was not provided as reported, is false or fraudulent or was presented for a physician’s service by a person who knows or should know that the individual providing the service is not a licensed physician, obtained licensure through misrepresentation or represented certification in a medical specialty without in fact possessing such certification;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | offering remuneration to a federal health care program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive health care items or services from a particular provider;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | arranging contracts with or making payments to an entity or individual excluded from participation in the federal health care programs or included on CMS’s preclusion list;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | ​making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a federal health care program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13




● | ​making, using or causing to be made any false statement, omission or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of services or a supplier under a federal health care program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​failing to report and return an overpayment owed to the federal government.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We could be exposed to a wide range of allegations to which the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute would apply. We perform monthly checks on our employees and certain affiliates and vendors using government databases to confirm that these individuals have not been excluded from federal programs or otherwise ineligible for payment. We have also implemented processes to ensure that we do not make payments to contracted or noncontracted providers listed on CMS’s preclusion list nor make payments for drugs prescribed by individuals on the preclusion list. However, should an individual or entity be excluded, on the preclusion list, or otherwise ineligible for payment and we fail to detect it, a federal agency could require us to refund amounts attributable to all claims or services performed or sufficiently linked to such individual or entity. Due to this area of risk and the possibility of other allegations being brought against us, we cannot foreclose the possibility that we could face allegations of noncompliance with the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute that have the potential for a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
Privacy and Security
​
The federal regulations promulgated under the authority of HIPAA require us to provide certain protections to our participants and their health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of PHI and require covered entities, which include healthcare providers and their business associates, to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security requirements apply to electronic PHI. These regulations also provide our participants with substantive rights with respect to their health information.
​
The HIPAA privacy and security regulations also require us to enter into written agreements with certain contractors, known as business associates, to whom we disclose PHI. A business associate is any person or entity (other than members of a covered entity’s workforce) that performs a service for or on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information. Covered entities may be subject to penalties for, among other activities, failing to enter into a business associate agreement where required by law or as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity and acting within the scope of the agency. Business associates are also directly subject to liability under certain HIPAA privacy and security regulations. In instances where we act as a business associate to a covered entity, there is the potential for additional liability beyond our status as a covered entity.
​
Covered entities must notify affected individuals of breaches of unsecured PHI without unreasonable delay but no later than 60 days after discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Reporting must also be made to the HHS Office for Civil Rights and, for breaches of unsecured PHI involving more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, to the media. All impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless an exception to the definition of breach applies or the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the PHI has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving personal information without regard to the probability of the information being compromised.
​
Violations of HIPAA by providers like us, including, but not limited to, failing to implement appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, have resulted in enforcement actions and in some cases triggered settlement payments or civil monetary penalties. Penalties for impermissible use or disclosure of PHI were increased by the HITECH Act by imposing tiered penalties of more than $50,000 (not adjusted for inflation) per violation and up to approximately $1.9 million (not adjusted for inflation) per year for identical violations. In addition, HIPAA provides for criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison, with the severest penalties for obtaining and disclosing PHI with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. There can be no assurance that we will not be the subject of an investigation (arising out of a reportable breach incident, audit or otherwise) alleging non-compliance with HIPAA regulations in our maintenance of PHI.

14



​
In addition to HIPAA, we may be subject to other laws governing the privacy and security of data, such as the CCPA and data breach notification laws.
​
Healthcare Reform Efforts
​
The U.S. federal and state governments continue to enact and seriously consider many broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that have had a material impact on or could materially impact various aspects of the healthcare system and our business, operating results and/or cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary shortfalls and constraints pose potential risks for our revenue streams. We cannot predict how government payors or healthcare consumers might react to federal and state healthcare legislation and regulation, whether already enacted or enacted in the future, nor can we predict what form such legislation or regulations will take. Some examples of legislative and regulatory changes impacting our business include:
​

● | In March 2010, broad healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States through the ACA. There have since been numerous political and legal efforts to repeal, replace or modify the ACA, some of which have been successful, in part, in modifying the law. Although some provisions of the ACA have been and may be modified, the reforms could continue to have an impact on our business in a number of ways. Provisions of the ACA that impact the Medicare and Medicaid programs, in particular, may have an impact on our business. These and other provisions of the ACA remain subject to ongoing uncertainty due to developing regulations as well as continuing political and legal challenges at both the federal and state levels.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | There have in recent years been congressional efforts to move Medicaid from an open-ended program with coverage and benefits set by the federal government to one in which states receive a fixed amount of federal funds, either through block grants or per capita caps, and have more flexibility to determine benefits, eligibility or provider payments. If these types of changes are implemented in the future, we cannot predict whether the amount of fixed federal funding to the states will be based on current payment amounts, or if it will be based on lower payment amounts, which would negatively impact those states that expanded their Medicaid programs in response to the ACA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Legislation enacted in 2011 requires CMS to sequester or reduce all Medicare payments, including payments to PACE organizations, by two percent per year for a period of years. Subsequent legislation extended these cuts through 2031, but legislation enacted in 2020 suspended the cuts during the pandemic. On December 10, 2021 the “Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act” extended the 2% Medicare sequester moratorium through March 31, 2022, and adjusted the sequester to 1% between April 1, 2022 and June 30, 2022. These cuts were reinstated on July 1, 2022 and will negatively impact our revenue. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes a number of provisions intended to lower the costs of some drugs covered under Medicare Part D and to limit Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket spending under the Medicare Part D benefit. It is not yet clear what effect, if any, these legislative changes and any subsequent implementing regulations and guidance will have on our business.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
While there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future, the specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent. Specifically, changes in Medicare and Medicaid could lower PACE rates or increase our expenses. Any failure to successfully implement strategic initiatives that respond to future legislative, regulatory, and executive changes could have a material adverse effect on government-sponsored PACE programs, our business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
CMS and state Medicaid agencies also routinely adjust the RAF which is central to payment under PACE and Managed Medicaid programs in which we participate. The monetary “coefficient” values associated with diseases that we manage in our population are subject to change by CMS and state agencies. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Risks Related to Our Business — Our records and submissions to government payors may contain inaccurate or unsupportable information regarding risk adjustment scores of participants, which could cause us to overstate or understate our revenue and subject us to payment obligations or penalties.”
​

Other Regulations
Our operations are subject to various state hazardous waste and non-hazardous medical waste disposal laws. These laws do not classify as hazardous most of the waste produced from medical services. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations require employers to provide workers who are occupationally subject to blood or other potentially infectious materials with prescribed protections. These regulatory requirements apply to all healthcare facilities, including our community centers, and require employers to make a determination as to which employees may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials and to have in effect a written exposure control plan. In addition, employers are required to provide or employ hepatitis B vaccinations, personal protective equipment and other safety devices, infection control training, post-exposure evaluation and follow-up, waste disposal techniques and procedures and work practice controls. Employers are also required to comply with various record-keeping requirements.

Federal and state law also governs the dispensing of controlled substances by physicians. For example, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act governs the distribution of drug samples. Physicians are required to report relationships they have with the manufacturers of drugs, medical devices and biologics through the Open Payments Program database. Any allegations or findings that we or our providers have violated any of these laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Certain states in which we do business or may desire to do business in the future have certificate of need programs regulating the establishment or expansion of healthcare facilities, including our community centers. These regulations can be complex and time-consuming to ensure compliance with. Any failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
Impact of COVID-19 and Macroeconomic Conditions
The COVID-19 pandemic altered the behavior of businesses and people, the effects of which continue on federal, state and local economies. 
Expenses. The virus has and continues to disproportionately impact older adults, especially those with chronic illnesses, which describes our participants. The United States continues to experience supply chain issues with respect to personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and other medical supplies used to prevent transmission of COVID-19. During the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, we acquired significantly greater quantities of medical supplies at significantly higher prices than pre-pandemic rates to ensure the safety of our employees and our participants. Costs related to PPE medical supplies represented approximately 0.6% and 0.6% of our total cost of care for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These costs did not have a material effect on our business or expenses. 
Labor market. The COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to exacerbate difficulties to hire additional healthcare professionals, causing certain of our centers to be understaffed or staffed with personnel that requires training. The labor shortage has also contributed to the increased wage pressure to retain and attract such healthcare professionals. The combination of increased wage pressure and labor shortage amongst healthcare personnel, and specifically, trained personnel, has impacted and may continue to impact our expenses and ability to adhere to the complex government laws and regulations that apply to our business. 
Additionally, geopolitical events have contributed to adverse macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to inflation, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal monetary policy, higher interest rates, potential global security issues and market volatility. None of these factors have had a material effect on our operations to date.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property

Competition
The U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive. We compete directly with national, regional and local providers of healthcare for participants and clinical providers. We also compete with payors and other alternate managed care

programs for participants. Of these providers, there are many other companies and individuals currently providing healthcare services, many of which have been in business longer and/or have substantially more resources. Given the regulatory environment, there may be high barriers to entry for PACE providers; however, since there are relatively modest capital expenditures required for providing healthcare services, there are less substantial financial barriers to entry in the healthcare industry generally. Other companies could enter the healthcare industry in the future and divert some or all of our business. Our principal competitors for dual-eligible seniors vary considerably in type and identity by market. Sanctions imposed on our Sacramento, California center and our Colorado centers have adversely affected and may continue to affect our ability to grow our business and recruit qualified physicians and could cause participant attrition to our competitors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The healthcare industry is highly competitive and, if we are not able to compete effectively, our business could be harmed.”
We believe the principal competitive factors for serving adults dually-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and who meet nursing home eligibility criteria include: participant experience, quality of care, health outcomes, total cost of care, brand identity and trust in that brand.
Seasonality
Our business experiences some variability depending upon the time of year. Medical costs will vary seasonally depending on a number of factors, but most significantly the weather. Certain illnesses, such as the influenza virus and possibly COVID-19, are far more prevalent during colder months of the year, which will result in an increase in medical expenses during these time periods. We would therefore expect to see higher levels of per-participant medical costs in our second and third quarters. Medical costs also depend upon the number of business days in a period, and shorter periods will have lower medical costs. Business days can also create year-over-year comparability issues if a period in one year has a different number of business days compared to the same period in another. 
In addition, the retrospective capitation payments we receive for each participant are determined by a participant’s RAF score, which is calculated twice per year and is based on the evolving acuity and chronic conditions of a participant. We estimate and accrue for the expected true-up payments of our participants. Though no assurances can be made in the future, we have historically used our best estimate for accruing for this payment, and we received net positive true-up payments during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Historically, these true-up payments typically occur between May and August, but the timing of these payments is determined by CMS, and we have neither visibility nor control over the timing of such payments.
Human Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 2,000 employees, including 1,300 clinical professionals (excluding contract labor). We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are unionized or party to a collective bargaining agreement.
Our people are our product at InnovAge, and their commitment to our participants propels our mission of enabling seniors to age at home, with dignity, for as long as is safely possible.  We believe that our employees are drawn to this mission and our values, which is why our voluntary retention rate was 63.6% over fiscal year 2022.  Additionally, in our most recent employee engagement survey conducted in April 2022, 73% of our employees indicated that they feel engaged by their work at InnovAge.
Attracting and retaining top talent is critical to the success of InnovAge's mission and one of the highest priorities to leadership.  To keep leadership informed of the health of our employee base, we report weekly on key hiring and retention metrics.  We launched employee engagement surveys in fiscal year 2022, and we are implementing action plans with all staff groups based on survey findings and opportunities uncovered.  We intend to monitor progress by releasing multiple engagement surveys annually. 
We have recently added proven, experienced leaders at the executive level, including our new Chief Executive Officer and President, Patrick Blair, and our new Chief Medical Officer, Chief People Officer, and Chief Business Development Officer.  We continue to evaluate talent needs at the senior management level, aiming to hire ahead of the curve as the business evolves and to assess and respond to any gaps in our capabilities.

Diversity
At InnovAge, we strive to be a reflection of the diverse communities that we serve.  We are committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion across all teams at InnovAge and we believe in creating an environment where individual differences are respected and embraced.  In our most recent engagement survey conducted in April 2022, 79.2% of employees indicated that they feel that they can be their authentic selves at work.
As of June 30, 2022, our employed workforce was comprised of individuals who identified as women – 76%, and minorities – 40.3%.  Six of nine members of our executive leadership team identify as women.
Training and Development
We aim to provide our employees opportunities to grow and advance in their careers at InnovAge with learning and development programs.  Each year we conduct soft skills training for managers and supervisors, the content of which is informed by gap assessment surveys.   A quarterly training series for front-line leaders enables them to develop their management skills.  Our clinical leaders also conduct separate physician leadership trainings quarterly, with a new topic for each installment (e.g., email / phone etiquette). 
We also launched a training needs assessment survey in August 2020 to hear directly from employees and managers where they think they could use more support and learning content in the coming year. As a result of these assessment surveys, the Company has developed trainings tailored to the most prevalent needs identified by our employees.
Implications of being an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) June 30, 2026, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. Additionally, we qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” and even after we no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company,” we may still qualify as a “smaller reporting company” based on the aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates assessed on an annual basis and measured as of the last business day of the issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter. 
As an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

● | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a requirement to present only two years of audited financial statements, plus unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for any interim period and related discussion in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under the JOBS Act until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Our election to use the phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the longer phase-in periods permitted under the JOBS Act and who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to the JOBS Act.
