Our Company
 
We strive to be one of America’s great meat processors  and a leading foodservice distributor in the Southwest. Built through organic growth and acquisitions, we trace our roots back over 30 years to a number of heritage companies with long legacies  in food innovation and customer service.
 
We strive to inspire and empower chefs and foodservice operators to bring great food experiences to consumers. This mission is supported by our strategy of Best Foods at Best Prices which is centered on providing customers with the innovative products business support they need to operate their businesses profitably.
 
We supply approximately 400 customer locations in the Southwest . These customer locations include independently owned single and multi-unit restaurants, regional restaurant chains, hospitals, nursing homes, hotels and motels, country clubs, government and military organizations, colleges and universities, and retail locations. We provide more than 3,000 fresh, frozen, and dry food stock-keeping units, or SKUs, as well as non-food items, sourced from multiple suppliers. Our sales associates manage customer relationships at local and regional levels. Our distribution facilities and fleet of approximately 15 trucks allow us to operate efficiently and provide high levels of customer service.
 
Our Industry
 
America’s food distribution industry has a large number of companies competing in the space, including local, regional, and national foodservice distributors. Foodservice distributors typically fall into three categories, representing differences in customer focus, product offering, and supply chain:

● | Broadline distributors which offer a “broad line” of products and services; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | System distributors which carry products specified for large chains; and 
● | Specialized distributors which primarily focus on specific product categories (e.g., meat or produce) or customer types. 

 
Given our mix of products and services, we are considered a broadline distributor. A number of adjacent competitors also serve the food distribution industry, including cash-and-carry retailers, commercial wholesale outlets, commercial website outlets, and grocery stores. Customer buying decisions are based on the assortment of product offered, quality, price, and service levels.
 
There are several important dynamics affecting the industry, including:
 

● | Evolving consumer tastes and preferences. Consumers demand healthy and authentic food choices with fewer artificial ingredients, and they value locally-harvested and sustainably-manufactured food and packaging products. In addition, many ethnic food offerings are becoming more mainstream as consumers show a greater willingness to try new flavors and cuisines. Changes in consumer preferences create opportunities for new and innovative products and for unique food away from home destinations. This, in turn, is expected to create growth, expand margins, and produce better customer retention opportunities for those distributors with the flexibility to balance national scale and local preferences.

● | Generational shifts with millennials and baby boomers. Given their purchasing power and diverse taste profiles, millennials, Generation Z and baby boomers will continue to significantly influence food consumption and the food away from home market. According to recent U.S. Census Bureau statistics, there were 89 million individuals born between 1982 and 2002 in the U.S., making millennials and Generation Z the largest demographic cohorts . When it comes to food, millennials and Generation Z are open-minded and curious, and willing to seek out new flavors, dining experiences and diverse menu offerings, while also demanding customization, convenience and sustainable products. Independent restaurants are well positioned to capitalize on these preferences. As millennials’ and Generation Z’s disposable income increases, we believe this demographic will be key to driving growth in the broader U.S. food industry. We also expect that baby boomers will continue to shape the industry as they remain in the workplace longer, which is expected to prolong their contribution to food away from home expenditures.

Corporate History
 
Pacific Ventures was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 3, 1986, under the name AOA Corporation. On November 12, 1991, the Company changed its name to American Eagle Group, Inc. On October 22, 2012, the Company changed its name to Pacific Ventures Group, Inc.
 
The current structure of Pacific Ventures resulted from a share exchange with Snöbar Holdings, Inc. (“Snöbar”), which was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposes. On August 14, 2015, Pacific Ventures and its stockholders entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Snöbar Holdings, Inc. (“Snöbar Holdings”), pursuant to which Pacific Ventures acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Snöbar Holdings’ Class A and Class B common stock in exchange for 22,500,000 restricted shares of Pacific Ventures’ common stock, while simultaneously issuing 2,500,000 shares of Pacific Ventures’ restricted common stock to certain other persons, including for services provided and to a former officer of the Company (the “Share Exchange”).As the result of the Share Exchange, Snöbar Holdings. became Pacific Venture’s wholly owned operating subsidiary and the business of Snöbar Holdings became the Company’s sole business operations, and Snöbar Holdings’ majority owned subsidiary, MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation (“MGD”), became indirect subsidiary of Pacific Ventures.
 
Prior to the Share Exchange, the Company operated as an insurance holding company and through its subsidiaries, marketed and underwrote specialized property and casualty coverage in the general aviation insurance marketplace. However, in 1997, after selling several of its divisions, the Company’s remaining insurance operations were placed into receivership and the Company ceased operating its insurance business.
 
Since the Share Exchange represented a change in control of the Company and a change in business operations, the business operations changed to the Food and Beverage industry and the discussions of business operations accompanying this filing are that of Royalty Foods Partner LLC, DBA San Diego Farmers Outlet and Seaport Group Enterprises LLC, DBA Seaport Meat Company.
 
Snöbar Holdings was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7, 2013. Snöbar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary of Snöbar Trust, a California trust (“Trust”), which was formed in June 1, 2013. The current trustee that holds legal title to the Trust is Azita Davidiyan. The Trust owns 100% of the shares of International Production Impex Corporation, a California corporation (“IPIC”), which was formed on August 2, 2001. IPIC is in the business of selling alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops and holds all of the rights to the liquor licenses to sell such products and trade names “SnöBar”. As such, the Trust holds all ownership interest of IPIC and its liquor licenses, permitting IPIC to sell its product to distributors, with all income, expense, gains and losses rolling up to the Trust, of which Snöbar Holdings is the sole beneficiary. Snöbar Holdings also owns 99.9% of the shares of MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation (“MGD”).

The Trust and IPIC are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and Snöbar Holdings is identified as the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification(“ASC”) 810, Snöbar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. As the assessment of Snöbar Holdings’ management is that Snöbar Holdings has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC), and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE’s economic performance, it was therefore concluded by management that Snöbar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such, the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the financial statements of Snöbar Holdings since the inception of the Trust, in the case of the Trust, and since the inception of Snöbar Holdings, in the case of IPIC.
 
On May 1, 2018, Royalty Foods Partners, LLC – a Florida Limited Liability Corporation and a subsidiary of Pacific Ventures Group, Inc. – acquired 100% of the assests of San Diego Farmers Outlet, Inc. (SDFO), a California Corporation. San Diego Farmers Outlet was started in over thirty-five years ago to provide primarily restaurants customers in southern California’s three largest counties with quality food, produce, and dairy and does business under the names of Farmers Outlet and San Diego Farmers Outlet.
 
On August 20, 2019, Seaport Group Enterprises, LLC— a California Limited Liability Corporation was formed, and it is a subsidiary of Pacific Ventures Group, Inc.
 
On December 17, 2019, Seaport Group Enterprise LLC, acquired 100% of the assets of PNC Inc. (the “Seller”) DBA Seaport Meat Company. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement as Amended.
 
The assets acquired consist of assets and rights that belong to the Seaport Meat Company that are used in or pertain to the business and all necessary to operating the business as its currently being operated.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 117 West 9th Street, Suite 316, Los Angeles, California. Our main telephone number is (310) 392-5606.
