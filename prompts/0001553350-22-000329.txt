ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company History
 
Energy and Water Development Corp. (the “Company” or “EAWD”) was registered as a Florida corporation under the name Eagle International Holdings Group Inc. on December 12, 2007 and, on March 10, 2008, the Company changed its name to Eurosport Active World Corporation. 
 
On March 17, 2008, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Acquisition (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with Inko Sport America, LLC (“ISA”), a privately-held Florida limited liability company. In connection with the closing of the Acquisition Agreement, the Company adopted ISA’s business plan and the Company’s current officers and directors were elected to their positions. This transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein ISA was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. ISA was administratively dissolved in September 2010.
 
In September 2019, the Company changed its name to Energy and Water Development Corp. to better present the Company’s purpose and business sector. 
 
On November 9, 2021, the Company established an official Subsidiary of EAWD in Germany to ensure the company is positioned to service its growing business in one of the EU’s most environmentally progressive countries.

The green tech industry is constantly evolving due to ongoing and increasing water scarcity as well as increased energy need in the world. Therefore, we believe that by designing the most sustainable renewable solutions to these problems, EAWD will become an essential component of a rapidly growing industry with many new markets. The green tech industry is complex because it still requires much promotion and information about its potential. Furthermore, regulations in each country are different and, in many cases, several segments are regulated by both national and local (state, provincial, municipal) governments. EAWD’s approach seeks to assist businesses with the growth and development of their general operations by ensuring the efficient, profitable, and sustainable supply/generation of water and energy allowing our potential customers to focus on their business while adopting strategies of sustainability. Using our identified technology, products, and services licensed or purchased from other technological sources, we are delivering and installing a product set that suits the green technology water and/or energy needs of our customers. By using the state-of-the art technological solutions and technologies identified, designed, and provided by EAWD and its collaborators, we believe that our potential clients will be free to focus on the performance of their operations as well as with the water and energy consumption or generation regulations within their industry. Our clients may be businesses seeking to upgrade their business processes or governmental entities seeking to apply green technology solutions for the water and energy they supply to their constituencies.
 
We continue to be a development stage company. The Company presently assembles its patent filled eAWGs at its workshop in Germany and outsources most of its engineering and technical services as well as services relating to the promotion, selling, and distribution of the identified technological solutions. We presently have only six employees, from those; Mr. Hofmeier, is our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board, and a significant stockholder, and Ms. Velazquez, is our Chief Operating Officer, Vice-Chairman, and a significant stockholder.
 
We seek to focus on three main aspects of the water and energy business: (1) generation, (2) supply, and (3) maintenance. We seek to assist private companies, government entities and municipalities NGOs to build profitable and sustainable supplies/generation capabilities of water and energy as required by selling them the required technology or technical service to enhance their productivity/operability. With its outsourced technical arm and its commission-based global network of vendors, the Company expects to create sustainable added value to each project it takes on while generating revenue from its engineering and technical consultancy services, project management, sale of our Self Sufficient Power Supply Atmosphere Water Generation Systems (eAWGs) Solar Energy Generation Systems and Energy Management Systems, royalties from the commercialization of energy and water in certain cases, and revenues from the licensed innovated technologies.

Our Products
 
The technological solutions offered by our Company are the following:
 
Self Sufficient Power Supply Atmosphere Water Generation System (eAWGs) & Aqua Mission Systems
 
Today, atmosphere water generators (AWGs) are standard equipment in many places; however, operating AWGs requires high amounts of energy that is often not available in the places where they are needed most, making the price for the generated water very high. Our innovative patent filled eAWGs are designed to have an internal power supply and ability to generate power. Our eAWG system produces sufficient quantities of potable water even in very dry and hot climate conditions and can be scaled to almost any size, community, and/or population. Presently, AWGs are largely used in Asian and African countries. The majority of manufacturers of AWGs, which rely on dehumidifying, are located in China. Almost every U.S. based AWG brand is also supplied by manufacturers in China.
 
By contrast, EAWD uses a proven German technology for condensate water from the air based on A/C technology. We believe that this method allows higher, more efficient, sustainable performance and a larger quantity of water generation because of its internal power supply and because it does not require high humidity to function. EAWD has licensed the rights to use this German AWG technology for ninety-nine years. Our eAWGs line is different in size from the standard AWG water generator line. Our eAWGs are energy self-sufficient and can condense large amounts of water out of the atmosphere and we believe they could be a solution in countries around the world that deal with issues of water scarcity.
 
Our eAWG with an internal power supply works by first inhaling large volumes of air, then cooling the air down to the dew point, and finally collecting, filtering, and mineralizing the resulting condensed water. Through this process, pure drinking water is created that meets the quality standards of the World Health Organization (WHO). In regions with high temperatures and high humidity levels, a single system Type I can generate up to 10,000 liters or 3,000 gallons of water per day. Our eAWGs line starts at 3,000 gallons/day and can expand the water supply to ONE acre-feet/day, (300,000 gallons or 1.2 Millon liter) which we believe, in effect, is essentially the ability to produce an unlimited supply of water. As a certified vendor of the United Nations Marketplace, EAWD is introducing the eAWGs to the UN with the hopes of initially supplying them to large refugee camps around the world in need of fresh water.
 
Solar Power Water Purification Systems
 
EAWD also seeks to respond to the growing need for drinking water by proposing a water purification solution utilizing solar, photovoltaic energy and, when applicable, a mini-windmill or other alternate source of renewable energy. The design of the system is ready to be built and delivered on demand.
 
Generally, drinking water is produced by passing sea water, lake water, river water, or stagnant water through several stages of purification and treatment until it is rendered drinkable in accordance with WHO standards. In the case of sea or stagnant water, we recommend a treatment via reverse osmosis membranes, which permits the retention of dissolved solids and results in obtaining water of drinking quality. If the water being treated emanates from lakes or rivers, we recommend treatment via an ultrafiltration membrane which functions by retaining suspended materials such as colloids, viruses and bacteria. The systems proposed by EAWD are containerized and contain all the equipment necessary to function autonomously, in part due to an automatic cleansing system that can be accessed remotely via satellite or the internet. Moreover, the machines use available renewable energy sources such as solar or wind.

Competition
 
The market witnesses the presence of a diversified array of large and small scale manufacturers resulting in a significant level of competition in the global market. The competition in the market, both in the residential and commercial sectors, is projected to grow in intensity and is characterized by the demand for advanced and reliable atmospheric water generator units. Rising demand for industrial-size eAWGs, particularly in regions facing water shortages, is expected to create opportunities for new market players such as EAWD through 2027. Moreover, current research that is focused on increasing overall product efficiency in the industry is anticipated to open new avenues for market players over the coming years. According to an atmospheric water generator market size report [published by Grand View Research in 2020], some of the prominent players in the atmospheric water generator (AWG) market include: Akvo Atmospheric Water Systems Pvt. Ltd., Dew Point Manufacturing, Saisons Trade & Industry Private Limited, Water Maker India Pvt. Ltd., Planets Water, Water Technologies International, Inc. (WTII), SkyWater Air Water Machines, Drinkable Air, Hendrx Water, Atlantis Solar, GENAQ Technologies S.L., Air2Water LLC, EcoloBlue, Inc and Watergen. On some level, each of these companies faces the two main industry challenges: carbon footprint and high-power requirement.
 
We compete by providing innovative systems assembled with state of the art technologies and that contain self-sufficient power supplies, which make them more sustainable and profitable than the traditional solutions. We also set ourselves apart by providing services that are valued by our customers such as reliable sales relationships, product innovations, and responses to changing market/business needs.
 
Government Regulation
 
The manufacturing, processing, testing, packaging, labeling, and advertising of the technologies that we sell may be subject to regulation by one or more U.S. federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and by the standards provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the World Health Organization for drinking water. Our operations may also be regulated by various agencies of states, localities, and foreign countries in which consumers reside. Currently, the technologies we intend to use in our solutions and our services are not subject to any governmental regulation in the United States although it is possible that the FDA may choose to regulate the quality of water produced from atmospheric water generating machines in the near future.

Since the Company may be subject to a wide range of regulation covering every aspect of our business as mentioned above, we cannot predict the nature of any future U.S. laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on the business in the future. Although the regulation of water is less restrictive than that of drugs and food additives, we cannot offer assurance that the current statutory scheme and regulations applicable to water will remain less restrictive. Further, we cannot assure you that, under existing laws and regulations, or if more stringent statutes are enacted, regulations are promulgated, or enforcement policies are adopted, we are or will be in compliance with these new statutes, regulations or enforcement policies without incurring material expenses or adjusting our business strategy. Any laws, regulations, enforcement policies, interpretations or applications applicable to our business could require the reformulation of products, all of which are supplied by third parties, to meet new standards or the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had six full-time employees. Over time, we will be required to hire employees or continue to engage independent contractors in order to execute the projects necessary to grow and develop the business. These decisions will be made by our officers and directors, if and when appropriate. We work with 34 commission-based agents and distributors to promote and sell the Company’s technology solutions. These agents and distributors are independent contractors with whom we have contractual relationships and are compensated solely based on commission.
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We elected to take advantage of all of these exemptions.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although we will lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We will qualify as a “large accelerated filer” as of the first day of the first fiscal year after we have (i) more than $700,000,000 in outstanding common equity held by our non-affiliates as of the last day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter; (ii) been a public company for at least 12 months; and (iii) filed at least one annual report with the SEC. The value of our outstanding common equity will be measured each year on the last day of our second fiscal quarter.
