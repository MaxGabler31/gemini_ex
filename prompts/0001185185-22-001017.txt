Item 1. Business
Background



We were originally incorporated as Adelt Design, Inc. on March 31, 2011 to manufacture and market carpet binding art. Production and marketing of carpet binding art never commenced. After CLS Labs, Inc. (“CLS Labs”) acquired 55.6% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, Jeffrey Binder, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of CLS Labs, was appointed Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Subsequently, we adopted amended and restated articles of incorporation, thereby changing its name to CLS Holdings USA, Inc.
The Merger



On April 29, 2015, we entered into a merger agreement with CLS Labs and a newly-formed, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger Sub”) and effected the Merger (the “Merger”). Upon the consummation of the Merger, the separate existence of the Merger Sub ceased and CLS Labs, the surviving corporation in the Merger, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with the Company acquiring the stock of CLS Labs, abandoning its previous business, and adopting the existing business plan and operations of CLS Labs. CLS Labs is a company that plans to generate revenues through licensing, fee-for-service and joint venture arrangements related to its patented proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into saleable concentrates.
Historical Operations



Since 2014, one of the founders of CLS Labs has been developing a proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into concentrates such as oils, waxes, edibles and shatter. These concentrates may be ingested in a number of ways, including through vaporization via e-cigarettes, and used for a variety of pharmaceutical and other purposes. Internal testing of the cannabinoids extracted through our patent-pending proprietary process versus the cannabinoids resulting from the processes commonly used in the industry, the results of which were reviewed and confirmed by an independent laboratory, has revealed that our process produces a cleaner, higher quality product and a significantly higher yield than the cannabinoid extraction processes currently existing in the marketplace.



As CLS Labs was unable to obtain a license in Colorado to operate a cannabis processing facility due to residency requirements, on April 17, 2015, CLS Labs took its first step toward commercializing its then patent pending proprietary methods and processes by entering into agreements with certain Colorado entities. During 2017, we suspended our plans to proceed with the Colorado agreements due to regulatory delays and have not yet determined when we will pursue it again.



On April 24, 2018, we were issued a U.S. patent with respect to our proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into concentrates such as oils, waxes, edibles and shatter. These concentrates may be ingested in a number of ways, including through vaporization via electronic cigarettes, and used for a variety of pharmaceutical and other purposes. Internal testing of this extraction method and conversion process has revealed that it produces a cleaner, higher quality product and a significantly higher yield than the cannabinoid extraction processes currently existing in the marketplace. We have not commercialized our proprietary process. We plan to generate revenues through licensing, fee-for-service and joint venture arrangements related to our proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into saleable concentrates.



We intend to monetize this extraction method and generate revenues through (i) the licensing of our proprietary methods and processes to others, (ii) the processing of cannabis for others, and (iii) the purchase of cannabis (or cultivation through our joint venture) and the processing and sale of cannabis-related products. We plan to accomplish this through the acquisition of companies, the creation of joint ventures, through licensing agreements, and through fee-for-service arrangements with growers and dispensaries of cannabis products. We believe that we can establish a position as one of the premier cannabinoid extraction and processing companies in the industry. Assuming we do so, we then intend to explore the creation of our own brand of concentrates for consumer use, which we would sell wholesale to cannabis dispensaries. We believe that we can create a “gold standard” national brand by standardizing the testing, compliance and labeling of our products in an industry currently comprised of small, local businesses with erratic and unreliable product quality, testing practices and labeling. Finally, we intend to grow through select acquisitions in secondary and tertiary markets, targeting newly regulated states that we believe offer a competitive advantage. Our goal at this time is to become a successful regional cannabis company.

Acquisition of Alternative Solutions



On June 27, 2018, the Company completed the purchase of all of the membership interests in Alternative Solutions and the Oasis LLCs from the members of such entities (other than Alternative Solutions). The closing occurred pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) entered into between the Company and Alternative Solutions on December 4, 2017, as amended. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the Company initially contemplated acquiring all of the membership interests in the Oasis LLCs from Alternative Solutions. Just prior to closing, the parties agreed that the Company would instead acquire all of the membership interests in Alternative Solutions, the parent of the Oasis LLCs, from its members, and the membership interests in the Oasis LLCs owned by members other than Alternative Solutions. The revised structure of the transaction is referenced in the Oasis Note (as defined below), which modified the Acquisition Agreement.



Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the Company paid a non-refundable deposit of $250,000 upon signing, which was followed by an additional payment of $1,800,000 paid in February 2018, for an initial 10% of each of the Oasis LLCs. At that time, the Company applied for regulatory approval to own an interest in the Oasis LLCs, which approval was received on June 21, 2018. On June 27, 2018, the Company made the payments to indirectly acquire the remaining 90% of the Oasis LLCs, which were equal to cash in the amount of $6,200,000 (less offsets for assumed liabilities), a $4.0 million promissory note due in December 2019 (the “Oasis Note”), and 22,058,823 shares of common stock. We used the proceeds of the Canaccord Special Warrant Offering to fund the cash portion of the closing consideration. On December 12, 2018, we were approved for the transfer of the remaining 90% interest. We received final regulatory approval to own our interest in the Oasis LLCs through Alternative Solutions under the revised structure of the transaction on April 26, 2022.



The number of purchase price shares was equal to 80% of the offering price of our common stock in our last equity offering, which price was $0.34 per share. The Oasis Note is secured by a first priority security interest over the membership interests in Alternative Solutions and the Oasis LLCs, as well as by the assets of the Oasis LLCs. The Oasis Note bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum and both principal and accrued interest were paid in full in December 2019. We also delivered a confession of judgment to a third party neutral representative of the parties that will become effective, in general, if we default under the Oasis Note.



At the time of closing of the Acquisition Agreement, Alternative Solutions owed certain amounts to a consultant known as 4Front Advisors, LLC (“4Front Advisors”). In August 2019, we made a payment to this company to settle this dispute and the Oasis Note was reduced accordingly.



The sellers of the membership interests in Alternative Solutions were also entitled to a $1,000,000 payment from us on May 30, 2020 if the Oasis LLCs had maintained an average revenue of $20,000 per day during the 2019 calendar year. This amount was fully accrued at May 31, 2019. In May 2020, we paid $850,000 of this amount to the sellers and deposited the balance of $150,000 in escrow pending the payment of a state sales and excise tax amount with respect to the pre-closing period. On February 8, 2021, $41,805 was released from escrow to us and $106,195 was released to Serenity Wellness Enterprises, LLC. We then paid the total tax due to the Department of Taxation.



None of the sellers of the membership interests in Alternative Solutions or the Oasis LLCs was affiliated with the Company prior to the closing. In connection with the closing, however, the Company employed Benjamin Sillitoe, the CEO and a member of Alternative Solutions, as the Chief Executive Officer of CLS Nevada, Inc., and Don Decatur, the COO of the Oasis LLCs, as the Chief Operating Officer of CLS Nevada, Inc. for a period of time following closing.

Nevada Operations



We own 100% of Alternative Solutions, LLC, a Nevada-based holding company (“Alternative Solutions”), which is a Nevada-based holding company that owns three separate entities with licenses to operate cannabis businesses within the State of Nevada: Serenity Wellness Center, LLC dba Oasis Cannabis (“Oasis”); Serenity Wellness Growers, LLC dba City Trees Fresh Cannabis Cultivation Wholesale; and Serenity Wellness Products, LLC dba City Trees Fresh Cannabis Production Wholesale. Oasis currently operates a retail marijuana dispensary within walking distance to the Las Vegas Strip. Its other subsidiaries, which do business as City Trees Cultivation and City Trees Production, currently operate a small-scale cultivation facility, as well as a product manufacturing facility and a wholesale distribution operation in North Las Vegas. Management expects that the vertically integrated business model will drive strong margins to the bottom line on a large portion of existing sales at the dispensary as the newly expanded Warehouse Facility becomes fully operational.(See section entitled “Expansion of Cultivation Facilities” below).



Oasis’ retail dispensary is a single location operation in Nevada and occupies over 5,000 square feet of an over 20,000 square foot building This location, which is easily accessible by tourists, is currently open 19.5 hours per day for walk-in / in-store pickup and 19.5 hours per day for curbside orders. It also delivers cannabis to residents between the hours of 8:00 AM and 10:00 PM. The central location provides logistical convenience for delivery to all parts of the Las Vegas valley.

City Trees’ wholesale operations, which occupies approximately 10,000 square feet of a 22,000 square foot warehouse (the “Warehouse Facility”), began sales to third parties in August 2017 and completed construction and received certificate of occupancy for its state-of-the-art extraction facility in December of 2019. It had made sales to over 45 external customers as of February 28, 2022. Its existing product line includes vaporizers, tinctures, ethanol produced THC distillate, and live and cured hydrocarbon concentrates. At present, the City Trees cultivation facility only grows breeding stock to preserve valuable genetics and does not offer its crops for sale or processing. As a result, all raw materials for manufacturing are sourced from third parties. See “Our Business”.



The New Mexico Licensing Arrangement



On April 29, 2021, Serenity Wellness Products LLC entered into a Licensing Agreement with a company in New Mexico to manufacture and distribute tinctures in New Mexico under our City Trees brand name. In addition, we agreed to manufacture and distribute cannabis infused baked goods, which are products we do not currently offer, under the “Herbal Edibles” brand at our dispensary in Nevada. The Agreement expired in May 2022 and we did not renew it.
Quinn River Joint Venture



On October 20, 2021, we entered into a management services agreement (the “Quinn River Joint Venture Agreement”) through our 50% owned subsidiary, Kealii Okamalu, with CSI Health MCD LLC (“CSI”) and a commission established by the authority of the Tribal Council of the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe (“Tribe”). The purpose of the Quinn River Joint Venture Agreement is to establish a business (the “Quinn River Joint Venture”) to grow, cultivate, process, and sell cannabis and related products. The Quinn River Joint Venture Agreement has an initial term of 10 years plus a 10 year renewal option from the date the first cannabis crop produced is harvested and sold. Pursuant to the Quinn River Joint Venture Agreement, Kealii Okamalu is expected to lease approximately 20-30 acres of the Tribe’s land located along the Quinn River at a cost of $3,500 per quarter and manage the design, finance and construction of a cannabis cultivation facility on such tribal lands (“the Cultivation Facility”). Kealii Okamalu will also manage the ongoing operations of the Cultivation Facility and related business, including, but not limited to, cultivation of cannabis crops, personnel staffing, product packaging, testing, marketing and sales. Packaged products will be branded as “Quinn River Farms.” We will provide 10,000 square feet of warehouse space at our Las Vegas facility, and will have preferred vendor status including the right to purchase cannabis flower and the business’s cannabis trim at favorable prices. Kealii Okamalu will contribute $6 million towards the construction of the Cultivation Facility and the working capital for the Quinn River Joint Venture. This amount will be repaid from the portion of the net profits of the Quinn River Joint Venture otherwise payable to CSI and the Tribe at the rate of $750,000 per quarter for eight quarters. Kealii Okamalu will receive one-third of the net profits of the Quinn River Joint Venture. We are the manager of and hold a 50% ownership interest in Kealii Okamalu. Kealii Okamalu is a variable interest entity which we consolidate. The Quinn River Joint Venture is not a legal entity but rather a business operated by Kealii Okamalu.
Market Growth



Legal cannabis sales in the U.S. have grown substantially in recent years. This growth trend is expected to continue as more states legalize medical and recreational cannabis and as more consumers choose to make legal cannabis purchases instead of buying through traditional sources. Consumers who are learning about new research supporting the health and the perceived medical benefits of cannabis will be a secondary source of strong growth in the market for the next several years.



Cannabis sales in Nevada have exceeded all expectations since recreational sales began on July 1, 2017. Management believes that the Nevada market will continue to grow for the next few years albeit more modestly if the market is impacted by a national recession. This expectation is supported by sales trends in other legal markets like Colorado and Washington.



Internal Growth Strategy



Oasis expects to continue to grow its dispensary market share both organically and by adding additional locations within the Nevada market. Oasis will seek to expand its footprint throughout the state in select locations with access to tourists or in residential areas with above average median income. The locations of the potential acquisitions will only matter to the extent that they are in preferable local jurisdictions. For licensing purposes, the physical location of a cannabis establishment in Nevada may be moved if it remains in the same local municipality or jurisdiction. Oasis currently purchases about $150,000 per month in products from City Trees, at cost. As a result of these purchases, Oasis has reduced its cost of goods sold on all its SKUs by approximately half, increasing its gross margin.



City Trees’ wholesale growth strategy focuses on more fully utilizing its new and expanded state-of-the-art Warehouse Facility, which was completed in December 2019, by adding new customers and increasing product line diversity, uniqueness, and penetration at each customer’s retail location. City Trees has about 45 customers with regular recurring orders at dispensaries located throughout Nevada.

Dispensary Operations



Oasis opened as a medical cannabis dispensary in 2015 and began retail sales to adults over the age of 21 on July 1, 2017. Customers and patients can browse the selection of inventory on display and ask questions to qualified staff with minimal wait times. The dispensary was renovated in November of 2019. The renovations included updating the sales floor by adding an additional 8 registers, as well as an inventory storage behind the sales staff which allows for a smoother and overall better customer experience within Oasis.
Inventory Management



The revenues of Oasis have increased since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The operations of the Oasis dispensary, however, have changed markedly since the onset of COVID-19. Prior to the pandemic, almost all of the Oasis sales were made in its dispensary. In recent months, approximately 20% of its sales were made via delivery or curbside sales and approximately 80% of sales were made in the dispensary.



All inventory is tracked in the state-mandated METRC seed to sale tracking system. Additionally, we have implemented Leaf Logix for our point of sale and internal inventory management system. Each item is stored in a designated physical location that is also reflected in the inventory control system. All products are prepackaged before arriving at the retail store and a barcode is added to each package to ensure the proper products are fulfilled in each order. Leaf Logix synchronizes its sales and inventory data with METRC, but we also regularly reconcile the two systems for additional assurance of compliance with state mandated inventory tracking accuracy. Regular, independent inventory counts ensure that any physical variances from the tracking system are detected and addressed immediately. All product that is unusable is destroyed and logged with photo-evidence according to state regulations.



Product Selection



Product selections are currently managed by a team comprised of the Director of CLS Nevada, General Manager, and Inventory Team Leader/Purchaser. As Oasis adds new locations, it will form a centralized purchasing team supervised by the Director that will ensure there is consistent product selection across all locations. The Inventory Team Leader/Purchaser, or the Director will be responsible for negotiating bulk purchase discounts and maintaining target gross margins. Inventory Team Leader/Purchaser or Director will also be responsible for quality assurance and product mix. Each new vendor is researched, and their operations are visited whenever possible. Product samples are distributed to various employees and feedback is reviewed before making final product decisions. Oasis carries between 30 and 40 different cultivars or “strains” of cannabis flowers in addition to a wide variety of cannabis products such as vaporizers, concentrated oil, edibles, capsules, tinctures, and beverages.
Payment System and Banking



Payments made at Oasis can be completed via cash or a debit cashless ATM system. Cash risk is minimized by making regular deposits in our bank account at a credit union, located in Colorado. Cash deposits are picked up by armed personnel and taken to the LA Federal Reserve Bank where the deposit is made on our behalf.
Home Delivery



Home delivery is currently about 10% of the total sales mix of Oasis. Customers can call or place orders online for both pickup and delivery. The current delivery fees are as follows: $50.00 minimum through $74.99 (subtotal) is a $10.00 delivery fee; $75.00 through $99.99 (subtotal) is a $7.00 delivery fee; and all sales over $100.00 (subtotal) get free delivery. Home deliveries average well over $100 per order, which is about 75% higher than in-store orders. Oasis is centrally located within the Las Vegas valley which makes it roughly equally distant from all areas of town. This allows the store to have a much wider geographic reach than it otherwise would. Many locals work on the Las Vegas Strip close to the store and will shop there when going to and from a shift. Offering delivery also allows them to conveniently make a purchase from Oasis without having to drive past a cannabis store that might be located closer to their homes. Many consumers prefer the convenience of home delivery and this allows Oasis to be their dispensary of choice regardless of how close they live to the store.
Pricing Strategy



Oasis targets at least a 50% gross margin when determining pricing for any given product. Market dynamics such as supply, demand, and competitive pressure can cause variances from the target. The Inventory Team Leader/Purchaser of Oasis, as part of the purchasing team, conducts a pricing survey for all new products to determine which of the competition in close proximity carries the product and how much such competition is charging for similar products.

Marketing Strategy



Oasis uses a variety of methods to reach consumers including billboards, paid digital and video online ads, social media, marketing to rideshare drivers, and social engagement through a calendar of events at its community center called Community Oasis. It also uses radio advertisements to gain extra exposure for special events, such as April 20th and Halloween celebrations. These radio advertisements have proven to be effective and cost efficient only when there is a new event or great offer to share, so they are used only for a limited time and when there is a compelling message. Further, Oasis is recognized as the local choice and has an aggressive rewards program that serves to keep locals engaged in the brand. In order to stay top of mind with their consumers Oasis sends out daily text messages to over 10,000 people and weekly emails to an additional 10,000 people. Oasis employs a Director of Marketing who is responsible for developing and implementing the quarterly marketing strategies that coincide with different seasons and events in Las Vegas.
Cultivation, Production & Wholesale Sales Operations



City Trees’ wholesale laboratory operations are now fully operational, with all oil being manufactured in-house and formulated into a variety of finished products for sale and distribution to retail cannabis stores and medical dispensaries throughout Nevada. The laboratory throughput and design was implemented in such a way that extra capacity could be absorbed by third party toll processing, and as such, City Trees’ is processing approximately 300 pounds of raw material per month for third party vendors between both ethanol and hydrocarbon extraction methods. The entire division processes approximately 1,200 pounds of biomass extracted with ethanol and 500 pounds of biomass extracted with hydrocarbons, monthly. The ability to produce has significantly improved the cost of goods sold for Oasis. (See section entitled “Expansion of Cultivation Facilities” below.)



City Trees’ grow operation cultivates plants for breeding and preserves quality stock and does not harvest its plants for either production or for sale to third parties. Some of these cultivars are High Times Cannabis Cup Winners which provide intrinsic value for not only breeding but for possible licensing deals with exclusive rights and/or access. In January 2021, City Trees launched a new division, Trichome Harvest Company, specializing in toll processing for regional and national cannabis brands licensed in the state of Nevada with a variety of transaction types and negotiable terms.



Expansion of Cultivation Facilities



City Trees Cultivation is in the preliminary stages of expanding its grow operation and implementing additional manufacturing operations using both Alternative Solutions’ existing processing methods, our patented processing methods and our new joint venture. City Trees Cultivation intends to build out a grow operation to manufacture products for Oasis. Based on current wholesale prices for cannabis, however, which are relatively low due to ample supply, these plans are on hold, we will continue to monitor wholesale cannabis press and determine if and when to proceed.
Product Line



City Trees offers the following product lines to its wholesale customers:




● | The vaporizer, live and cured concentrate product line consists of proprietary blends of cannabis oil and terpenes filled into custom branded City Trees vaporizers that utilize ceramic heating technology to deliver clean, even heat without using a wick like most traditional vaporizers. We recently launched six new flavors, including Mango Haze, GMO, Cherry Cola, LV Confidential, Gasolina and cucumber melon.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The City Trees line of tinctures includes a 1 to 1 to 1 CBD to THC to CBG ratio, 20 to 1 and 1 to 1 CBD to THC ratios, as well as THC only versions. The tinctures are available in four different carriers and flavors, MCT oil, agave nectar, chocolate agave nectar and orange cream.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pricing Strategy



The raw materials cost inputs have dropped over the last year because of an increase in the supply of raw materials to produce THC distillate We target retail prices to be competitive against other high-end brands and to deliver strong margins to City Trees and its retail customers.

Single Stream Inventory



In Nevada, as long as a wholesale facility holds both a medical and a recreational license, it may sell products to dispensaries that may be sold to both recreational and medical customers. As long as the dispensary also holds both licenses, the inventory may be sold to either type of customer as long as it came from a wholesale company with both license types. This reduces logistical challenges that would otherwise arise from having two separate streams of inventory to service the medical and adult-use segments.
Licenses



A Cannabis Retail Store License or Medical Cannabis Dispensary Registration Certificate allows for the sale of cannabis products to the applicable end consumer. A company must hold both licenses to be able to sell products to both types of consumers. A cannabis retail store and a medical cannabis dispensary may also deliver to residents in Nevada without any additional licensing. Both local and state licenses are required.



A Retail (adult-use or recreational) Cannabis Cultivation or Medical Cannabis Cultivation Registration Certificate allows the holder to grow as much cannabis as it can in its approved cultivation space. There is no limitation to the number of plants that may be grown at any time. The Cannabis Compliance Board can limit the amount of cultivation space through a public meeting if it determines such a limitation is needed.



A Retail (adult-use or recreational) Cannabis Product Manufacturing license or Medical Cannabis Production Registration Certificate allows for the extraction, conversion, and manufacturing of raw cannabis material into finished consumer packaged goods. The Cannabis Compliance Board (“CCB”) must approve all formulas, processes, equipment, products, and packaging prior to any manufacturing or sales.



A Retail (adult-use or recreational) Cannabis Distributor License allows licensees to deliver wholesale products from a cultivator or manufacturer to a retail store. This is only a requirement for products that could be sold to recreational customers. Many vertically integrated operators are forced to use third party distributors to deliver products from their wholesale facilities to their own stores and to other customers. City Trees holds one of a limited number of distributor licenses that exist to serve the more than 60 medical dispensaries or retail stores and approximately 200 wholesalers in the state. Oasis is licensed to operate in the City of Las Vegas as a Dual-Licensed Medical Marijuana Dispensary and Marijuana Retail Store Business, and in the State of Nevada as a Medical Cannabis Dispensary Establishment and a Cannabis Retail Store. City Trees Production is licensed to operate in the State of Nevada as a Medical Cannabis Production Establishment, a Retail Cannabis Product Manufacturing facility and a Retail Cannabis Distributor. City Trees is also licensed to operate in the State of Nevada as a Medical Cannabis Cultivation Facility and a Retail Cannabis Cultivator. Please see “Our Business – Regulation and Licensure – Oasis LLC Licenses” for a complete list of state and local licenses held by the Oasis LLCs and “Our Business – Regulation and Licensure – Nevada Licenses and Regulations” for additional information regarding Nevada licensures.



Specialized Skill & Knowledge



Commercial cannabis cultivation requires access to employees with specialized skills and knowledge in order to maximize harvest quality and yield in addition to having the capacity for developing new varieties. Botanical extraction of concentrated oils, product formulation and product manufacturing each require their own specific sets of specialized skill and knowledge to ensure maximization of yields and quality from extraction and to create consistent, high quality products. Additionally, the operation of a quality retail cannabis store requires extensive product knowledge to provide the optimal experience for customers. Each of these operations requires extensive knowledge and understanding of the Nevada regulatory landscape to ensure compliance with all local and state laws and regulations.



The Director of Laboratory Operations has gained important skills and knowledge through experience with all areas needed to run a successful cultivation and extraction operation. These include indoor warehouse, outdoor, greenhouse, greenhouse light deprivation, meristem tissue culture, hydroponic irrigation/fertigation, DWC, coco, soil, rockwool, no-till, organic and synthetic feedings, and non-solvent, hydrocarbon, ethanol, and CO2 extraction respectively. With these skills and knowledge, we expect the Company to continue to develop unique, new strains that are only available to City Trees and will build on the current knowledge of the organization through testing new techniques and technologies in a small research and development room within the cultivation facility. The previous experience of the management team of CLS Nevada, along with independent consultation, is the basis for Oasis’ proprietary standard operating procedures that we believe will ensure consistent quality and yield performance.



 12

 



The extraction/product formulation team is headed by a Doctor of Pharmacy and includes employees with hands-on experience in cannabis extraction and product manufacturing. This provides access to both the technical and hands-on applications of knowledge that benefits product formulation in addition to extraction efficiency and productivity.



The leadership at CLS Nevada is knowledgeable in all the products available in the United States market because the leadership at Oasis has operated in Nevada since the beginning of medical cannabis sales.



We conduct ongoing training to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations. The leadership of each business unit attends regular compliance training conducted by local and state officials which provides content and updates for internal training.



In addition to our internal resources, there is a broad market of skilled employees with cannabis knowledge and experience in Nevada to facilitate growth of the labor force.



Competitive Conditions



We currently operate in the Nevada cannabis market, which has limited licensing opportunities for retail locations in accordance with state regulations. These conditions create significant barriers to entry for new competition.



There is currently no legal limitation on the number of cultivation and product manufacturing licenses that may be issued and there is no limitation on how much can be grown or produced with those licenses. However, the CCB is tasked with determining what it believes is an adequate supply of cultivation and production licenses and at present there is no open application period.



The limitation on the number of licenses available for retail creates a significant barrier to entry for potential competition in the retail cannabis market. Acquisition is the only method available for most companies to enter the state’s retail cannabis market absent changes in legislation. There is also a 10% legal limitation on the number of retail licenses that may be owned by any one entity within a given county. The size and number of locations in a potential acquisition are limited as a result. These conditions mitigate the risk of losing market share to new companies entering the Nevada retail market.



The wholesale market, however, is more fluid. At present, both supply and demand for raw cannabis are increasing, but the increase in supply precipitated by the commencement of recreational sales is outpacing the increase in demand. As a result, Nevada wholesale prices have decreased over the last year. We have undertaken and, in some cases, completed various expansion projects to meet the additional demand but we are carefully watching changes in the supply market. Most of the additional supply has been provided by existing participants within the market as very few new cultivation licenses have been issued since 2018. The ability to expand facilities without limitation will allow the market to reach an equilibrium wholesale price point without the need to license additional operators. Although there is no legal limitation on cultivation and production licenses, we do not currently anticipate that new licenses will be issued because there is no open application period at this time for new cultivation or production licenses.



Regardless of whether supply remains high, we believe we can benefit from market conditions. A low cost for raw cannabis will likely benefit our production operation, which is expected to ramp up now that our Warehousing Facility expansion is complete and our state-of-the-art processing facility is operational, as we expect that we can produce more quality product with less raw cannabis, thus partially offsetting the impact of low wholesale prices. Low wholesale prices could also benefit our Oasis dispensary as this reduces our cost of product. If conditions change and supply is reduced, we can expand our cultivation facility.



Components



Raw materials for processing and manufacturing are available from a variety of sources. Oasis maintains relationships with various suppliers for each key component of the raw materials to mitigate vendor concentration risk. City Trees wholesale operations is the sole purchaser of raw materials within the organization because the retail operation only stocks finished consumer packaged products. Raw materials are currently purchased from third parties and oils, to a larger extent, are processed for Oasis by City Trees.

Patent and Trademarks



We have developed extraction and processing methods that are proprietary and, on April 24, 2018, the Company (via CLS Labs) was awarded a non-provisional U.S. utility patent for cannabidiol extraction and conversion process (the “Extraction Process”) by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (U.S. patent number 9,950,976 B1). The Extraction Process is expected to result in increased product consistency, cost savings for growers, and increased anticipated revenues for us due to the larger amount of Delta-9 THC that we believe it can produce. We may use a version of the patented technology on a smaller scale at our Warehouse Facility and/or license the technology to others.



Internal testing of the Extraction Process has revealed that such process produces a cleaner, higher quality product and a higher yield than the cannabinoid extraction processes currently existing in the marketplace. We have not commercialized the Extraction Process. We plan to generate revenues through licensing, fee-for-service and joint venture arrangements related to the Extraction Process from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into saleable concentrates.



We intend to monetize the Extraction Process and generate revenues through (i) the licensing of its patented processes to others, (ii) the processing of cannabis for others, and (iii) the purchase of cannabis (or cultivation through our joint venture) and the processing and sale of cannabis-related products. We plan to accomplish this through the acquisition of companies, the creation of joint ventures, through licensing agreements, and through fee-for-service arrangements with growers and dispensaries of cannabis products. We then intend to explore the creation of its own brand of concentrates for consumer use, which it would sell wholesale to cannabis dispensaries. We believe that it can standardize the testing, compliance and labeling of its products in the cannabis industry.

We believe in equal opportunity employment and we recruit, hire and promote individuals that are best qualified for each position without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin or handicap. We pride ourselves on using a selection process that recruits people who are trainable, co-operative and share the core values of the Company. Our employees are highly-talented individuals who have educational achievements ranging from masters and undergraduate degrees in a wide range of disciplines, as well as staff who have been trained on the job to uphold the highest standards set as a Company.



We recruit based on a rigorous interview process to ensure the right candidates are selected for the Company and the individual team. In addition to adherence to our core values, it requires that each employee acts with integrity and constant striving to uphold the highest professional standards.



In addition, the safety of our employees is a priority and we are committed to the prevention of illness and injury through the provision and maintenance of a healthy workplace. We take all reasonable step to ensure staff are appropriately informed and trained to ensure the safety of themselves as well as others around them.



In addition to the Oasis employees, the Company employs three executive and management personnel and engages one consultant in a management capacity.



As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we initially furloughed 23 of our employees, including 19 dispensary employees and 4 employees of City Trees. As our dispensary and our City Trees’ revenues have steadily improved and now exceed pre-COVID-19 levels, we have rehired all the furloughed employees who wished to return and have replaced all of the jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic.



Growth Strategy



Our growth strategy includes the following plans:




● | Securing capital for the construction of processing centers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtaining the necessary state and local licensure for each proposed facility.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Securing initial licensing, processing or sales arrangements, as applicable, with growers and dispensaries, and for our joint venture. Such arrangements may result from marketing efforts, relationships within the industry.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Constructing processing facilities.
--+------------------------------------


● | Expanding per-facility capacity and increasing revenues.
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing a national brand of cannabis concentrates, which will be sold wholesale to dispensaries, through standardization of the testing, compliance and labeling process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We also intend to grow through select acquisitions in secondary and tertiary markets, targeting newly regulated states that we believe offer a competitive advantage. Our goal at this time is to become a successful regional cannabis company.



Regulation and Licensure



Despite 38 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories having legalized or decriminalized cannabis use for recreational or medical purposes, the prescription, use and possession of cannabis remains illegal under federal law. As such, although we will only operate processing facilities in states that permit the possession, sale and use of cannabis, certain activities of our business, including the possession of cannabis for processing and the sale of cannabis concentrates, will be in violation of federal law.

Enforcement of United States Federal Laws



In the United States, cannabis is highly regulated at the state level. To our knowledge, over half of the United States of America, plus the District of Columbia, and four territories have legalized cannabis in some form, including recreational use of cannabis in many states. Additional states have legalized CBD, low THC oils for a limited class of patients. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of cannabis at the state level, cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (codified in 21 U.S.C.A. Section 812). Under United States federal law, a Schedule I drug is considered to have a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for the use of the substance under medical supervision. Federal law tightly regulates or outright prohibits commercial production and sale of all Schedule I controlled substances, and as such, cannabis-related activities, including without limitation, the importation, cultivation, manufacture, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis that remain illegal under U.S. federal law. It is also illegal to aid or abet such activities or to conspire or attempt to engage in such activities. Strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor provide a defense to any federal proceeding brought against the Company. An investor’s contribution to and involvement in such activities may result in federal civil and/or criminal prosecution, including, but not limited to, forfeiture of his, her or its entire investment, fines and/or imprisonments.



As a result of the conflicting views between states and the federal government regarding cannabis, investments in, and the operations of, cannabis businesses in the U.S. are subject to inconsistent laws and regulations. The so-called “Cole Memorandum” or “Cole Memo” issued by former Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013 and other Obama-era cannabis policy guidance, discussed below, provided the framework for managing the tension between federal and state cannabis laws. Subsequently, as discussed below, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo and related policy guidance. Although no longer in effect, these policies, and the enforcement priorities established within, appear to continue to be followed during the Trump administration and remain critical factors that inform the past and future trend of state-based legalization.



On January 4, 2018, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo, the Cole Banking Memorandum, and all other related Obama-era DOJ cannabis enforcement guidance. While the rescission did not change federal law, as the Cole Memo and other DOJ guidance documents were not themselves laws, the rescission removed the DOJ’s formal policy that state-regulated cannabis businesses in compliance with the Cole Memo guidelines should not be a prosecutorial priority. Notably, Attorney General Sessions’ rescission of the Cole Memo has not affected the status of the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) memorandum issued by the Department of Treasury, which remains in effect. This memorandum outlines Bank Secrecy Act-compliant pathways for financial institutions to service state-sanctioned cannabis businesses, which echoed the enforcement priorities outlined in the Cole Memo. In addition to his rescission of the Cole Memo, Attorney General Sessions issued a one-page memorandum known as the “Sessions Memorandum”. The Sessions Memorandum explains the DOJ’s rationale for rescinding all past DOJ cannabis enforcement guidance, claiming that Obama-era enforcement policies are “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance adopted in the 1980s, in chapter 9.27.230 of the USAM. The USAM enforcement priorities, like those of the Cole Memo, are based on the use of the federal government’s limited resources and include “law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General,” the “seriousness” of the alleged crimes, the “deterrent effect of criminal prosecution,” and “the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” Although the Sessions Memorandum emphasizes that cannabis is a federally illegal Schedule I controlled substance, it does not otherwise instruct U.S. Attorneys to consider the prosecution of cannabis-related offenses a DOJ priority, and in practice, most U.S. Attorneys have not changed their prosecutorial approach to date. However, due to the lack of specific direction in the Sessions Memorandum as to the priority federal prosecutors should ascribe to such cannabis activities, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not seek to prosecute cases involving cannabis businesses that are otherwise compliant with state law.



William Barr served as United States Attorney General from February 14, 2019 to December 23, 2020. The DOJ under Mr. Barr did not take a formal position on federal enforcement of laws relating to cannabis. On March 11, 2021, United States President Biden’s nominee, Merrick Garland was sworn in as the U.S. Attorney General. During his campaign, President Biden stated a policy goal to decriminalize possession of cannabis at the federal level, but he has not publicly supported the full legalization of cannabis. It is unclear what impact, if any, the new administration will have on U.S. federal government enforcement policy on cannabis. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that the position of the Department of Justice will not change.



Such potential proceedings could involve significant restrictions being imposed upon the Company or third parties, and also divert the attention of key executives. Such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, operating results and financial condition as well as our reputation, even if such proceedings were concluded successfully in favor of the Company. See “Risk Factors”.



 17

 



For the reasons set forth above, our existing operations in the United States, and any future operations or investments the Company may engage in, may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. As a result, the Company may be subject to significant direct and indirect interaction with public officials. There can be no assurance that this heightened scrutiny will not in turn lead to the imposition of certain restrictions on our ability to operate in the United States or any other jurisdiction. See “Risk Factors”.



Government policy changes or public opinion may also result in a significant influence over the regulation of the cannabis industry in the United States or elsewhere. A negative shift in the public’s perception of medical cannabis in the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction could affect future legislation or regulation. Among other things, such a shift could cause state jurisdictions to abandon initiatives or proposals to legalize medical cannabis, thereby limiting the number of new state jurisdictions into which the Company could expand. Any inability to fully implement our expansion strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors”.



Further, violations of any federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, its holding (directly or indirectly) of medical cannabis licenses in the United States, the listing of its securities on various stock exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its publicly traded shares. In addition, it is difficult for the Company to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or its final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial. See “Risk Factors”.



United States Enforcement Proceedings



An appropriations rider contained in the fiscal year 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Acts (formerly known as the “Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment”; now known as the “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment” and currently proposed for the next appropriations rider as the “Joyce Amendment”, referred to herein as the “Amendment”) provides budgetary constraints on the federal government’s ability to interfere with the implementation of state-based medical cannabis laws. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and other courts have interpreted the language to mean that the DOJ cannot expend funds to prosecute state-law-abiding medical cannabis operators complying strictly with state medical cannabis laws. The Amendment prohibits the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to prevent states from implementing their own medical cannabis laws. Previously the Amendment was extended until December 8, 2018, as part of the passage of an emergency aid package. The Amendment has now been renewed and is effective through September 30, 2022. Through his signing statement, former President Trump reiterated that the Department of Justice may not use any funds to prevent implementation of medical cannabis laws by various States and territories, and “I will treat this provision consistent with the President’s constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute the laws of the United States.” Continued reauthorization of the Amendment is predicated on future political developments and cannot be guaranteed. If the Amendment expires, federal prosecutors could prosecute even state-compliant medical cannabis operators for conduct within the five-year statute of limitations. The Amendment does not protect state legal adult-use cannabis businesses and the DOJ may spend funds to prosecute persons that are operating in accordance with state adult use cannabis laws. However, the United States Congress also passed the Blumenauer-McClintock-Norton-Lee Amendment which would provide legal protection for all state legal cannabis activities. It is unclear whether the amendment language will be included in the Senate appropriations language. Various other pieces of legislation have been introduced by members of Congress that would legalize cannabis at a federal level, although it is uncertain if any of the proposed bills will gain any traction. Most recently the United States House of Representatives passed the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (“MORE”), but it is expected to be stalled in the United States Senate.
Ability to Access Public and Private Capital



We have historically, and continue to have, access to equity and debt financing from the public and prospectus exempt (private placement) markets in Canada and, to a lesser extent, in the United States. Our executive team and board of directors also have extensive relationships with sources of private capital (such as funds and high net worth individuals), that could be investigated at a higher cost of capital. If such equity and/or debt financing was no longer available in the public markets due to changes in applicable law, then the Company expects that it would have access to raise equity and/or debt financing privately.



 18

 



Although we are not able to obtain bank financing in the U.S. or financing from other U.S. federally regulated entities, we currently have access to equity financing through the private markets in Canada and in the United States. Since the use of cannabis is illegal under U.S. federal law, and in light of concerns in the banking industry regarding money laundering and other federal financial crime related to cannabis, U.S. banks have been reluctant to accept deposit funds from businesses involved with the cannabis industry. Consequently, businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have difficulty finding a bank willing to accept their business. Likewise, cannabis businesses have limited, if any, access to credit card processing services. As a result, cannabis businesses in the U.S. are largely cash-based. This complicates the implementation of financial controls and increases security issues.



Commercial banks, private equity firms and venture capital firms have approached the cannabis industry cautiously to date. However, there are increasing numbers of high net worth individuals and family offices that have made meaningful investments in companies and projects similar to our projects. Although there has been an increase in the amount of private financing available over the last several years, there is neither a broad nor deep pool of institutional capital that is available to cannabis license holders and license applicants. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if raised privately, will be available to us when needed or on terms which are acceptable. Our inability to raise financing to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit our growth and may have a material adverse effect upon future profitability. See “Risk Factors”.



State-Level Overview



The following sections present an overview of market and regulatory conditions for the cannabis industry in the state of Nevada, in which we have an operating presence in, and is presented as of April 2022, unless otherwise indicated. Although our activities are compliant with applicable United States state and local law, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under United States federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company.



Nevada Cannabis Licenses and the COVID-19 Pandemic



On March 12, 2020, Governor Steven Sisolak declared a State of Emergency related to the COVID-19 global pandemic. This State of Emergency was initiated due to the multiple confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19 in the State of Nevada. On March 17, 2020, pursuant to the Declaration of Emergency, Governor Sisolak released the Nevada Health Response COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Initiative (“Initiative”). This Initiative provided guidance related to the March 12 Declaration of Emergency, requiring Nevadans to stay home and all nonessential businesses to temporarily close to the public for thirty (30) days. In the Initiative, it was declared that licensed cannabis stores and medical dispensaries could remain open only if employees and consumers strictly adhered to the social distancing protocols.



In light of the Initiative, Governor Sisolak issued Declaration of Emergency Directive 003 on March 20, 2020 which mandated retail cannabis dispensaries to operate as delivery only. On April 29, 2020, Governor Sisolak issued Declaration of Emergency Directive 016 which amended the cannabis section of Directive 003 and permitted licensed cannabis dispensaries to engage in retail sales on a curbside pickup or home delivery basis pursuant to guidance from the Cannabis Compliance Board. Through Directive 016, licensed cannabis dispensaries were able to begin curbside pickup on May 1, 2020 so long as the facility adhered to protocols developed by the CCB.



In accordance with Directive 016, the CCB released guidelines related to curbside pickup requiring all facilities wishing to offer curbside pickup to first submit and receive approval from the CCB. Serenity Wellness Center LLC developed the required procedures and submitted and received State approval on April 30, 2020 to conduct curbside pickup sales effective May 1, 2020. Further, the City of Las Vegas required cannabis facilities to obtain a temporary 30-day curbside pickup permit. Serenity Wellness Center LLC was issued its first temporary curbside pickup permit from the City of Las Vegas on May 1, 2020. Serenity Wellness Center LLC has subsequently received a temporary curbside permit every thirty (30) days thereafter. Upon expiration every 30 days, the City of Las Vegas reviews the licensee and determines if a new temporary permit shall be issued.



On May 7, 2020, Governor Sisolak issued Declaration of Emergency Directive 018. Directive 018 worked to reopen the State of Nevada as a part of Phase One of the Nevada United: Roadmap to Recovery Plan introduced by Governor Sisolak on April 30, 2020. Directive 018 provided that, in addition to curbside pickup or home delivery, licensed cannabis dispensaries could engage in retail sales on an in-store basis effective May 9, 2020, pursuant to guidance from the CCB. The CCB required facilities wishing to engage in limited in-store retail sales to submit Standard Operating Procedures and receive approval of the same. Serenity Wellness Center LLC developed the required procedures and submitted and received State approval on May 8, 2020 to conduct limited in-store retail sales effective May 9, 2020. The City of Las Vegas did not require a separate permit for limited in-store sales.



 19

 



On July 31, 2020, Governor Sisolak issued Declaration of Emergency Directive 029 reaffirming The Nevada United: Roadmap to Recovery Plan. Directive 029 stated that all directives promulgated pursuant to the March 12, 2020 Declaration of Emergency or subsections thereof set to expire on July 31, 2020, would remain in effect for the duration of the current state of emergency unless terminated prior to that date by a subsequent directive or by operation of law associated with lifting the Declaration of Emergency. Further, Directive 029, having become effective at 11:59 PM on Friday, July 31, 2020 shall remain in effect until terminated by a subsequent directive promulgated pursuant to the March 12, 2020 Declaration of Emergency, or dissolution or lifting of the Declaration of Emergency itself, to facilitate the State’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On February 10, 2022, Governor Sisolak terminated and rescinded virtually all prior directives relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.



Nevada Summary



Medical Cannabis Program 



Nevada has a medical cannabis program and passed an adult-use legalization through the ballot box in November 2016. In 2000, Nevada voters passed an amendment to the Nevada state constitution allowing physicians to recommend cannabis for an inclusive set of qualifying conditions including chronic pain and created a limited non-commercial medical cannabis patient/caregiver system. Senate Bill 374, which passed the legislature and was passed by operation of law in 2013, expanded this program and established a for-profit regulated medical cannabis industry.



The Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health licensed medical cannabis establishments up until July 1, 2017 when the state’s medical cannabis program merged with adult-use cannabis enforcement under the Nevada Department Of Taxation. In 2019 Nevada Governor Sisolak established the Cannabis Compliance Board which took over the regulation of cannabis on July 1, 2020. In 2014, Nevada accepted medical cannabis business applications and a few months later the Division approved 182 cultivation licenses, 118 licenses for the production of edibles and infused products, 17 independent testing laboratories, and 55 medical cannabis dispensary licenses. The number of dispensary licenses was then increased to 66 by legislative action in 2015. In 2017 these medical cannabis establishments were able to apply for and obtain retail cannabis licenses of the same type (cultivation, production, laboratory or dispensary). From September 7, 2018 to September 20, 2018 Nevada began accepting retail cannabis store business applications and shortly thereafter in December 2018, the State of Nevada awarded sixty-one (61) retail cannabis store licenses. The application process was merit-based, competitive, and is currently closed. Residency is not required to own or invest in a Nevada medical cannabis business or recreational cannabis business. In addition, vertical integration is neither required nor prohibited. Nevada’s medical law includes patient reciprocity, which permits medical patients from other states to purchase cannabis from Nevada dispensaries. Nevada also allows for dispensaries to deliver medical cannabis to patients.



Each medical cannabis establishment must maintain a medical cannabis establishment registration certificate with the CCB. Among other requirements, there are minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on the geographic location of a medical cannabis establishments as well as restrictions relating to the age and criminal background of employees, owners, officers and board members of the establishment. All employees must be over 21 and all owners, officers and board members must not have any previous felony convictions or had a previously granted medical cannabis registration revoked. Additionally, each volunteer, employee, owner (subject to certain exceptions for owners holding less than 5% of the interests in an entity that holds a cannabis establishment certificate), officer and board member of a medical cannabis establishment must be registered with the CCB as a medical cannabis agent and hold a valid medical cannabis establishment agent card. The establishment must have adequate security measures and use an electronic verification system and inventory control system. If the medical cannabis establishment will sell or deliver edible cannabis products or cannabis-infused products, proposed operating procedures for handling such products which must be preapproved by the CCB.



In response to the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt issued a public statement, pledging to defend the law after it was approved by voters. Former Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval also stated, “Since Nevada voters approved the legalization of recreational cannabis in 2016, I have called for a well-regulated, restricted and respected industry. My administration has worked to ensure these priorities are met while implementing the will of the voters and remaining within the guidelines of both the Cole and Wilkinson federal memos,” and that he would like for Nevada to follow in the footsteps of Colorado, where the U.S. attorneys do not plan to change the approach to prosecuting crimes involving recreational cannabis.



To our knowledge, there have not been any additional statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in Nevada.



 20

 



In determining whether to issue a medical cannabis establishment registration certificate pursuant to NRS 453A.322, the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health or the Nevada Department of Taxation, in addition the application requirements set out, considered the following criteria of merit:




(a) | the total financial resources of the applicant, both liquid and illiquid; 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | the previous experience of the persons who are proposed to be owners, officers or board members of the proposed medical cannabis establishment at operating other businesses or non- profit organizations; 
(c) | the educational achievements of the persons who are proposed to be owners, officers or board members of the proposed medical cannabis establishment; 
(d) | any demonstrated knowledge or expertise on the part of the persons who are proposed to be owners, officers or board members of the proposed medical cannabis establishment with respect to the compassionate use of cannabis to treat medical conditions; 
(e) | whether the proposed location of the proposed medical cannabis establishment would be convenient to serve the needs of persons who are authorized to engage in the medical use of cannabis; 
(f) | the likely impact of the proposed medical cannabis establishment on the community in which it is proposed to be located; 
(g) | the adequacy of the size of the proposed medical cannabis establishment to serve the needs of persons who are authorized to engage in the medical use of cannabis; 
(h) | whether the applicant has an integrated plan for the care, quality and safekeeping of medical cannabis from seed to sale; 
(i) | the amount of taxes paid to, or other beneficial financial contributions made to, the State of Nevada or its political subdivisions by the applicant or the persons who are proposed to be owners, officers or board members of the proposed medical cannabis establishment; and
(j) | any other criteria of merit that the Division determines to be relevant. 




A medical cannabis registration certificate expires one year after the date of issuance and may be renewed upon resubmission of the application information to the CCB and a payment of the renewal fee.



Governor Sisolak has signed multiple Assembly Bills and Senate Bills having to do with or affecting both retail and medical aspects in the cannabis industry. Specifically, Senate Bill 430 effects the medical cannabis industry, amending NRS 453A.050, to further expand the definition of chronic or debilitating medical condition as it is defined in relation to the medical use of cannabis. The new definition includes: an anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorder, autoimmune disease, dependence upon opioids, anorexia, medical condition related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a neuropathic condition. The applicable sections of Nevada Revised Statutes continues to protect a person who holds a valid registry identification card or letter of approval from state prosecution for possession, delivery and production of cannabis.



Adult-Use Retail Cannabis Program



The sale of cannabis for adult-use in Nevada was approved by ballot initiative on November 8, 2016. Nevada Revised Statute 453D required the NV DOT to begin receiving applications for the licensing of cannabis establishments on or before January 1, 2018. Title 56 of Nevada Revised Statutes and Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulations (NCCR)exempts a person who is 21 years of age or older from state or local prosecution for possession, use, consumption, purchase, transportation or cultivation of certain amounts of cannabis.



In February 2017, the Nevada Department of Taxation announced plans to issue “early start” recreational cannabis establishment licenses in the summer of 2017. Beginning on July 1, 2017, these licenses allowed cannabis establishments holding both a retail cannabis store and dispensary license to sell their existing medical cannabis inventory as either medical or adult-use cannabis. Starting July 1, 2017, medical and adult-use cannabis have incurred a 15% excise tax on the first wholesale sale (calculated on the fair market value) and adult-use cannabis have incurred an additional 10% special retail cannabis sales tax in addition to any general state and local sales and use taxes. Effective July 1, 2019, revenue collected from the 10% excise tax on retail cannabis stores is deposited into the State Distributive School Account in the State General Fund.



 21

 



On July 1, 2020, portions of Assembly Bill 533 went into effect. Among the provisions of AB 533 that went into effect are any person who owns more than five percent (5%) ownership interest in a cannabis establishment has to obtain a cannabis establishment agent registration card for a cannabis executive and person who owns less than five percent (5%) must either obtain a waiver for the agent registration card requirement or obtain an agent registration card.



On January 16, 2018, the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the NV DOT issued final rules governing its adult-use cannabis program, pursuant to which up to sixty-six (66) permanent adult-use cannabis dispensary licenses were to be issued. That application period occurred in September 2018 and there is ongoing litigation relating to that licensing process that is currently pending appeal through Nevada’s state courts.



Under Nevada’s adult-use cannabis law, the CCB licenses and regulates cannabis cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities, distributors, retail stores and testing facilities. After merging medical and adult-use cannabis regulation and enforcement into the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Department of Taxation in 2017, Governor Sisolak has now created the single regulatory agency known as the “Cannabis Compliance Board” that took over the regulation of the program on July 1, 2020. For the first 18 months of retail cannabis starting in 2017, applications to the Department for adult-use establishment licenses were only accepted from existing medical cannabis establishment certificate holders and existing liquor distributors for the adult-use distribution license, but in September 2018 applications for retail cannabis stores were accepted and conditional licenses were issued in December 2018. In enforcing the new regulations, the CCB has filed formal complaints against several licensees for various violations of the NCCRs. The CCB has sought significant monetary penalties, and suspension or revocation of certain cannabis licenses.



There are five types of retail cannabis establishment licenses under Nevada’s retail cannabis program:




1. | Cultivation Facility - licensed to cultivate (grow), process, and package cannabis; to have cannabis tested by a testing facility; and to sell cannabis to retail cannabis stores, to cannabis product manufacturing facilities, and to other cultivation facilities, but not to consumers.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Distributor - licensed to transport cannabis from a cannabis establishment to another cannabis establishment. For example, from a cultivation facility to a retail store.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Product Manufacturing Facility - licensed to purchase cannabis; manufacture, process, and package cannabis and cannabis products; and sell cannabis and cannabis products to other product manufacturing facilities and to retail cannabis stores, but not to consumers. Cannabis products include things like edibles, ointments, and tinctures.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Testing Facility - licensed to test cannabis and cannabis products, including for potency and contaminants.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Retail Store - licensed to purchase cannabis from cultivation facilities, cannabis and cannabis products from product manufacturing facilities, and cannabis from other retail stores; can sell cannabis and cannabis products to consumers.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The NV DOT conducted public consultation and received public comments on the Revised Proposed Adult-Use Marijuana Regulation (LCB File No. R092-17) dated December 13, 2017 (the “Nevada Adult-Use Regulation”). On February 27, 2018, the NV DOT adopted the Nevada Adult-Use Regulations and the NV DOT began accepting applications for adult-use cannabis registration certificates shortly thereafter. In December of 2018, the Department of Taxation awarded 61 conditional retail cannabis store licenses throughout the State of Nevada. There is ongoing litigation regarding the issuance of these licenses.



In determining who shall receive a license for a retail cannabis store in response to the request for applications made pursuant to NAC 453D.260, the Department ranked the applications in order from first to last based on compliance with NAC 453D and chapter 453D of NRS and on the following content:




a. | Whether the owners, officers or board members have experience operating another kind of business that has given them experience which is applicable to the operation of a cannabis establishment;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | The diversity of the owners, officers or board members of the proposed cannabis establishment;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | The educational achievements of the owners, officers or board members of the proposed cannabis establishment;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


d. | The financial plan and resources of the applicant, both liquid and illiquid;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


e. | Whether the applicant has an adequate integrated plan for the care, quality and safekeeping of cannabis from seed to sale;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




 22

 




f. | The amount of taxes paid and other beneficial financial contributions, including, without limitation, civic or philanthropic involvement with this State or its political subdivisions, by the applicant or the owners, officers or board members of the proposed cannabis establishment;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


g. | Whether the owners, officers or board members of the proposed cannabis establishment have direct experience with the operation of a medical cannabis establishment or cannabis establishment in this State and demonstrated a record of operating such an establishment in compliance with the laws and regulations of this State for an adequate period of time to demonstrate success;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


h. | The experience of key personnel that the applicant intends to employ in operating the type of cannabis establishment for which the applicant seeks a license; and
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i. | Any other criteria that the Department determines to be relevant.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------




In response to the ever-changing cannabis industry, Governor Sisolak has signed Assembly Bills: 132, 466, and 533 along with Senate Bills: 346, and 545, amongst others, all relating to the cannabis industry in the State of Nevada.



Assembly Bill 132, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, provides that it is unlawful for an employer to refuse/fail to hire a prospective employee who submitted to a drug test and the results showed a presence of cannabis. AB 132 does not apply to persons applying to be a firefighter or medical tech, whom operates a motor vehicle or a person whose employment affects the safety of others.



Assembly Bill 466 requires the creation of a pilot program to facilitate certain financial transactions relating to cannabis. AB 466 began on October 1, 2019 and is set to expire, by limitation, on June 23, 2023. The goals of AB 466 are to give cannabis establishments a financial institution that will allow them to continue to strive towards reducing the risk to the safety and welfare of the public that is seen when large sums of cash are present, provide cannabis establishments with a safe way to pay taxes, prevent revenue from going to criminal enterprises and prevent the distribution of cannabis to minors. AB 466 has built in reporting provisions which state that the State Treasurer shall submit to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau a report about the pilot program before December 1, 2020 and every six (6) months thereafter. The Nevada legislature meets every two years and convened on February 1, 2021. Although it is impossible to predict with certainty, we anticipate that due to the heavy lobbying efforts by the cannabis industry that there will be several cannabis related issues addressed during the 2021 legislative session. Some issues that may be addressed at the session that could impact our business activities involve transfers of ownership in publicly traded companies and the issuance of securities by publicly traded companies.



Assembly Bill 533 was approved by Governor Sisolak on June 12, 2018. Included in AB 533 is Section 52 which calls for the creation of the Cannabis Advisory Commission (CAM) and the Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB). Any reference to NV DOT and the need for NV DOT approval discussed herein, now means that CCB approval is required. The CAM shall be comprised of Officers and Members appointed by the Governor. The purpose of the CAM is to study issues and make recommendations to the CCB in regard to cannabis regulations. Additionally, the CAM will recommend to the CCB any guidelines, rules or regulations or changes to existing ones. Furthermore, the CAM will study the distribution of licenses, emerging technologies for collecting data and recommend to the board any statutory changes that the Commission determines to be appropriate. The CCB was created as a part of Section 54 of Assembly Bill 533. AB 533 calls for the authority to license and regulate persons and establishments involved in the cannabis industry in this State to be transferred to the Cannabis Compliance Board. The CCB consists of five (5) members appointed by Governor Sisolak. The Nevada legislature modeled the CCB after the successful Nevada Gaming Control Board. The CCB licenses, registers and regulates cannabis establishments and those who are engaged in the production and/or sale of cannabis and cannabis products. Additionally, section 65 of AB 533 outlines the procedures by which the CCB can adopt regulations and provides the procedure by which the Legislative Commission can review those regulations. Among other things, the CCB regulates ownership of cannabis companies and requires approvals of and regulatory filings by certain owners of cannabis companies, which requirements remain subject to change and interpretation. There is a major private equity fund that has invested in us, and we recently learned that the CCB is requiring an officer of that fund to make a submission to it and be vetted by it. This submission is now in process. Section 57 of AB 533 outlines that the CCB can perform certain audits of the accounts, programs, funds, activities, and functions of the licensees or they are authorized to require the Department of Taxation to do so. Section 68 provides the procedures for disciplinary actions if a cannabis establishment violates any provision or has an unsatisfactory audit.

Section 178 of Assembly Bill 533 went into effect on July 1, 2020 further expands on the concept that a person who is 21 years of age or older is exempt from state prosecution for:




A. | The possession, delivery or production of cannabis;
---+----------------------------------------------------


B. | The possession or delivery of paraphernalia;
---+---------------------------------------------


C. | Aiding and abetting another in the possession, delivery or production of cannabis;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


D. | Aiding and abetting another in the possession or delivery of paraphernalia;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


E. | Any combination of the acts described in paragraphs (a) to (d), inclusive; and
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


F. | Any other criminal offense in which the possession, delivery or production of cannabis or the possession or delivery of paraphernalia is an element.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The legislative intent behind Section 178 is to provide protections for persons and establishments engaged in certain actions relating to the adult use of cannabis. Section 178 extends the provision of no state prosecution to persons being in the presence or vicinity of the adult use of cannabis in accordance with the provisions of this title.



In addition to the Assembly Bills passed, Governor Sisolak also passed various Senate Bills related to the cannabis industry. As mentioned below in Training, Senate Bill (SB) 346 allows for an independent contractor to enter into a contract to provide training of medical cannabis establishment and cannabis establishment agents.



Senate Bill 430 amends NRS 453A.050 to further expand the definition of chronic or debilitating medical condition as it is defined in relation to the medical use of cannabis. The new definition includes: an anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorder, autoimmune disease, dependence upon opioids, anorexia, medical condition related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a neuropathic condition. As mentioned previously, NRS 453A.050 continues to protect a person lawfully consuming medical cannabis from state prosecution for the possession, delivery or production of cannabis.



Nevada Licenses and Regulations 



In the state of Nevada, only cannabis that is grown or produced in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state.

Reporting Requirements



The state of Nevada uses a computerized track and trace system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems, are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. See section entitled “Compliance with Applicable State Law in the United States” below.)



Storage and Security



To ensure the safety and security of cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products, Nevada state law requires the following:

(a) | be an enclosed, locked facility; 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | have a single secure entrance; 
(c) | train employees in security measures and controls, emergency response protocol, confidentiality requirements, safe handling of equipment, procedures for handling products, as well as the differences in strains, methods of consumption, methods of cultivation, methods of fertilization and methods for health monitoring;

a. | devices that detect unauthorized intrusion which may include a signal system; and
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | exterior lighting to facilitate surveillance;
---+----------------------------------------------


(e) | electronic monitoring must be in place, which includes:
----+--------------------------------------------------------

Training



In accordance with SB 346, an independent contractor is authorized to enter into a contract to provide training of medical cannabis establishment agents and cannabis establishment agents. The independent contractor is required to submit a plan to the CCB describing the manner their training will be conducted.
Transportation



In Nevada, cannabis may only be transported from a licensed cultivation or production facility by a licensed cannabis distributor. Prior to transporting the cannabis or cannabis products, the distributor must complete a trip plan which includes: the agent name and registration number providing and receiving the cannabis; the date and start time of the trip; a description, including the amount, of the cannabis or cannabis products being transported; and the anticipated route of transportation.



During the transportation of cannabis or cannabis products, the licensed cannabis distributor agent must: (a) carry a copy of the trip plan with him or her for the duration of the trip; (b) have his or her cannabis establishment agent card in his or her immediate possession; (c) use a vehicle without any identification relating to cannabis and which is equipped with a secure lockbox or locking cargo area which must be used for the sanitary and secure transportation of cannabis, or cannabis products; (d) have a means of communicating with the cannabis establishment for which he or she is providing the transportation; and (e) ensure that all cannabis or cannabis products are not visible. After transporting cannabis or cannabis products, a licensed cannabis distributor agent must enter the end time of the trip and any changes to the trip plan that was completed.



Each licensed cannabis distributor agent transporting cannabis or cannabis products must report any: (a) vehicle accident that occurs during the transportation to a person designated by the cannabis distributor to receive such reports within two (2) hours after the accident occurs; and (b) loss or theft of cannabis or cannabis products that occurs during the transportation to a person designated by the cannabis distributor to receive such reports immediately after the cannabis establishment agent becomes aware of the loss or theft. A cannabis distributor that receives a report of loss or theft pursuant to this paragraph must immediately report the loss or theft to the appropriate law enforcement agency and to the CCB. The distributor must report any unauthorized stop that lasts longer than two (2) hours to the CCB.



A cannabis distributor shall maintain the required documents and provide a copy of the documents required to the CCB for review upon request. Each cannabis distributor shall maintain a log of all received reports.



Employees of licensed cannabis distributors, including drivers transporting cannabis and cannabis products, must be 21 years of age or older and must obtain a valid cannabis establishment agent registration card issued by the CCB. If a cannabis distributor is co-located with another type of business, all employees of co-located businesses must have cannabis establishment agent registration cards unless the co-located business does not include common entrances, exits, break room, restrooms, locker rooms, loading docks, and other areas as are expedient for business and appropriate for the site as determined and approved by CCB inspectors. While engaged in the transportation of cannabis and cannabis products, any person that occupies a transport vehicle when it is loaded with cannabis or cannabis products must have their physical cannabis establishment agent registration card in their possession.



All drivers must carry in the vehicle valid driver’s insurance at the limits required by the State of Nevada and the CCB. All drivers must be bonded in an amount sufficient to cover any claim that could be brought, or disclose to all parties that their drivers are not bonded. Cannabis establishment agent registration cardholders and the licensed cannabis distributor they work for are responsible for the cannabis and cannabis product once they take control of the product and leave the premises of the cannabis establishment.



 26

 



There is no load limit on the amount or weight of cannabis and cannabis products that are being transported by a licensed cannabis distributor. Cannabis distributors are required to adhere to CCB regulations and those required through their insurance coverage. The motor vehicle which a cannabis distributor uses to transport cannabis shall be equipped with an audible car alarm. When transporting by vehicle, cannabis and cannabis product must be in a lockbox or locked cargo area. A trunk of a vehicle is not considered secure storage unless there is no access from within the vehicle and it is not the same key access as the vehicle. Live plants can be transported in a fully enclosed, windowless locked trailer or secured area inside the body/compartment of a locked van or truck so that they are not visible to the outside. If the value of the cannabis and cannabis products being transported by vehicle is in excess of $25,000 (the insured fair market value per the shipping manifest), the transporting vehicle will have no less than two (2) of the cannabis distributor’s cannabis establishment agent registration cardholders involved in the transportation. All cannabis and cannabis product must be tagged for purposes of inventory tracking with a unique identifying label as required by the CCB and remain tagged during transport. This unique identifying label should be similar to the stamp for cigarette distribution. All cannabis and cannabis products when transported by vehicle must be transported in sealed packages and containers and remain unopened during transport. All cannabis and cannabis product transported by vehicle should be inventoried and accounted for in the inventory tracking system. Loading and unloading of cannabis and cannabis products from the transporting vehicle must be within view of existing video surveillance systems prior to leaving the origination location. Security requirements are required for the transportation of cannabis and cannabis products.



Oasis LLC Licenses



Oasis is licensed to operate in the City of Las Vegas as a Dual Use Marijuana Business and in the State of Nevada as a Medical Cannabis Dispensary Establishment and a Retail Cannabis Store. City Trees Production is licensed to operate in the state of Nevada as a Medical Cannabis Production Establishment, a Retail Cannabis Product Manufacturing facility and a Retail Cannabis Distributor. City Trees Production is licensed to operate in the state of Nevada as a Medical Cannabis Cultivation Facility and a Retail Cannabis Cultivator. The table below lists the licenses issued to the Oasis LLCs in respect of the Oasis LLCs’ operations in Nevada (including municipal licenses). Under applicable laws, the licenses permit the Oasis LLCs to cultivate, manufacture, process, package, sell, and purchase cannabis pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the NV DOT and CCB under the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (“NRS”) sections 678A, 678B, 678C and 678D and the associated sections of the Nevada Administrative Code, CCB regulations and local regulations pertaining to cannabis businesses. All licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at the Oasis LLCs’ facilities in Nevada.



All cannabis establishments must register with the CCB. If applications contain all required information and after vetting by officers, establishments may be issued a cannabis license or medical cannabis establishment registration certificate only during an open application period. In a local governmental jurisdiction that issues business licenses, the issuance by the CCB of a cannabis license or medical cannabis establishment registration certificate is considered provisional or conditional until the local government has issued a business license for operation and the establishment is in compliance with all applicable local governmental ordinances. Final licenses and registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. Renewal requests are typically communicated through email or mailings from the CCB and include a renewal form or application. The renewal periods serve as an update for the CCB on the licensee’s status. Maintaining the licenses in good standing is critical to the success of a cannabis business in Nevada. Failure to adhere to the regulations can result in significant fines and penalties, including the suspension or revocation of the license.



The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at Oasis LLC facilities. The table below lists the licenses issued to the Oasis LLCs in respect of their operations in Nevada.

Nevada Reporting Requirements



The state of Nevada uses METRC as the state’s computerized T&T system for seed-to-sale. Individual licensees whether directly or through third-party integration systems are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. The Oasis LLCs have designated an in-house computerized seed to sale software that integrate with METRC via API (GreenBits), which captures the required data points for cultivation, manufacturing and retail as required in Nevada Revised Statutes and by the NCCRs.

Compliance with Applicable State Law in the United States



We, via the Oasis LLCs, are classified as having a “direct” involvement in the U.S. cannabis industry and are in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the state of Nevada. Neither the Company nor the Oasis LLCs are subject to any citations or notices of violation with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by each applicable U.S. state which may have an impact on its licenses, business activities or operations.



We have in place a detailed compliance program overseen and maintained by external state and local regulatory/compliance counsel. Our internal compliance team (consisting of managers for each respective business unit) implements the compliance program.



Our internal compliance team oversees training for all employees, including on the following topics:




● | compliance with state and local laws 
--+--------------------------------------------
● | safe cannabis use 
● | dispensing procedures 
● | security and safety policies and procedures
● | inventory control 
● | quality control 
● | transportation procedures 




Our compliance program emphasizes security and inventory control to ensure strict monitoring of cannabis and inventory from delivery by a licensed distributor to sale or disposal. Only authorized, properly trained employees are allowed to access the Company’s computerized seed-to-sale system.



Our internal compliance team, together with external state and local regulatory/compliance counsel, monitors all compliance notifications from the regulators and inspectors in each market, timely resolving any issues identified. We keep records of all compliance notifications received from the state regulators or inspectors and how and when the issue was resolved.



Further, we have created comprehensive standard operating procedures that include detailed descriptions and instructions for receiving shipments of inventory, inventory tracking, recordkeeping and record retention practices related to inventory, as well as procedures for performing inventory reconciliation and ensuring the accuracy of inventory tracking and recordkeeping. We maintain accurate records of our inventory at all licensed facilities. Adherence to our standard operating procedures is mandatory and ensures that our operations are compliant with the rules set forth by the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses and other requirements. We ensure adherence to standard operating procedures by regularly conducting internal inspections and ensure that any issues identified are resolved quickly and thoroughly.



In January 2018, former United States Attorney General, Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum and thereby created a vacuum of guidance for enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice.1 As an industry best practice, despite the recent rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the Company continues to do the following to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:




● | Ensure the operations of its subsidiaries are compliant with all licensing requirements that are set forth with regards to cannabis operation by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions. To this end, the Company retains appropriately experienced legal counsel to conduct the necessary due diligence to ensure compliance of such operations with all applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the Company only works through licensed operators, which must pass a range of requirements, adhere to strict business practice standards and be subjected to strict regulatory oversight whereby sufficient checks and balances ensure that no revenue is distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; and 
● | we conduct reviews of products and product packaging to ensure that the products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.

 29

 



We, together with external state and local regulatory/compliance counsel, will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with our compliance program and standard operating procedures. While our operations are in material compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements, such activities remain illegal under United States federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in the “Risk Factors” section below, there are significant risks associated with the business of the Company. Readers are strongly encouraged to carefully read all of the risk factors contained in the “Risk Factors” section below.



Although state-licensed businesses engaged in such activities are currently proceeding largely free from federal prosecution and recently-enacted federal spending legislation prohibits the Department of Justice from using federal funds to prevent states from implementing their own cannabis laws, changes in congress or in the executive administration, including presidential elections, could result in changes to current federal enforcement policies regarding cannabis-related activities which are legal under certain state laws. Therefore, by operating the business, we will face the possibility of civil and criminal sanctions.



Additionally, certain states in which we seek to operate may prohibit non-resident companies from conducting business directly in the state. In such states, we will seek to enter into a collaborative arrangement with a local entity holding the necessary licensure, whereby we will agree to lease our facilities, equipment and employees to the licensed entity in exchange for a fee. Such an arrangement may be difficult to secure and/or expensive to maintain, as we will be reliant on the licensee to maintain its license in order to continue operations. Further, various state and local licensure application and approval processes may require significant time and expense, and, upon becoming authorized to do business in a state, it may be difficult or expensive for us to comply with the oft-changing laws, regulations and licensure requirements of each state and municipality where we are doing business.



We will need to obtain applicable state licenses in each state in which we will operate processing facilities. License requirements and procedures vary from state to state. The initial state in which we operate is Nevada.
