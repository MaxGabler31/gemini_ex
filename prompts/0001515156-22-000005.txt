Item 1. Business
General
ADA-ES, Inc. ("ADA"), a Colorado corporation, was incorporated in 1997. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, effective July 1, 2013, Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. ("ADES"), a Delaware company incorporated in 2011, succeeded ADA as the publicly-held corporation and ADA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADES. In 2018, we acquired ADA Carbon Solutions, LLC ("Carbon Solutions") as a means to enter into the broader activated carbon ("AC") market and to expand our product offerings in the mercury control industry and other applicable activated carbon markets. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is referred to as the "Form 10-K" or the "Report." As used in this Report, the terms the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" means ADES and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
We sell consumable products that utilize AC and chemical-based technologies to a broad range of customers, including coal-fired utilities, industrials, water treatment plants and other diverse markets. Our proprietary technologies and associated product offerings provide purification solutions to enable our customers to reduce certain contaminants and pollutants to meet the challenges of existing and potential future regulations.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we held equity interests of 42.5% and 50.0% in Tinuum Group, LLC ("Tinuum Group") and Tinuum Services, LLC ("Tinuum Services"), respectively, which are both unconsolidated entities, and historically have both contributed significantly to our financial position and results of operations. We account for Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services under the equity method of accounting. As a result of the expiration of Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 45 - Production Tax Credit ("Section 45") refined coal tax credit program effective December 31, 2021, both Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services have substantially ceased operations as of December 31, 2021, and Tinuum Group is in the process of completing reclamation activities. See further discussion below under "Segments - RC" of this item. 
Markets
AC is a specialized sorbent material that is used widely in a host of industrial and consumer applications to remove impurities, contaminants and pollutants from gas, water and other product or waste streams. AC is produced by activating carbonaceous raw materials, including wood, coal, nut shells, resins and petroleum pitch. Properties such as surface area, pore volume, surface chemical functionalities and particle size can be specifically engineered to selectively target various contaminants to meet end-use application requirements. AC can come in several different forms that are important for the end-use application, including powdered activated carbon ("PAC"), granular activated carbon ("GAC"), pellets, honeycombs, blocks or cloths. 
Key markets include removal of pollutants from coal-fired electrical generation and other industrial processes, treatment of drinking and waste waters, industrial acid gas and odor removal, automotive gasoline emission control, soil and ground water remediation and food and beverage process and product purification. 
Demand for AC products has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven by increasing environmental regulations pertaining to water and air purification, especially in the developed and more industrialized areas of the world. Additionally, we believe environmental issues will continue to drive demand for AC in rapidly developing countries.
We see opportunities and are continuing to pursue diverse markets for our purification products outside of coal-fired power generation, including industrial applications, water treatment plants and other end markets. In addition, we see significant opportunities emerging in the soil, sediment and groundwater treatment markets. Increased environmental attention has been drawn to the monitoring and treatment of heavy metals, organic and inorganic compounds in groundwater to improve overall drinking water quality across North America. Activated carbon, in various forms, has and will continue to play a key role in these remediation efforts.
Segments
Advanced Purification Technologies
In our Advanced Purification Technologies ("APT") segment, our AC and chemical products are used to purify contaminated liquid and gas streams from a variety of industrial sources including coal-fired power plants and waste-water treatment plants, among others. Most of the North American coal-fired power generators installed equipment to control air pollutants, such as mercury, prior to or since the inception of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ("MATS"). However, many power generators need consumable products to complement the operation of installed equipment on a recurring basis to chemically and physically capture mercury and other contaminants. AC has been adopted as the most widely-used technology to capture mercury due to product efficiency and effectiveness and currently accounts for the majority of the mercury control consumables in the North American market. We offer AC and other chemical products and work with customers as they develop and implement a compliance control strategy that utilizes the consumables solutions that fit with their unique operating and pollution control configuration. 
For the purification of water, AC has been used in the treatment of drinking water, wastewater, contaminated soil and groundwater to adsorb compounds causing unpleasant taste and odor and other contaminants. Both industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants have deployed the use of AC in their treatment processes. Groundwater contamination has become a matter of increasing concern to federal and state governments as well as to the public, especially over recent years. The U.S. AC market may see significant growth from water purification markets, especially if future regulations are passed controlling certain chemicals in drinking water. At present, individual states are primarily responsible for the protection of groundwater. The existing technologies for treatment, including removal of the soil for external treatment or landfill, pumping the groundwater above surface for treatment and/or installing treatment trenches or barriers, are expensive and may have complicated life-cycle management requirements. An emerging technology generating increasing interest by site engineering firms and owners is injecting highly engineered ACs into the subsoil, also described as "in situ" treatment, to intercept the contamination plume or to treat the groundwater. In response to this market opportunity, in late 2021, we developed a new Colloidal Carbon Product ("CCP") platform, FluxSorb ISTM, that is currently in the process of or planning stages of in-field testing at multiple contaminated soil and groundwater remediation treatment sites. 
Coal-fired power plants continue to be a significant, though declining, source of electricity in the United States. Demand for our AC products related to coal-fired electricity generation is dependent on the availability and cost of alternative energy sources, such as natural gas, solar and wind energy. We see opportunities to continue pursuing diverse markets for our purification products outside of coal-fired power generation, including industrial applications, water treatment plants and other markets. We believe the Supply Agreement with Cabot, as discussed below, will drive adoption of our AC products by customers in some of those diverse end-markets. 
Sales and Customers
Sales of consumables are primarily made by the Companyâ€™s employees to a range of end customers, including coal-fired utilities, industrial companies, water treatment plants and other customers. Our AC sales are generally made under requirements-based contracts ranging from one to five years. Our chemical product sales are generally made on a purchase order by purchase order basis. Revenues from our top three customers comprised approximately 37% of our consolidated consumables revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Cabot Supply Agreement and Related Agreements
On September 30, 2020, we and Cabot Norit Americas, Inc., ("Cabot") entered into a supply agreement (the "Supply Agreement") pursuant to which we agreed to sell and deliver to Cabot, and Cabot agreed to purchase and accept from us, certain lignite-based activated carbon products ("Furnace Products"). The term of the Supply Agreement is for 15 years with 10-year renewal terms that are automatic unless either party provides three years prior notice of intention not to renew before the end of any term.
We believe the Supply Agreement will continue to provide material incremental sales volume and lower fixed operating costs on a per unit basis for our manufacturing plant located in Louisiana (the "Red River Plant"). Further, the Supply Agreement has expanded distribution of our AC products to additional markets outside of those we have traditionally served.
As a condition to entering into the Supply Agreement, on September 30, 2020, we entered into an agreement to purchase (the "Mine Purchase Agreement") from Cabot 100% of the membership interests in Marshall Mine, LLC (the "Marshall Mine Acquisition"), which owns a lignite mine located outside of Marshall, Texas (the "Marshall Mine"), for a nominal cash purchase price. Immediately after completion of the Mine Purchase Agreement, we independently determined to commence activities to shutter the Marshall Mine, and we will incur the associated reclamation costs as further described below.
In conjunction with the execution of the Supply Agreement and the Mine Purchase Agreement, on September 30, 2020, we entered into a reclamation contract (the "Reclamation Contract") with a third party that provides a capped cost, subject to certain contingencies, in the initial amount of approximately $19.7 million plus an obligation to pay certain direct costs of approximately $3.6 million (collectively, the "Reclamation Costs") over the estimated reclamation period of 10 years. Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, Cabot is obligated to reimburse us for approximately $10.2 million of the Reclamation Costs (the "Reclamation Reimbursements"), which are payable semi-annually over 13 years and inclusive of interest. 
As the owner of the Marshall Mine, we were required to post a surety bond to ensure performance of our reclamation activities under the Surety Bond Indemnification Agreement (the "Surety Agreement"). As of December 31, 2021, we posted a surety bond of $16.6 million. 
On February 1, 2021, we and a subsidiary of Cabot Corporation, Cabot Norit Nederland B.V. ("Cabot Corporation") entered into a five-year supply agreement ("EMEA Supply Agreement") to supply Cabot Corporation with lignite activated carbon products and other proprietary products used for mercury removal in utility and industrial coal-fired power plants in the EMEA market (as defined below). Cabot Corporation will be the exclusive and sole reseller of these products within Europe, Turkey, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and we will have a first right to provide the products to Cabot for sale in the EMEA market.
Competition
Our primary competitors for consumable sorbent products include Cabot (CBT), Calgon Carbon, a subsidiary of Tokyo Stock Exchange listed Kuraray Co., Ltd., Donau Carbon Company, Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. (MEEC) and Nalco Holding Company, a subsidiary of Ecolab Inc. (ECL).
Raw Materials
The principal raw material we use in the manufacturing of AC is lignite coal, which is readily available. We supply 100% of the lignite coal through our ownership of the Five Forks Mine ("Five Forks") to fulfill customer orders. Five Forks is operated for us by Demery Resources Company, LLC ("Demery"), a subsidiary of the North American Coal Company. We may also periodically purchase various ACs to supplement our inventory levels or to produce various products to serve AC certain markets.
We purchase various additives utilized in the production of AC. The manufacturing of AC is dependent upon these various additives that are subject to price fluctuations and supply constraints. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide the necessary additives needed to manufacture our ACs is limited. We purchase these additives through supply agreements or spot purchases with the producers. Supply agreements with these producers are generally renewed on an annual basis.
We also purchase additives that are included in certain chemical products for resale to our customers through contracts with suppliers. The manufacturing of these consumable products is dependent upon certain discrete additives that are subject to price fluctuations and supply constraints. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide the necessary additives needed to manufacture our chemical products are limited. Supply agreements with these producers are generally renewed on an annual basis.
Operations
We own and operate the Red River plant which is located in Louisiana. We also lease land in which operate a manufacturing and distribution facility located in Louisiana. Additionally, we have sales, product development and administrative operations located in Colorado. 
Refined Coal ("RC")
Through December 31, 2021, Tinuum Group provided reduction of mercury and nitrogen oxide ("NOX") emissions at select coal-fired power generators through the production and sale of RC that qualified for Section 45 tax credits. We benefited from Tinuum Group's production and sale of RC from our share of earnings from Tinuum Group's sales or leases of RC facilities to tax equity investors. As noted above, the Section 45 tax credit period expired on December 31, 2021 and both Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services substantially ceased operations as of that date. Tinuum Group is performing reclamation at its RC facilities and, along with Tinuum Services. As such, our earnings and distributions from our RC segment substantially ceased as of December 31, 2021, and this will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position beginning in 2022. See the separately filed financial statements of Tinuum Group included in Item 15 - "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" ("Item 15") of this Report.
Products
Our patented M-45TM and M-45-PCTM technologies (collectively, the "M-45 Technology") are proprietary pre-combustion coal treatment technologies used to control emissions of nitrogen oxides ("NOX") and mercury from coals burned in circulating fluidizer bed boilers and pulverized coal boilers, respectively. 
Our patented CyCleanTM technology, a pre-combustion coal treatment process provides electric power generators the ability to enhance combustion and reduce emissions of NOX and mercury from coals burned in cyclone boilers.
Our patents related to the RC segment are not expected to have significant commercial application beyond December 31, 2021 primarily due to the wind down of Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services as a result of the expiration of the Section 45 tax credit period.
Sales and Customers
Through December 31, 2021 we earned royalties ("M-45 Royalties") under a licensing arrangement with Tinuum Group for those RC facilities that utilized the M-45 Technology to treat coal for the reduction of emissions of both NOX and mercury. With the closure of all of the RC facilities as of December 31, 2021, we will no longer earn M-45 Royalties and the loss of this revenue stream will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position beginning in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, M-45 Royalties comprised 14% of our total consolidated revenues and approximately 296% of our total consolidated operating income. M-45 Royalties are recognized based upon a percentage of the per-ton, pre-tax margin as defined in the M-45 License. 
For 2021 and 2020, we also derived substantial earnings in the RC segment from our equity method investments in Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services. Additional information related to major customers is disclosed in Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Historically, we generated substantial earnings and cash distributions from our ownership in Tinuum Group, which constructed RC facilities that were either leased or sold to tax equity investors who earned Section 45 tax credits for the production and sale of RC to utilities at their respective RC facilities. We referred to these RC facilities as "invested RC facilities." 
RC facilities that produced and sold RC and were not leased or sold, but wholly or partially owned by us or Tinuum Group, were referred to as "retained" RC facilities. Through our direct ownership in retained RC facilities or indirect ownership through Tinuum Group, we earned Section 45 tax credits at retained RC facilities for the RC that was produced and sold to utilities. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we earned $0.4 million and $0.4 million of Section 45 tax credits, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we have cumulatively earned substantial tax credits from certain retained RC facilities, but have not been able to fully utilize them. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" ("Item 8") of this Report for additional information regarding our tax credits and other deferred tax assets.
Through December 31, 2021, Tinuum Services operated and maintained RC facilities under operating and maintenance agreements with owners or lessees of these RC facilities. 
The following table provides summary information related to the Company's investment in Tinuum Group and the related RC facilities as of December 31, 2021 and tons of RC produced and sold for the year ended December 31, 2021:

Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used in our RC products were comprised of non-bromine based halogens. 
Operations
Tinuum RC facilities were located at coal-fired power plants in the U.S. 
Research and Development Activities
We have conducted research and development directed towards product development related to the Supply Agreement and other markets. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred expenses of $0.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
Legislation and Environmental Regulations 
Our products and services, as well as Tinuum Groupâ€™s production and sale of RC, are used for the reduction of pollutants and other contaminants. Legislation and regulation limit the amount of pollutants and other contaminants permitted and may increase the need for our product. Below is a summary of the primary legislation and regulation that affects the market for our products.
U.S. Federal Mercury and Air Toxic Standards ("MATS") Affecting Electric Utility Steam Generating Units
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") final "MATS Rule" went into effect in April 2012. The EPA structured the MATS Rule as a Maximum Achievable Control Technology-based ("MACT-based") hazardous pollutant regulation applicable to coal and oil-fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units ("EGU"), which generate electricity through steam turbines and have a capacity of 25 megawatts or greater, and provide for, among other provisions, control of mercury, control of acid gases such as hydrochloric acid ("HCl") and other Hazardous Air Pollutants ("HAPs"). Approximately 1,260 units in the U.S. were coal-fired EGUs when the rule was enacted. According to our estimates, the MATS Rule sets a limit that we believe requires the capture of 80-90% plus of the mercury in the coal burned in electric power generation boilers as measured at the exhaust stack outlet for most plants. The MACT standards are also known as National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP"). Plants generally had four years to comply with the MATS Rule, and implementation of the MATS Rule is now largely completed. We estimate that 52% of the coal-fired units that were operating in December 2012 when the MATS Rule was finalized have been permanently shut down, leaving approximately 518 units in operation in the U.S. at the end of 2021.
In April 2017, a review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the "D.C. Circuit") of a 2016 'supplemental finding' associated with the cost benefit analysis of the MATS Rule conducted by the EPA was stayed at the request of the Trump Administration. The court case continues to be stayed indefinitely. In May 2020, the EPA reconsidered and withdrew its 2016 "supplemental finding" associated with the cost benefit analysis of the MATS Rule. In this action, EPA found that it was not "appropriate and necessary" to regulate HAPs emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs. However, the EPA expressly stated that the reconsideration neither removed coal- and oil-fired EGUs from the list of sources that must comply with the MATS rule, nor rescinded the MATS Rule, which has remained continuously in effect. ADES joined a number of parties in seeking review of this EPA action before the D.C. Circuit. President Biden identified EPAâ€™s withdrawal of the supplemental finding as one of the actions to be reviewed for conformity with Biden Administration policy, and in February 2021, the Biden Administration moved that the pending judicial review of the supplemental finding withdrawal be held in abeyance. On February 9, 2022, the EPA published a new proposed rule revoking the May 2020 withdrawal of the 2016 supplemental finding and affirming that it is "appropriate and necessary" to regulate HAP emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs, which is currently pending. The D.C. Circuit granted the Biden Administrationâ€™s motion, and this appeal also is now in abeyance. The MATS Rule remains in effect.
State Mercury and Air Toxics Regulations Affecting EGUs
In addition, certain states have their own mercury rules that are similar to or more stringent than the MATS Rule. Coal-fired electricity generating units in the U.S are subject to consent decrees that require the control of acid gases and particulate matter, in addition to mercury emissions. 
U.S. Federal Industrial Boiler MACT
In January 2013, the EPA issued the final set of adjustments to the MACT-based air toxics standards for industrial boilers, including mercury, particulate matter and acid gas emission limits. Existing boilers typically had until January 31, 2017 to comply with the rule. On December 1, 2014, the EPA announced the reconsideration of the industrial boiler MACT ("IBMACT") and proposed amendments to the version published January 31, 2013, representing technical corrections and clarifications. The proposed amendments do not affect the applicability of the final rule.
The EPA estimated that approximately 600 coal-fired boilers will be affected by IBMACT, in industries such as pulp and paper. Our estimates, based on conversations with plant operators, suggest that most of the affected plants have either shut down or switched fuels to natural gas to comply with the regulation.
Effluent Limitation Guidelines
In 2015, the EPA set the first federal limits known as effluent limitation guidelines ("ELGs") on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants. The final rule requires, among other things, zero discharge for fly ash and bottom ash transport water, and limits on mercury, arsenic, selenium, and nitrate from flue gas desulfurization ("FGD") wastewater. In September 2017, the EPA finalized a rule that delayed the original compliance deadlines for certain wastewater streams from November 2018 to November 2020, with the possibility that plants would not need to comply until December 2023 with state approval. In April 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down the EPAâ€™s ELGs that apply to leachate wastewater and "legacy wastewater," and directed the EPA to revise the limits on the levels of toxic metals in those wastewater streams. In November 2019, the EPA proposed to revise the ELGs for bottom ash and FGD wastewater. The final rule, published in the Federal Register on October 13, 2020 and effective on December 14, 2020, does not directly regulate halogens. It does, however, propose to establish a voluntary incentives program for the removal of certain halides. In many 
(though not all) of the proposed treatment options that the EPA is considering, selenium in FGD wastewater would be regulated. Some halogens may impact the effectiveness of biological wastewater treatment systems that are often used for the removal of selenium. On August 3, 2021, the EPA initiated a supplemental rule-making initiative to strengthen certain discharge limits and intends to issue a proposed rule for public comment in Fall of 2022. 
Additional U.S. Legislation and Regulations
In 2015, the EPA finalized rules to reduce greenhouse gases ("GHGs") in the form of the Clean Power Plan ("CPP"), which established guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. Under the CPP, states were required to prepare "State Plans" to meet state targets based on emission reductions from affected sources. The CPP was challenged by multiple states in the D.C. Circuit. The CPP was stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The D.C. Circuit held the CPP litigation in abeyance until April 28, 2017, and dismissed the case once the EPA repealed the CPP in July 2019.
The EPA repealed the CPP and replaced it with the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule, which established guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. ACE also requires states to prepare State Plans and prescribes that they must be based on heat rate improvements at affected plants. Numerous states, power companies and non-governmental organizations challenged the ACE rule in the D.C. Circuit, which vacated the ACE rule on January 19, 2021. On February 12, 2021, EPA stated that neither the ACE or CPP regulations were in place with respect to GHGs for fossil fuel-fired power plants.
International Regulations
There are various international regulations related to mercury control. In Canada, the Canada-Wide Standard ("CWS") was initially implemented in 2010, with increasingly stringent limits through 2020 and varying mercury emissions caps for each province. China and Germany both have limits for mercury emissions that are less stringent than U.S. limits and are typically met using co-benefits from other installed air pollution control equipment designed to control other pollutants. In May 2017, the EU ratified the Minimata Convention on Mercury, triggering mercury control regulations with implementation starting in 2021. Specific emissions limits for dust, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), mercury and particulate matter (PM) are currently being developed guided by the best available technologies reference ("BREF") document for limiting stack emissions and liquid effluents from industrial processes. The BREF conclusions for large coal-fired electricity generating units were adopted by the European Commission in July 2017.
Based on the existing and potential regulations, we believe the international market for mercury control products may expand in the coming years. We believe the EMEA Supply Agreement with Cabot will help facilitate positioning our patent portfolio and existing commercial products in the EMEA region.
Mining Environmental and Reclamation Matters
Federal, state and local authorities regulate the U.S. coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety and the environment, including the protection of air quality, water quality, wetlands, special status species of plants and animals, land uses, cultural and historic properties and other environmental resources identified during the permitting process. Reclamation is required during production and after mining has been completed. Materials used and generated by mining operations must also be managed according to applicable regulations and law. 
The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 ("SMCRA"), establishes mining, environmental protection, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining. Mining operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals from the Office of Surface Mining (the "OSM") or from the applicable state agency if the state agency has obtained regulatory primacy. A state agency may achieve primacy if the state regulatory agency develops a mining regulatory program that is no less stringent than the federal mining regulatory program under SMCRA. The Five Forks Mine operates in Louisiana, which has achieved primacy and issues permits in lieu of the OSM. The Marshall Mine operates in Texas, which has also achieved primacy and issues permits in lieu of the OSM.
Mine operators are often required by federal and/or state laws, including SMCRA, to assure, usually through the use of surety bonds, payment of certain longâ€‘term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs, federal and state workersâ€™ compensation costs, coal leases and other miscellaneous obligations. Although surety bonds are usually noncancelable during their term, many of these bonds are renewable on an annual basis and collateral requirements may change. As of December 31, 
2021, we posted a surety bond of approximately $7.5 million for reclamation of the Five Forks Mine and $16.6 million for the reclamation of Marshall Mine.
Patents 
As of December 31, 2021, we held 83 U.S. patents and 12 international patents that were issued or allowed, 15 additional U.S. provisional patents or applications that were pending, and two international patent applications that were either pending or filed relating to different aspects of our technology. Our existing patents generally have terms of 20 years from the effective date of filing, with our next patents expiring beginning in 2022.
Seasonality of Activities 
The sale of our consumable products depends on the operations of the power generation units and industrial facilities in which the applicable consumables are provided. Power generation is weather dependent, with electricity and steam production varying in response to heating and cooling needs. Additionally, power generating units routinely schedule maintenance outages in the spring and/or fall depending on the operation of the boilers. During the period in which an outage may occur, which may range from one week to over a month, no consumables are used, and our sales may be correspondingly reduced. 
The sale of our AC products for water purification depends on demand from municipal water treatment facilities where these products are utilized. Depending on weather conditions and other environmental factors, the summer months historically have the highest demand for PAC, as one of the major uses for PAC is for the treatment of taste and odor episodes caused by increased degradation of organic contaminants and natural materials in water during the summer.
Safety, Health and Environment
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health, and environmental matters ("SH&E Regulations"). These SH&E Regulations include requirements to maintain and comply with various environmental permits related to the operation of many of our facilities, including mine health and safety laws required for continued operation of the Five Forks Mine.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 139 personnel, 27 in Colorado and 112 in Louisiana, all of which were employed full-time.
