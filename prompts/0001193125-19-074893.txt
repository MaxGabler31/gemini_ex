ITEM 1. | Description of Business
--------+------------------------

Overview 
 BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc., (NASDAQ: BDSI), is a rapidly growing commercial-stage specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to patients living with chronic pain. At our core is a shared passion to make every day a little bit easier for patients and help improve the lives of people living with chronic conditions so they can experience life to the fullest. We have built a portfolio of products utilizing our novel and proprietary BioErodible MucoAdhesive (BEMA) drug-delivery technology, and other drug-delivery technologies to develop and commercialize new applications of proven therapies aimed at addressing important unmet medical needs. We now commercialize in the United States using our own sales force while working in partnership with third parties to commercialize our products outside the United States. We have made it a point to deeply understand the patients journeys and are driven by recognizing the full impact of their condition so we can deliver life-altering solutions. 
Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is evolving with the establishment of our commercial footprint in the management of chronic pain; we seek to build a well-balanced, diversified, high-growth specialty pharmaceutical company. Through our industry-leading commercialization infrastructure, BDSI is executing the commercialization of our existing products. As part of our corporate growth strategy, we have licensed, and will continue to explore opportunities to acquire or license additional products that meet the needs of patients living with debilitating chronic conditions and treated primarily by therapeutic specialists. As we gain access to these drugs and technologies, we will employ our commercialization experience to bring them to the marketplace. With a strong commitment to patient access and a focused business-development approach for transformative acquisitions or licensing opportunities, we will leverage our experience and apply it to developing new partnerships that enable us to commercialize novel products that can change the lives of people suffering from debilitating chronic conditions. 
 Our historical clinical and regulatory development strategy has focused primarily on our ability to use the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDAs, 505(b)(2) approval process to obtain more timely and efficient approval of new formulations of previously approved, active therapeutics incorporated into our drug-delivery technology. Because the 505(b)(2) approval process is designed to address new formulations of previously approved drugs, we believe it has the potential to be more cost efficient and expeditious, with less regulatory approval risk than other FDA-approval approaches. 
 An overview of our products and their therapeutic areas is set out below. 
 Our Company 
 We are a publicly listed company. Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol BDSI. We were incorporated in the state of Indiana in 1997 and reincorporated as a Delaware-based corporation in 2002. 
Chronic Pain 
 Chronic pain is often defined as any pain lasting more than 12 weeks. Whereas acute pain is a normal sensation that alerts us to possible injury, chronic pain persists  often for months or even longer. Chronic pain may arise from an initial injury, such as back sprain, or there may be an ongoing cause, such as an illness. Sometimes there is no clear cause. According to results from the National Health Interview Survey there are over 25 million American adults experiencing daily chronic pain, with over 10 million of these experiencing severe pain. 
Treatment Landscape for Chronic Pain 
 The pain market is well established, with many pharmaceutical companies marketing new formulations of existing molecules, as well as generic versions of older, non-patent protected products. In 2018, according to data from Symphony Health, the market for extended release opioids in the U.S. totaled nearly $4.7 billion in annual sales with 13.8 million prescriptions dispensed. However, prescription volume of long acting opioids declined over 13% in 2018 compared to 2017 amidst wide-ranging efforts to curb misuse, abuse and over use of opioids in order to address the current opioid crisis.

 A number of products are competitors to BELBUCA, including BuTrans®, a transdermal formulation of buprenorphine which also has a generic equivalent available. Other competitors are U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or the DEA, Schedule II opioids such as OxyContin® from Purdue Pharma L.P., or Purdue, and Nucynta® ER from Depomed, Inc./ Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., or Collegium, and multiple generic Schedule II oral opioid formulations, such as morphine, hydrocodone, and fentanyl containing products. Approximately 75% of the retail/mail order prescriptions for long-acting opioids are dispensed as a generic product. 
 Some manufacturers have also formulated Schedule II opioids in abuse deterrent formulations (or ADF). Embeda® from Pfizer Inc., Hysingla® ER from Purdue, Zohydro® ER from Pernix Therapeutics Holdings Inc., MorphaBond ER from Daiichi Sankyo Company, Xtampza® ER from Collegium and Arymo ER from Egalet Corporation, as well as new formulations of OxyContin®, use a variety of technologies that aim to minimize the potential for abuse and misuse. Select abuse deterrent products are playing an increasingly important role in treating patients with chronic pain, while others are experiencing slower than anticipated adoption, leading some manufacturers to reconsider launching an ADF product into the current market. 
 Other manufacturers are working to develop alternative buprenorphine formulations for treatment of acute or chronic pain. In July 2018, the FDA issued a complete response letter for sublingual buprenorphine spray for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain being developed by Insys Therapeutics, Inc., or Insys. Relmada Therapeutics, Inc., or Relmada, is developing an oral, enteric-coated buprenorphine (BuTab) for chronic pain and opioid dependence indications. In December 2015, Relmada announced topline results of a proof-of-concept pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers which showed that the product can be delivered at therapeutic levels through the gastrointestinal route, though the bioavailability remained low. No further development is noted. 
 In addition to product competition, there are other factors that have impacted the market for pain products in general. Opioids continue to garner increased scrutiny based on the growing problem of prescription drug abuse and addiction. There have been an increasing number of actions the FDA and other government agencies have taken to address the problem of opioid abuse and addiction. 
 

 | In July 2012 the FDA approved a class-wide REMS program for the extended release and long-acting opioids. The class-wide REMS program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA falls within the existing class-wide REMS program.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In August 2014, the DEA published in the Federal Register its final ruling moving hydrocodone combination products (such as Vicodin, Lortab, Norco, etc.) from Schedule III to the more-restrictive Schedule II, as recommended by the Assistant Secretary for Health of HHS and as supported by the DEAs own evaluation of relevant data. As a result of the ruling, hydrocodone containing products are now classified in the same category (Schedule II) as morphine and oxycodone.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In March 2016, HHSs Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ,or the CDC, issued guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain. CDC developed and published the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain to provide recommendations for the prescribing of opioid pain medication for patients 18 and older in primary care settings. Recommendations focus on the use of opioids in treating chronic pain. The guidelines advocate use of nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy as first line therapy for chronic pain. When starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians are advised to prescribe immediate-release opioids instead of extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids and to prescribe the lowest effective dosage. Clinicians were directed to reassess patients medication needs when considering doses of 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) or greater and should avoid increasing total daily doses to 90 MME or greater. The availability of the guidelines has resulted in confusion and cautiousness, particularly among primary care physicians, and a reduced willingness to treat patients for chronic pain. A sharp reduction in prescriptions among Primary Care Physicians and an increase among Pain Specialists are evidence of the shift in prescribing and in the dynamics of pain treatment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In June 2017, the FDA requested that Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. remove Opana ER (oxymorphone), from the market based on concerns that the benefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks. This is the first time the agency has taken steps to remove a currently marketed opioid pain medication from sale due to the public health consequences of abuse. The FDAs decision was based on a review of all available post-marketing data, which demonstrated a significant shift in the route of abuse of Opana ER from nasal to injection following the products reformulation. It is anticipated that other steps will be taken to further limit the use, duration dose or availability of certain opioids  particularly those with Schedule II designation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In September 2017, the CDC removed the MME conversion factors for buprenorphine from its online oral MME data file. And in 2018 it included a statement in the MME data file noting Buprenorphine doses are not expected to be associated with overdose risk in the same dose-dependent manner as doses for full agonist opioids.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In December 2018 the Health and Human Services Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force issued a Draft Report on Pain Management Best Practices: Updates, Gaps, Inconsistencies, and Recommendations. The report identifies that one of the barriers in pain management best practices is lack of coverage and reimbursement and understanding of proper usage, limit access to buprenorphine treatment for chronic pain. The draft report then makes
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

recommendations that third-party payors should provide coverage and reimbursement for buprenorphine treatment approaches.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | For 2019, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services adopted a soft edit of 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day for patients, aligning with the 2016 CDC Guideline recommendation.

Opioid Dependence 
 Opioid dependence is a medical diagnosis that is characterized by the inability of an individual to stop using opioids, either prescription opioids such as morphine, hydrocodone and oxycodone, or illicit opioids such as heroin, even when it is in the best interest of the individual to do so. Opioid dependence is a complex medical condition that often requires long-term treatment and care. The treatment of opioid dependence is important to reduce both the associated health and social consequences and to improve the well-being and social functioning of people affected. According to the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2.1 million people in the United States had an opioid use disorder. 
Treatment Landscape for Opioid Dependence 
 Treatment with buprenorphine reduces the typical cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with coming off opioid prescription painkillers and heroin. This allows the individual suffering from an addiction to opioids along with counseling and support  to work toward recovery. On average, treatment lasts a couple months, reflecting relatively high dropout rates, but a significant number of people remain on buprenorphine treatment chronically, with nearly one-quarter of patients still on therapy after nine months. 
 The total U.S. market for buprenorphine containing products for opioid dependence exceeded $3.5 billion in 2018, an increase of 13% over 2017 according to Symphony Health. The market has grown steadily as a result of the rapidly escalating problem of prescription opioid misuse and abuse, a recent resurgence of heroin use, the growing number of physicians treating opioid dependence, and the inclusion of addiction treatment as an essential benefit in the Affordable Care Act. 
 The buprenorphine products currently marketed for the treatment of opioid dependence include Suboxone®, a sublingual film formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone, Zubsolv®, a sublingual tablet of buprenorphine and naloxone, and multiple generic formulations of both buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone tablets. Suboxone® film, the market leader with approximately 65% of total buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions, achieved sales of over $2 billion in the U.S. in 2018 per Symphony Health data. 
 While limited information is available, a sublingual spray formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone is in development from Insys and is currently in Phase I development studies. 
 Breakthrough Cancer Pain 
 According to the National Cancer Institute, there are approximately 14.5 million people in the United States diagnosed with or living with cancer. Cancer patients often suffer from a variety of symptoms including pain as a result of their cancer or cancer treatment. Pain is a widely prevalent symptom in cancer patients, and an estimated 50% to 90% of those with cancer also suffer from what is referred to as breakthrough cancer pain (or BTCP). BTCP episodes have a rapid onset that peaks in three to five minutes and can last several minutes to an hour, and usually occur several times per day. 
Treatment Landscape for Breakthrough Cancer Pain 
 BTCP can be difficult to treat due to its severity, rapid onset and the often unpredictable nature. Physicians typically treat BTCP with a variety of short-acting opioid medications, including morphine and fentanyl. The breakthrough cancer pain market has become increasingly crowded and more competitive in recent years. 
 A number of formulations of fentanyl are available employing a variety of drug delivery technologies, all which provide rapid onset and relatively short duration of action to address the fast onset and short duration of BTCP. The principal competitors had traditionally been Actiq® (fentanyl citrate) oral transmucosal lozenge and Fentora® (fentanyl buccal tablet). In recent years, newer product entries, particularly Subsys® (fentanyl sublingual spray) from Insys, have gained significant market share. Additional

  competitors include the sublingual tablet formulation of fentanyl (Abstral®) and a nasal spray formulation of fentanyl (Lazanda®). In addition, multiple generic formulations of Actiq® are currently available. All of the fentanyl based products are subject to the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program, which was designed to ensure informed risk-benefit decisions before initiating treatment with a transmucosal fentanyl product, and while patients are on treatment, to ensure appropriate use. 
 Despite the increased number of fentanyl-based products approved for the treatment of BTCP, the market has contracted significantly since peaking at almost 120,000 prescriptions in 2014, to less than 30,000 prescriptions in 2018, according to Symphony Health in January 2019. 
 The BEMA Drug Delivery Technology 
 Our BEMA drug delivery technology consists of a small, bi-layered erodible polymer film for application to the buccal mucosa (the lining inside the cheek). BEMA films have the capability to deliver a rapid, reliable dose of drug across the buccal mucosa for time-critical conditions such as breakthrough cancer pain or in situations where gastrointestinal absorption of an oral drug is not practical or reliable, or in facilitating the administration of drugs with poor oral bioavailability. 
 We believe that the BEMA technology permits control of two critical factors allowing for better dose-to-dose reproducibility: (i) the contact area for mucosal drug delivery, and (ii) the time the drug is in contact with that area, known as residence time. In contrast to competing transmucosal delivery systems such as 1) lozenges, 2) buccal tablets and 3) matrix-based delivery systems placed under the tongue or sprayed in the oral cavity, BEMA products are designed to: 
 

 | adhere to buccal mucosa in seconds and dissolve in minutes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | permit absorption without patients being required to move the product around in the mouth for absorption, thus avoiding patient intervariability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | allow for unidirectional drug flow into the mucosa as a result of a backing layer on the side of the BEMA film facing into the patients mouth
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | provide a reproducible delivery rate, not susceptible to varying or intermittent contact with oral membranes; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | dissolve completely, leaving no residual product or waste and avoiding patient removal, and the possibility for diversion or disposal of partially used product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We currently own the BEMA drug delivery technology. 
 Sales and Market Overview of our Products 
 The following table summarizes the status of our marketed products and our current product candidates: 
 

Product/Formulation | Indication | Development Status | Commercial Status 
BELBUCA | Management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate | Approval: U.S. in October 2015; Canada in June 2017 | BDSI markets in U.S. 
BUNAVAIL | Treatment of opioid dependence | Approval: U.S. in June 2014 | BDSI markets in U.S. 
ONSOLIS/BREAKYL /PAINKYL (U.S./E.U./Taiwan trade names, respectively) | Breakthrough cancer pain in opioid tolerant patients | Approval: U.S. in July 2009; Canada in May 2010; E.U. in October 2010 and Taiwan in July 2013 | Partnership with Mylan in all regions except North America, Taiwan and South Korea; partnership with TTY in Taiwan; exploring options for U.S. commercialization
Buprenorphine ER Injection | Opioid dependence and chronic pain | IND submitted December 2016 | Not yet approved for marketing 

 The pharmaceutical industry and the therapeutic areas in which we compete are highly competitive and subject to rapid and substantial regulatory and technological changes. Developments by others may render our BEMA technology, our marketed products 
 
5 


  and any proposed drug products and formulations under development noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors. Technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase. 
 There have been a growing number of companies developing products utilizing various thin film drug delivery technologies. While numerous over-the-counter pharmaceutical products have been brought to market in thin film formulations, few containing prescription products have been introduced in the U.S. Among the products to receive FDA approval are BELBUCA, BUNAVAIL, and ONSOLI (BDSI), Suboxone film (Indivior PLC) and Zuplenz (Midatech Pharma PLC). Companies in the development and manufacture of thin film technologies include LTS, Lohmann Therapie-Systeme AG, ARx, LLC and Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as MonoSol Rx LLC, or Aquestive). In addition, a number of companies are developing improved versions of existing products using oral dissolving, nasal spray, aerosol, sustained release injection and other drug delivery technologies. We believe that potential competitors are seeking to develop and commercialize technologies for buccal, sublingual or mucosal delivery of various therapeutics or groups of therapeutics. While our information concerning these competitors and their development strategy is limited, we believe our technology can be differentiated because the BEMA technology provides for a rapid and consistent delivery, high drug bioavailability and convenient use based on how the BEMA technology adheres to the buccal membrane and dissolves. Our clinical trials across a number of BEMA products have demonstrated that the technology is an effective means of drug delivery that is well tolerated and offers convenience to patients. 
 In 2016, we converted our contract sales force into one employed by us to provide greater flexibility to accommodate future strategic options. Using our own sales force provides us with significantly more control over commercialization efforts and makes us capable of selling our own products in specialty pharmaceutical markets while leaving promotional responsibilities for large primary care audiences and ex-U.S. markets with partners. In 2017 we expanded the sales force territories and further expanded in January and September 2018 to support the commercialization efforts. BELBUCA and BUNAVAIL are currently supported by a field force of approximately 113 sales representatives, thirteen regional sales managers and two area directors. 
 BELBUCA (buprenorphine buccal film), CIII, for Chronic Pain 
 BELBUCA was approved by the FDA on October 26, 2015 for use in patients with pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative options are inadequate. BELBUCA is differentiated from other opioids and has the potential to address some of the most critical issues facing healthcare providers treating chronic pain with prescription opioids  abuse, misuse, addiction and the risk of overdose. As a Schedule III opioid, buprenorphine has less abuse and addiction potential compared to Schedule II opioids such as oxycodone, hydrocodone and morphine. Compared to currently marketed products and products under development, we believe that BELBUCA is differentiated based on the following features: 
 

 | Strong and durable efficacy in both opioid naïve and opioid experienced patients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Schedule III designation by DEA, which indicates less abuse and addiction potential compared Schedule II opioids, which include oxycodone, hydrocodone and morphine;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Published studies have shown that buprenorphines physiologic effects reach a plateau, and this ceiling effect may result in a lower risk of overdose related respiratory depression;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Favorable tolerability with a low incidence of constipation and low discontinuation rate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Flexible dosing options with 7 available strengths
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | Buccal administration to optimize buprenorphine delivery.
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | As prescribers are increasingly being guided to monitor total daily morphine milligram equivalents for their patients taking opioids, the CDC has indicated that buprenorphine doses are not expected to be associated with overdose risk in the same dose-dependent manner as doses for full agonist opioids.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Because of the safety, tolerability and efficacy benefits associated with buprenorphine, we believe that BELBUCA is a clear first-line long-acting opioid for patients with pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative treatments, such as non-opioids or immediate release opioids, are inadequate. 
 In January 2012, we announced the signing of a worldwide licensing and development agreement for BELBUCA (with Endo, which we refer to herein as the Endo Agreement), under which we granted to Endo the exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize BELBUCA for the treatment of chronic pain. On October 26, 2015, we and Endo announced the FDA approval of BELBUCA. BELBUCA became commercially available from Endo in February 2016. Endo reported favorable early healthcare provider feedback and positive patient experience with regards to efficacy, tolerability and the buccal film formulation.

 On December 8, 2016, we announced an agreement with Endo terminating Endos licensing of rights for BELBUCA. This announcement followed a strategic decision made by Endo to discontinue commercial efforts of its branded pain business. Pursuant to the Endo Termination Agreement, we reacquired BELBUCA, which transition became effective on January 6, 2017. 
 Given the greater long-term growth opportunities with BELBUCA, we have transitioned our primary commercial emphasis to BELBUCA. We revised our BUNAVAIL-focused commercial efforts, initially leveraging our existing sales force to capitalize on commercial synergies with BELBUCA. 
 Our sales force is focused on current BELBUCA prescribers and clinicians we believe have the greatest opportunity to be adopters of BELBUCA, such as high prescribers of long-acting opioids, BuTrans and/or HCPs who prescribe short acting opioids around-the-clock for patients with chronic pain. In parallel, we are heavily focused on increasing market access for BELBUCA. As of January 2019, BELBUCA had formulary coverage for more than 88% of commercial lives. Approval rates within the commercial channel remained favorable throughout 2018 at about 80%. In 2018 BELBUCA attained preferred access for over 7.5 million Medicare lives within Humana. BELBUCA continues to have favorable approval rates within other Medicare plans, as we pursue improved access to BELBUCA for the senior population suffering with chronic pain. 
 In 2018, we also made significant improvements in patient access for BELBUCA, resulting in over 100 million commercial lives having preferred access to BELBUCA. BELBUCA total prescriptions in 2018, according to Symphony Health, totaled over 160,000, an increase of 91% over 2017. BELBUCA share of total buprenorphine prescriptions (products for the treatment of chronic pain only) for 2018 totaled 23% versus 12% for the prior year, ending 2018 with a 31% share in December. In addition to a steady increase in BELBUCA prescription volume through 2018, there was also an increase in the use of higher doses of BELBUCA as healthcare providers continued to gain comfort titrating patients to higher optimal doses. In 2018, 36% of BELBUCA prescriptions were for doses of 450 mcg or greater, compared to 33% in 2017. Therefore, the weighted average price per prescription continued to increase in 2018. 
 Canada 
 On July 12, 2017 we announced the signing of a licensing agreement under which we granted the exclusive rights to distribute, market and sell BELBUCA in Canada to Purdue Pharma (Canada). Under terms of the agreement, we were to receive upfront and potential milestones of up to $4.5 million CAD as well as royalties on net sales from Purdue. In January 2018, BELBUCA became commercially available in Canada. In June 2018, Health Canada requested pharmaceutical manufacturers discontinue actively marketing opioids. On January 8, 2019, Purdue terminated the license agreement with us, citing market conditions in Canada. The termination was effective as of March 11, 2019. Given these developments, we are taking steps to discontinue the sale of BELBUCA in Canada. 
Other Regions 
 For commercialization of BELBUCA in other regions outside the U.S. and Canada, we are currently seeking partners with commercial reach and experience in pain management in their respective regions. 
 BUNAVAIL(buprenorphine and naloxone buccal film), CIII, for Opioid Dependence 
 In June 2014, BUNAVAIL was approved by the FDA for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support, and on November 3, 2014, we announced the availability of BUNAVAIL in the U.S. It was initially supported by a 60-person field sales force and a full marketing effort targeting the nearly 5,000 physicians who are responsible for approximately ninety percent of prescriptions for buprenorphine products for the treatment of opioid dependence. The launch was also supported by a complete marketing effort aimed at increasing product awareness including advertising and promotion, direct mail and email, a speakers program and a number of other initiatives to minimize patient access issues, including robust contracting with various payers. 
 In May 2017 we announced that the FDA had approved a Supplemental New Drug Application (known as an sNDA) for BUNAVAIL revising the BUNAVAIL indication to include induction, or the initial process undertaken when a patient is transitioned from the abused opioid responsible for their addiction. BUNAVAIL contains the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine, which binds to the same receptors as opiate drugs but has a higher affinity. Naloone, an opioid antagonist, is included as an abuse deterrent. 
 BUNAVAIL provides an alternative treatment utilizing the advanced BEMA drug delivery technology. BUNAVAIL provides the highest bioavailability of any buprenorphine-containing product for opioid dependence, allowing for effective treatment with half the dose compared to Suboxone® film. Additionally, BUNAVAIL offers convenient and discrete buccal administration and avoids the need for patients to avoid talking and swallowing during administration. BUNAVAIL has demonstrated an excellent tolerability 
 
7 


  profile with a 68% reduction at the end of 12 weeks in the incidence of constipation in a Phase 3 trial in patients converted from Suboxone® sublingual tablets or film to BUNAVAIL. 
 As noted above, in January 2017 with the reacquisition of BELBUCA, we transitioned our primary commercial emphasis from BUNAVAIL to BELBUCA. Our BUNAVAIL efforts are now focused on current BUNAVAIL prescribers and on increasing prescriptions related to current, upcoming and future managed care contracts where BUNAVAIL is placed in a favorable formulary position. We believe that in this structure, and with the increases in our sales force size, we can maintain an appropriate share of voice. 
 ONSOLIS (fentanyl buccal soluble film) for Breakthrough Cancer Pain 
 In July 2009, ONSOLIS was approved for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. ONSOLIS is indicated for the treatment of breakthrough pain (i.e., pain that breaks through the effects of other medications being used to control persistent pain) in opioid tolerant patients with cancer, or BTCP. ONSOLIS provides significant reduction in pain for patients suffering from BTCP in a convenient formulation with a range of doses to allow patients to titrate to an adequate level of pain control. 
 North America 
 In September 2007, we secured an exclusive licensing and supply agreement with Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc, for the commercialization rights for ONSOLIS, under which Mylan was responsible for the sales, marketing and distribution of ONSOLIS in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. ONSOLIS was commercially launched in the United States in October 2009. ONSOLIS was approved by the Canadian regulatory authorities in May 2010 and was the first product approved in Canada for the management of breakthrough cancer pain. Mylan Valeant Pharma Canada Inc., a joint venture between Mylan and Valeant Canada Limited was responsible for promotion of ONSOLIS in Canada. ONSOLIS was launched in Canada in the third quarter of 2011 
 On January 27, 2015, we announced that we had entered into the Assignment Agreement with Mylan to return to us the marketing authorizations for ONSOLIS for the U.S. and the right to seek marketing authorizations for ONSOLIS in Canada and Mexico. On May 11, 2016, we announced the signing of a licensing agreement under which we granted the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ONSOLIS in the U.S. to Collegium. On December 8, 2017, we received a 90-day notice from Collegium regarding the return of the U.S. rights to ONSOLIS from Collegium; which transition went into effect on March 8, 2018. 
 Although we have generated licensing-related and other revenue to date from the commercial sales of ONSOLIS, BREAKYL and PAINKYL, such revenue has been limited to date due to multiple factors, including a highly restrictive Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, imposed by the FDA. 
 On December 29, 2011, the FDA approved a class-wide REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products under a single risk management program. The program, which is referred to as the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl, or TIRF, REMS Access Program, was designed to ensure informed risk-benefit decisions before initiating treatment with a transmucosal fentanyl product, and while patients are on treatment, to ensure appropriate use. The TIRF REMS program was implemented in March 2012. The approved program covers all marketed transmucosal fentanyl products under a single program which will enhance patient safety while limiting the potential administrative burden on prescribers and their patients. Having one common program also ended the disparity in prescribing requirements for ONSOLIS compared to similar products and provided ONSOLIS with the opportunity for retail and inpatient facility access. 
 We are assessing options for U.S. commercialization of ONSOLIS, including the use of our current sales force, or potentially out-licensing the product. Regulatory documentation to qualify an alternate manufacturer was submitted to FDA in June 2018. In October 2018, BDSI received notification of FDAs approval of Tapemark as the new ONSOLIS manufacturer. 
 Europe 
 We initially granted commercialization and distribution rights for ONSOLIS on a worldwide basis (except in South Korea and Taiwan) to Meda AB, a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company based in Sweden that was subsequently acquired by Mylan N.V. (which we refer to herein as Mylan). Mylan secured access to additional markets through acquisition of European businesses from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Since September 2006, we secured an exclusive licensing and supply agreement with Mylan for the commercialization rights for BEMA Fentanyl in the European Union, or E.U., which is being marketed in Europe under the trade name BREAKYL. BREAKYL received marketing authorization from the European regulatory authorities in October 2010 and has been launched in over thirteen European countries including Germany, France and the U.K. . The sales royalties to be received by us will be the same for all Mylan territories as agreed to for Europe. In Europe, multiple formulations of fentanyl have been approved and launched for the treatment of BTCP, including ONSOLIS/BREAKYL, as well as Abstral®, Effentora®, and Instanyl® (intranasal fentanyl spray).

 In 2010, we licensed commercialization rights for ONSOLIS for South Korea and TTY Biopharm Co., Ltd., or TTY, for Taiwan where the product is marketed as PAINKYL. 
 In May 2010, we announced a commercial partnership with Kunwha Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. for the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ONSOLIS in the Republic of Korea known as the Kunwha License Agreement. Those rights were subsequently returned to us due to changes in the market dynamics and the Kunwha License Agreement was terminated on August 31, 2015. 
 In October 2010, a commercial partnership with TTY was announced, providing commercialization rights for Taiwan. This agreement resulted in potential milestone payments of up to $1.3 million (including an upfront payment of $0.3 million) along with royalties based on sales. Milestones were achieved in November 2011 and July 2013 relating to the NDA submission and regulatory approval, respectively, in Taiwan, where the product is marketed under the brand name PAINKYL. TTY launched PAINKYL in Taiwan in 2015. 
 Buprenorphine Extended Release Injection Product Candidate 
 In 2014, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Evonik Corporation (or Evonik) to develop and commercialize a proprietary, injectable microparticle formulation of buprenorphine potentially capable of providing 30 days of continuous therapy following a single subcutaneous injection. Microsphere-based, long acting buprenorphine injection has the ability to change the treatment paradigm in opioid dependence. Such a dosage form has the opportunity to improve therapy compliance through continuous delivery of drug for up to 30 days and addresses challenges regarding patient adherence to long-term buprenorphine treatment, which is critical to successfully manage opioid dependence and the potential for misuse and diversion. 
 As part of the agreement, we had the right to license the product(s) following the attainment of Phase 1 ready formulations. At that point, Evonik could receive downstream payments for milestones related to regulatory filings and subsequent NDA approvals as well as product royalties. Evonik has the exclusive rights to develop the formulation and manufacture the product(s). 
 In 2015, we completed initial development work and preclinical studies which have resulted in the identification of a formulation we believe is capable of providing 30 days of continuous buprenorphine treatment. During a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in November 2015, the FDA requested an additional study to assess the fate of the polymers used in the formulation. In 2016, we completed this study as well as additional preclinical work and other activities to support a planned Phase 1 clinical study. We submitted an Investigational New Drug application (or IND) for this product candidate to the FDA in December 2016 and have completed steps necessary to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study. Subsequently, the agreement has terminated and the options granted therein have expired. We continue to evaluate whether or not to advance this particular program. 
 In terms of potential competition for Buprenorphine ER Injection, there are two products that have recently become commercially available and one that has received tentative approval from the FDA. 
 In May 2016, Probuphine®, a subcutaneous implantable rod containing buprenorphine from Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Braeburn was approved. In December 2012, Titan Pharmaceuticals, or Titan, announced the signing of a license agreement with Braeburn. In May 2018 Braeburn returned the rights to Titan and Titan has subsequently initiated the commercialization of Probuphine® through internal efforts. 
 In November 2017, Sublocade, a buprenorphine extended release injection for subcutaneous use from Indivior was approved. Sublocade is the first once-monthly injectable buprenorphine formulation and was approved for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder in patients who have initiated treatment with a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product followed by dose adjustment for a minimum of seven days. Indivior announced commercial availability of Sublocade March 1, 2018. 
 In December 2018, Brixadi, an extended-release buprenorphine injection from Braeburn was granted tentative approval by the FDA. Brixadi can be dosed weekly or monthly depending upon the dose administered. 
 Additional Overview Information 
 From our inception through December 31, 2018, we have recorded accumulated losses totaling approximately $351.3 million. Our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities, including clinical trial activities for our product candidates, sales, and general and administrative expenses. Ultimately, if we secure additional approvals from the FDA and other regulatory bodies throughout the world for our product candidates or other products or product candidates that we may acquire or in-license in the future, our goal will be to augment our current sources of revenue and, as applicable, deferred revenue (principally licensing fees), with sales of such products or royalties from such sales, on which we may pay royalties or other fees to our licensors and/or third-party collaborators as applicable.

 We intend to finance our commercialization and distribution efforts and our working capital needs primarily through: 
 

 | commercializing our approved products such as BELBUCA and BUNAVAIL;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | partnering with other pharmaceutical companies , to assist in the distribution and commercialization of our products, for which we could expect to receive an upfront payment, milestones and/or royalty payments; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | securing proceeds from public and private financings and other potential strategic transactions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have based our estimates of market size estimates, peak annual sales projections, development costs and similar matters described below and elsewhere in this Report on our market research, third party reports and publicly available information which we consider reliable. However, readers are advised that the projected dates for filing and approval of our INDs or NDAs with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, our estimates of development costs, our projected sales and similar metrics regarding BELBUCA, BUNAVAIL, ONSOLIS, Buprenorphine Extended Release Injection or any other product candidates discussed below and elsewhere in this Report are merely estimates and subject to many factors, many of which may be beyond our control, which will likely cause us to revise such estimates. Readers are also advised that our projected sales figures do not consider the royalties and other payments we will need to make to our licensors and strategic partners. Our estimates are based upon our managements reasonable judgments given the information available and their previous experiences, although such estimates may not prove to be accurate. 
 Key Commercial Licensing Agreements 
 Endo Licensing Agreement for BELBUCA and its Termination 
 On January 6, 2012, we entered into a world-wide licensing and development agreement for BELBUCA with Endo, which was subsequently terminated. Under terms of the agreement, Endo was responsible for the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales of BELBUCA on a worldwide basis. The agreement called for Endo to commercialize BELBUCA outside the U.S. through its own efforts or through regional partnerships. 
 The FDAs approval of BELBUCA triggered a milestone payment to us from Endo of $50 million, of which $20 million had been deferred for future revenue recognition as the payment was contingently refundable in the event a generic product was commercially launched during the patent extension period. As mentioned below, the obligations of this milestone were extinguished upon the closing of the termination agreement. This $20 million was recognized as revenue in January 2017. 
 On December 8, 2016 we announced we had entered into a termination agreement with Endo (the Endo Termination Agreement) terminating Endos licensing of rights for BELBUCA, which transaction closed on January 6, 2017. As a result of the agreement, the world-wide rights to BELBUCA were transferred back to us. 
 At the closing of the transactions by the Endo Termination Agreement we purchased from Endo the following assets (the Assets): (i) BELBUCA product inventory and work-in-progress, (ii) material manufacturing contracts related to BELBUCA, (iii) BELBUCA-related domain names and trademarks (including the BELBUCA trademark), (iv) BELBUCA-related manufacturing equipment, and (v) all pre-approval regulatory submissions, including any INDs and NDAs, regulatory approvals and post-approval regulatory submissions concerning BELBUCA. The purchase price for the Assets (which we refer to as the Asset Purchase Price) was equal to the sum of: (i) the aggregate book value of the portion of the transferred product inventory forecasted to be used or sold by the Company, (ii) the aggregate book value of work-in-progress inventory, and (iii) the assumption of any assumed liabilities. Upon Closing, we accepted transfer of the Assets and assumed and agreed to discharge when due all applicable liabilities assumed by us, which consisted of post-closing obligations for liabilities and payments associated with the Assets, the assumed contracts related to the Assets and applicable taxes (with the obligation for pre-closing and other certain liabilities resulting from the acts or omissions of Endo being retained by Endo). 
 In conjunction with the Endo Termination Agreement, we also entered into a distribution agreement (the Distribution Agreement) with Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or Par) for the distribution of an authorized generic BELBUCA product after the launch of a generic BELBUCA product by a third party. The Distribution Agreement covers distribution within the entire United States, has an initial term of three years after the launch of a generic BELBUCA product by a third party, an initial automatic renewal period of two years, and additional automatic one-year renewal periods thereafter, which will occur unless either party provides written notice of termination an agreed upon period of time prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term. In exchange for distribution rights of the generic product, Par will pay us an agreed upon base purchase price and a deferred purchase price equal to a percentage of profit (as such term is specifically agreed to in the Distribution Agreement) with respect to units of each dosage strength of generic product. During the term of the Distribution Agreement, Par is precluded from manufacturing for sale in the United States, or distributing in the United States, any equivalent product, provided that nothing prohibits Par from continuing or undertaking to develop any equivalent product or selling such equivalent product outside of the U.S. The Distribution Agreement contains customary termination provisions for bankruptcy, withdrawal of product from the market, and regulatory and legislative changes, as 
 
10 


  well as a termination right for insufficient profits or Pars acquisition by or of a party challenging our patents with respect to BELBUCA. 
 Mylan Licensing Agreements for ONSOLIS 
 North American Agreement. On September 5, 2007, we entered into a definitive License and Development Agreement with Mylan and our subsidiary Arius pursuant to which we and Arius agreed to grant to Mylan an exclusive commercial license to market, sell, and, following regulatory approval, continue development of ONSOLIS in the United States, Mexico and Canada (which we refer to as the Mylan North American License). 
 Pursuant to such license agreement, we are to receive the following future milestones: 
 

 | sales milestones equaling an aggregate of $30 million will be payable at:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | $10.0 million when and if annual sales meet or exceed $75.0 million;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | $10.0 million when and if annual sales meet or exceed $125.0 million; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | $10.0 million when and if annual sales meet or exceed $175.0 million.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 European Agreement. In 2006, we announced collaboration with Mylan to develop and commercialize BEMA Fentanyl (marketed as BREAKYL in Europe). Under terms of the agreement, we granted Mylan rights to the European development and commercialization of BREAKYL, in exchange for an upfront fee of $2.5 million and a $2.5 million milestone payment (received in 2008) for completion of Phase 3 clinical trials. Mylan managed the regulatory submission in Europe that led to approval in October 2010. Mylan exclusively commercializes BREAKYL in Europe. 
 In 2009, we received a $3 million payment in exchange for amending the European agreement to provide Mylan the worldwide rights to ONSOLIS, except for South Korea and Taiwan. The sales royalties to be received by us will be the same for all territories as agreed to for Europe. In addition, various terms of the European agreements have been modified to reflect the rights and obligations of both us and Mylan in recognition of the expansion of the scope of the European agreements. 
 On January 27, 2015, we entered into an assignment and revenue sharing agreement with Mylan (which we refer to as the ARS Agreement) to return to us the marketing authorization for ONSOLIS in the U.S. and the right to seek marketing authorizations for ONSOLIS in Canada and Mexico. Under the ARS Agreement, financial terms were established that enable Mylan to share a significant portion of the proceeds of milestone and royalty payments received by us from any new North American partnership for ONSOLIS that may be executed by us. Following the return of the U.S. marketing authorization from Mylan, we submitted a prior approval supplement for the new formulation to the FDA in March 2015, which was approved in August 2016. 
 Collegium License and Development Agreement for ONSOLIS and its Termination 
 On May 11, 2016, we entered into a definitive License and Development Agreement (which we refer to as the Collegium Agreement) with Collegium under which we granted Collegium the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ONSOLIS in the U.S. Under the terms of the Collegium Agreement, Collegium was to be responsible for the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales of ONSOLIS in the U.S. We were obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue the transfer of manufacturing to the anticipated manufacturer for ONSOLIS and to submit a corresponding Prior Approval Supplement (the Supplement) to the FDA with respect to the current NDA for ONSOLIS. Following approval of the Supplement, the NDA and manufacturing responsibility for ONSOLIS (including the manufacturing relationship with our manufacturer, subject to our entering into an appropriate agreement with such manufacturer that is acceptable and assignable to Collegium) was to be transferred to Collegium. 
 Pursuant to such license agreement, we received: 
 

 | $2.5 million upfront non-refundable payment, (received in June 2016); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | reimbursement to us for a pre-determined amount of the remaining expenses associated with the ongoing transfer of the manufacturing of ONSOLIS;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The execution of the Collegium Agreement also required the execution of a definitive termination agreement between us and Mylan embodying royalty-sharing terms, returning ONSOLIS-related assets and rights in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to us, and including certain other provisions. In addition, our royalty obligations to CDC IV, LLC (or CDC IV), an entity that originally provided funding for the development of ONSOLIS, and its assignees will remain in effect. CDC IV provided funding for the development of ONSOLIS in the past. 
 On December 8, 2017, Collegium provided us the required 90-day notice regarding termination of the license and development agreement for ONSOLIS between us and Collegium. Collegiums decision to terminate the license involved their execution of a 
 
11 


  license agreement to commercialize Nucynta® (tapentadol) Immediate Release and Nucynta® ER (tapentadol). The license and development agreement for ONSOLIS between us and Collegium formally ended on March 8, 2018 and we received our assets back from Collegium. 
 Key Collaborative, Supply and Manufacturing Agreements 
 We are and have been a party to collaborative agreements with corporate partners, contractors, universities and government agencies. Our collaboration arrangements are intended to provide us with access to greater resources and scientific expertise in addition to our in-house capabilities. We also have supply arrangements with several of the key component producers of our delivery technology and we rely on third-party manufacturers and packagers to produce commercial product. Our collaborative, supply and manufacturing agreements include: 

 | Mylan. For a description of our agreements with Mylan, please see Mylan Licensing Agreements for ONSOLIS above.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Collegium. For a description of our agreements with Collegium, please see Collegium License and Development Agreement for ONSOLIS above.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | LTS Lohmann Therapie-Systeme AG. Effective December 15, 2006, we entered into a Process Development Agreement with LTS Lohmann Therapie-Systeme AG (which we refer to herein as LTS). Under the agreement, LTS has granted us a license under European Patent No. 0 949 925, regarding BREAKYL in the E.U. Our BREAKYL agreement is renewable for successive terms of two-year terms and shall continue until terminated under the following conditions: i) bankruptcy/insolvency, ii) intellectual property loss, iii) breach of contract iv) supply failure, and v) mutual agreement. LTS manufactures BREAKYL for sale in the E.U. and PAINKYL for sale in the Republic of China (Taiwan). In accordance with the supply agreement executed by us with LTS in April 2012, LTS is the exclusive manufacturer of BEMA Fentanyl for all countries with exception of the United States and Canada. The current term extends to December 31, 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ARx. Effective July 30, 2014, we entered into an agreement with ARx, LLC. Pursuant to which ARx acts as a supplier of BUNAVAIL laminate (bulk product) for the United States. Our supply agreement with ARx was then amended July 14, 2017 and now the agreement runs until December 31, 2023. The agreement can be further renewed for additional terms by mutual agreement.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Effective January 6, 2017, we assumed Endos agreement with ARx to supply BELBUCA laminate (bulk product). This agreement automatically renews for successive terms of one year each and currently covers minimum annual commitments for supply of bulk product through 2023. 
 

 | Sharp. Effective March 6, 2014, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Sharp Corporation, or Sharp, to convert the BUNAVAIL laminate (bulk product) into individual dosage units and package them to supply BUNAVAIL finished product. Our supply agreement with Sharp ran for an initial term from March 6, 2014 until December 31, 2016 and continues to be extended by mutual agreement for subsequent one-year terms. The current term extends to December 31, 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Effective January 6, 2017, we assumed Endos agreement with Sharp which covers exclusive annual commitments for supply of packaged BELBUCA finished product through 2022. 
 

 | Tapemark. Effective January 6, 2017, we assumed Endos agreement with The Tapemark Company, or Tapemark, to convert the BELBUCA laminate (bulk product) into individual dosage units which were then transferred to Sharp for secondary packaging and supply of BELBUCA finished product. Tapemark continued to provide such services for BELBUCA through 1st quarter of 2018 as we transitioned the converting and primary packaging operations for BELBUCA over to an alternate packaging site in 2018. Tapemark remains qualified to conduct converting and primary packaging of BELBUCA and we continue to explore other opportunities to utilize Tapemarks contract manufacturing services going forward.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We initiated a program to qualify Tapemark as an alternate commercial manufacturing site for ONSOLIS. This program was necessary since previous efforts to extend a supply agreement with the original ONSOLIS manufacturer Aveva Drug Delivery Systems, Inc. (subsequently acquired by Apotex) were unsuccessful and the agreement expired. In October 2018, we received notification of FDAs approval of Tapemark as the new ONSOLIS manufacturer. 
 Relationship with CDC IV, LLC 
 On July 14, 2005, we entered into a Clinical Development and License Agreement (the CDLA), with the predecessor of CDC IV, which provided funds to us for the development of ONSOLIS. Under the CDLA, as amended, CDC IV is entitled to receive a low-double digit royalty based on net sales of ONSOLIS. The CDLA includes minimum royalties of $375,000 per quarter beginning in the second full year following commercial launch which came into effect in 2011. The royalty term and minimum payments end upon the latter of expiration of the patent or generic entry into any particular country, or the CDLA is terminated. 
 
12 


 We and CDC IV entered into a Royalty Purchase and Amendment Agreement, dated September 5, 2007 (the RPAA) pursuant to which we granted CDC IV a 1% royalty on sales of the next BEMA product, which was BUNAVAIL, including an active pharmaceutical ingredient other than fentanyl, to receive FDA approval. In connection with the 1% royalty grant: (i) CDC IV shall have the option to exchange its royalty rights to BUNAVAIL in favor of royalty rights to a substitute BEMA product, (which CDC subsequently exchanged for BELBUCA) (ii) we shall have the right, no earlier than six (6) months prior to the initial commercial launch of BUNAVAIL or BELBUCA, to propose in writing and negotiate the key terms pursuant to which it would repurchase the royalty from CDC IV, (iii) CDC IVs right to the royalty shall immediately terminate at any time if annual net sales of BUNAVAIL or BELBUCA equal less than $7.5 million in any calendar year following the third (3rd) anniversary of initial launch of the product and CDC IV receives $18,750 in three (3) consecutive quarters as payment for CDC IVs 1% royalty during such calendar year and (iv) CDC IV shall have certain information rights with respect to BUNAVAIL or BELBUCA. 
 In April 2016, CDC IV exercised its right pursuant to the RPAA to exchange its royalty rights to the next BEMA product which was BUNAVAIL, in favor of royalty rights to the Substitute BEMA product which was BELBUCA (the CDC IV Option). 
 On November 21, 2016 we entered into an Amended and Restated CDLA with CDC IV and Athyrium LLC that did not materially change the rights of the parties under the CDLA, but merely clarified and memorialized in a single agreement the rights and obligations of our company, CDC IV and Athyrium under the CDLA and its various amendments as described above. 
 Licenses, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Information 
 Our intellectual property strategy is intended to maximize protection of our proprietary technologies and know-how and to further expand targeted opportunities by extension of our patents, trademarks, license agreements and trade secrets portfolio. In addition, an element of our strategic focus provides for varying specific royalty or other payment obligations by our commercial partners as our applicable intellectual property portfolio changes or business activity reaches certain thresholds. 
 However, patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical organizations are uncertain and involve complex legal and technical issues. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the breadth of claims in patent cases which results in varied degrees of protection. While we believe that our intellectual property position is sound, it may be that our pending patent applications will not be granted or that our awarded claims may be too narrow to protect the products against competitors. It is also possible that our intellectual property positions will be challenged or that patents issued to others prior to our patent issuance may preclude us from commercializing our products. It is also possible that other parties could have or could obtain patent rights which may cover or block our products or otherwise dominate our patent position. 
 BEMA Technology 
 The drug delivery technology space is congested, although we do not believe that our BEMA products conflict with, are dominated by, or infringe any external patents and we do not believe that we require licenses under external patents for our BEMA based products in the United States. It is possible, however, that a court of law in the United States or elsewhere might determine otherwise. If a court were to determine that we were infringing other patents and that those patents were valid, we might be required to seek one or more licenses to commercialize our products or technologies and we may be unable to obtain such licenses from the patent holders. If we were unable to obtain a license, or if the terms of the license were onerous, there may be a material adverse effect upon our business plan to commercialize these products. 
 On March 1, 2011, we were granted a patent extending the exclusivity of the BEMA drug delivery technology in Canada to 2027. The Canadian Patent No. 2,658,585 provides additional patent protection for ONSOLIS and BELBUCA. In April 2012, the USPTO granted US Patent No. 8,147,866, which will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA drug delivery technology for BELBUCA and BUNAVAIL in the United States from 2020 to 2027. In April 2014, the USPTO granted US Patent No. 8,703,177 (issued from US Patent Application No. 13/590,094), which will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA drug delivery technology for BUNAVAIL in the United States to at least 2032. In February 2018, we were granted US Patent No. 9,901,539, which will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA technology for BELBUCA in the United States to December 21, 2032. 
 We own various patents and patent applications relating to the BEMA technology. US Patent No. 6,159,498 (expiration date October 2016), US Patent No. 7,579,019 (expiration date January 22, 2020), US Patent No. 8,147,866 (expiration date July 23, 2027), US Patent 8,703,177 (expiration date August 20, 2032), US Patent 9,522,188 (expiration date April 24, 2035), US Patent 9,597,288 (expiration date July 23, 2027), US Patent 9,655,843 (expiration date July 23, 2027), US Patent 9,901,539 (expiration date December 21, 2032, Canadian Patent No. 2,658,585 (expiration date July 2027), EP2054031 (expiration date July 2027) and EP 0 973 497 (expiration date October 2017) are of particular value to our business and technology platform relating to the BEMA delivery technology. On February 16, 2010, we filed a complaint with the United States Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, requesting the USPTO be required to further extend the patent term for US 7,579,019 from 835 days to 1,191 days. In March 2011, we 
 
13 


  prevailed in this case, and the patent expiration date of US Patent No. 7,579,019 is now extended from January 31, 2019 to January 22, 2020. 
 On January 22, 2014, Aquestive filed a Petition for Inter Partes Review, or IPR, on US Patent No. 7,579,019 with the USPTO. In the Petition, Aquestive is requesting an inter partes review because it is asserting that the claims of US Patent No. 7,579,019 are alleged to be unpatentable over certain prior art references. The USPTO instituted the IPR on the US Patent No. 7,579,019 (which we refer to as the 019 Patent). The USPTO found all claims patentable and Aquestive filed a Request for Rehearing. On December 19, 2016, the PTAB issued a final decision denying Aquestives request for rehearing. Aquestive did not appeal this final decision. 
 With respect to trademarks, BDSI®, BEMA®, BELBUCA® and BUNAVAIL® are registered trademarks of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. ONSOLIS® and BREAKYL are also trademarks owned by BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. PAINKYL is a trademark owned by TTY Biopharm. 
 Government Regulation 
 The nonclinical and clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of any drug product is subject to significant regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Complying with these regulations involves considerable time, expense and uncertainty. 
 In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous federal regulation and, to a lesser extent, state regulation. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our drugs. Drug development and approval within this regulatory framework is difficult to predict, requires several years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Moreover, ongoing legislation by Congress and rulemaking by the FDA presents an ever-changing landscape where we could be required to undertake additional activities before any governmental approval to market our products is granted. 
 The steps required before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States include: 
 

1. | small scale manufacturing of the product;
---+------------------------------------------


2. | laboratory and nonclinical tests for safety of the product;
---+------------------------------------------------------------


3. | submission of an IND to the FDA for the product (the IND must become effective before human clinical trials can commence);
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | larger scale manufacturing of the product;
---+-------------------------------------------


5. | clinical trials to characterize the efficacy and safety of the product in the intended patient population;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | submission of an NDA to the FDA; and
---+-------------------------------------


7. | approval of the NDA by the FDA.
---+--------------------------------

 In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product, each product-manufacturing establishment must be registered with, and approved by, the FDA. Manufacturing establishments are generally subject to biennial inspections by the FDA and must comply with the FDAs Good Manufacturing Practices and with other federal and local regulations. 
 
14 


 Nonclinical Testing 
 Nonclinical testing includes laboratory evaluations of the active drug substance and formulation, as well as tissue culture and animal studies to assess the safety and potential efficacy of the investigational product. Nonclinical tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA Good Laboratory Practices regulations. Nonclinical testing is inherently risky, and the results can be unpredictable or difficult to interpret. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of clinical trials. Unless the FDA places a clinical hold on an IND, clinical studies may begin thirty (30) days after the IND is submitted. 
 We have relied and intend to continue to rely on third party contractors to perform nonclinical trials. 
 Clinical Research 
 Clinical research involves administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers and/or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices following protocols acceptable to FDA that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy and the planned evaluation of results. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA prior to its conduct. Further, each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board that protects the rights and welfare of the study subjects. The drug product used in clinical trials must be manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices. 
 Clinical research is typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap and not all phases may be necessary when developing investigational products that will utilize the FDAs 505(b)(2) approval process. Phase 1 studies are typically performed in normal healthy volunteers to assess the safety (adverse side effects), absorption, metabolism, bio-distribution, excretion, and food and drug interactions of the investigational drug product. Additional studies may be performed to assess abuse potential as well as limited measures of pharmacologic effect. Phase 2 is the proof of principle stage and involves studies in a limited number of patients in order to: 

 | assess the potential efficacy of the product for specific, targeted indications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | identify the range of doses and dose regimens likely to be effective for the indication; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | identify possible adverse events and safety risks.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 When there is evidence that the product may be effective and has an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to establish the clinical efficacy and safety profile of the product within a larger population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. Phase 3 frequently involves randomized controlled trials and, whenever possible, studies are conducted in a manner so that neither the patient nor the investigator knows what treatment is being administered. We, or the FDA, may suspend clinical trials at any time if it is believed that the individuals participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. 
 New Drug Application and FDA Approval Process 
 The results of the pharmaceutical and manufacturing development work, nonclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA for approval to market and sell the product. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time and effort. In addition to the results of nonclinical and clinical testing, the NDA applicant must submit detailed information about chemistry, manufacturing and controls that will describe how the product is made, packaged, labeled, and tested through the manufacturing process. The manufacturing process continues to develop throughout the period of clinical trials such that, at the time of the NDA, it has been demonstrated that there is control of the process and the product can be made consistently at commercial scale. 
 The NDA review process involves FDA investigation into the details of the manufacturing process, as well as the design and analysis of each of the nonclinical and clinical studies. This review includes inspection of the manufacturing facility, the data recording process for the clinical studies, the record keeping at a sample of clinical trial sites and a thorough review of the results for each nonclinical and clinical study. Through this review, the FDA reaches a decision about the risk-benefit profile of a product candidate. If the benefit outweighs the risk, the FDA begins negotiation with the company on the content of an acceptable package insert and an associated REMS plan if required. 
 The NDA review process is affected by many factors, including the severity of the disease, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Consequently, there is a risk that approval may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed, require additional testing or information, or require post-marketing testing (Phase 4) and surveillance to monitor the safety of a companys product if it does not believe the NDA contains adequate evidence of its safety. Finally, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or health problems are identified that would alter the risk-benefit

  analysis for the product. Post-approval studies may be conducted to explore the use of the product for new indications or populations such as pediatrics. 
 Among the conditions for NDA approval is the requirement that any prospective manufacturers quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to Good Manufacturing Practices and the specifications approved in the NDA. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of quality control and quality assurance to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, also are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by other federal, state or local agencies. Additionally, in the event of non-compliance, the FDA may issue warning letters and/or seek criminal and civil penalties, enjoin manufacture, seize product or revoke approval. 
 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy 
 In March 2008, new legislation designated as the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the FDAAA) took effect. This legislation strengthened the FDAs authority over drug safety and directs the FDA to develop systems aimed at managing the risk-benefit ratio of a drug, with a particular focus on post-approval safety. FDAAA authorized the FDA to require and enforce a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, if the FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the potential risks. The legislation also provides the FDA with authority to require a REMS at any point in a drug products lifecycle based on new safety information. 
 A REMS is defined by the FDA as a strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a drug or biological product. The FDAs assessment of whether to require a REMS as a condition for approval considers factors such as the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition that is to be treated by the drug, the expected benefit, and the seriousness of any known or potential adverse events that may be related to the drug. A REMS may be conveyed through the use of a number of tools including a Medication Guide for distribution when the drug is dispensed, a communication plan to physicians to convey potential risks, and elements to ensure safe use. These elements may include provisions that healthcare providers who prescribe the drug and pharmacists who dispense the drug have particular training, experience or special certifications; that the drug be dispensed only in certain healthcare settings; that the drug be dispensed to patients with evidence of safe-use conditions; and/or that patients must be enrolled in a registry. Under the FDAAA, the FDA has also been granted enforcement authority over violations of the REMS provisions. The FDA may impose civil monetary penalties, the drug or biological product can be deemed misbranded, and/or the FDA may obtain injunctive relief against further distribution of the product. 
 On December 29, 2011, the FDA approved a class-wide REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products under a single risk management program. ONSOLIS is subject to this REMS, which includes a number of Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU). 
 Additionally, FDA has implemented a class-wide REMS covering all opioid analgesic drug products. The class-wide REMS includes a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA is subject to this REMS. 
 A REMS is also in place for buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence. BUNAVAIL is included in this REMS, which includes a medication guide and healthcare professional and patient education. 
 The cost and implementation of all of these shared system REMS is shared among multiple companies that are required to participate by way of having an approved product that is subject to the particular REMS. 
 International Approval 
 Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the drug in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and drug approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for certain European countries, in general, each country currently has its own procedures and requirements. 
 BELBUCA is approved in Canada, and ONSOLIS (under different trade names and with a slightly different formulation) is approved in Europe and in Taiwan. 
 Other Regulation 
 In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to United States regulation under the Controlled Substances Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state, local or similar foreign regulations. Our research

  and development may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of any accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. 
 Research and Development 
 Most of our research and development relating to our BEMA and other technologies has been conducted through third parties in collaboration with us. 
 Research and development expenses have historically consisted of product development expenses incurred in identifying, developing and testing product candidates. Product development expenses consist primarily of labor, benefits and related employee expenses for personnel directly involved in product development activities; fees paid to professional service providers for monitoring and analyzing clinical trials; regulatory costs; costs of contract research and manufacturing of inventory used in testing and clinical trials. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we spent approximately $4.9 million, $13.0 million and $18.9 million, respectively, on research and development, and such expenses represented approximately 8%, 18% and 28%, respectively, of our total operating expenses for such fiscal years. 
Employees 
 As of March 14, 2019, we have 164 full-time employees. 127 handle our outside sales and training, thirteen are involved in our medical affairs, clinical development program and operations, seventeen handle our administration, accounting, and supply chain management and seven handle our marketing and managed markets. Advanced degrees and certifications of our staff include one Ph.D, one M.D, three PharmDs, two CPAs, eighteen MBAs, seven MSs, five MAs, one JD, one MPA, one MEDU and one RN. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. From time to time, we also employ independent contractors on a consulting basis or to support our administrative functions. We consider relations with all our employees to be good. Each of our employees has entered into confidentiality, intellectual property assignment and non-competition agreements with us.
