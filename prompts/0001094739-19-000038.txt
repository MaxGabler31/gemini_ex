Overview
We are a global technology leader in optical communications, providing components and subsystems to networking equipment manufacturers, data center operators, telecom service providers, consumer electronics and automotive companies. We design products that meet the increasing demands for network bandwidth, data storage and 3D sensing subsystems. Our optical subsystems consist primarily of transmitters, receivers, transceivers, transponders and active optical cables, which provide the fundamental optical-electrical, or optoelectronic interface for interconnecting the electronic equipment used in these networks, including the switches, routers, and servers used in wireline networks as well as the antennas and base stations used in wireless networks. These products rely on the use of semiconductor lasers and photodetectors in conjunction with integrated circuits and novel optoelectronic packaging to provide a cost-effective means for transmitting and receiving digital signals over fiber optic cable at speeds ranging from less than 1 gigabit per second, or Gbps, to more than 400 Gbps, over distances of less than 10 meters to more than 2,000 kilometers, using a wide range of network protocols and physical configurations. 
We also provide products known as wavelength selective switches, or WSS. In long-haul and metro networks, each fiber may carry 50 to more than 100 different high-speed optical wavelengths. WSS are switches that are used to dynamically switch network traffic from one optical fiber to multiple other fibers without first converting to an electronic signal. The wavelength selective feature means that WSS enable any wavelength or combination of wavelengths to be switched from the input fiber to the output fibers. WSS products are sometimes combined with other components and sold as linecards that plug into a system chassis referred to as a reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers, or ROADM.
We have also entered the 3D Sensing market. 3D Sensing enables features such as facial recognition, gaming and virtual reality, as well as automotive market applications such as LiDAR and in-cabin recognition. VCSELs (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers) are core to 3D Sensing. We leverage our experience in laser technology in our 3D Sensing products.
Our line of optical components also includes packaged lasers and photodetectors for data communication and telecommunication applications.
Demand for our products is largely driven by the continually growing need for additional network bandwidth created by the ongoing proliferation of data and video traffic from video downloads, Internet protocol TV, social networking, on-line gaming, file sharing, enterprise IP/Internet traffic, cloud computing, and data center virtualization that must be handled by both wireline and wireless networks. Mobile traffic is increasing as the result of proliferation of smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. 
Our manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and we produce many of the key components used in making our products, including lasers, photodetectors and integrated circuits, or ICs, designed by our internal IC engineering teams. We also have internal assembly and test capabilities that make use of internally designed equipment for the automated testing of our optical subsystems and components. 
We sell our products primarily to manufacturers of storage systems, networking equipment and telecommunication equipment such as Broadcom, Ciena, Cisco Systems, Dell EMC, Ericsson, FiberHome, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei, IBM, Juniper, Nokia, QLogic (now a subsidiary of Marvell Technology), and ZTE, and to their contract manufacturers. These customers, in turn, sell their systems to businesses and to wireline and wireless telecommunication service providers and cable TV operators, collectively referred to as carriers. We also sell products to end-users.
We were incorporated in California in April 1987 and reincorporated in Delaware in November 1999. Our principal executive offices are located at 1389 Moffett Park Drive, Sunnyvale, California 94089, and our telephone number at that location is +1-408-548-1000.

Merger Agreement
On November 8, 2018, the Company, II-VI Incorporated, a Pennsylvania corporation ("Parent" or "II-VI") and Mutation Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Subsidiary"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
At the time the Merger becomes effective (the "Effective Time"), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("Company Stock") (other than shares of Company Stock owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, which will be cancelled without consideration, and holders of Company Stock, if any, who properly exercise their appraisal rights under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) outstanding immediately prior to the Merger will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive, for each share of Company Stock, at the stockholder’s election and subject to proration in the event the cash consideration or Parent Common Stock (as defined below) consideration is oversubscribed, either (i) $26.00 in cash (the "Cash Election Consideration"), (ii) 0.5546 of a share of common stock, no par value, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") (the "Stock Election Consideration"), or (iii) a combination of (A) 0.2218 of a share of Parent Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio") and (B) $15.60 in cash, without interest (the "Mixed Election Consideration"). On an average basis across all shares of Company Stock (including the Options (as defined below) and Performance RSUs (as defined below)), at the closing of the Merger, 60% of the aggregate amount of the outstanding shares of Company Stock (including the Options and Performance RSUs) will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Consideration, with the remaining 40% converted into the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Company Stock (whether vested or unvested) (an "Option") shall automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive an amount of Mixed Election Consideration equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Cash Election Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Option, payable no later than the Company’s next payroll date after the closing of the Merger. Further, as of the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units of the Company that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is subject to a performance-based vesting condition (a "Performance RSU") that relates solely to the value of Company Stock will vest as to a number of shares determined under the terms of the award and will be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Consideration, the Stock Election Consideration or the Mixed Election Consideration in accordance with the election made by the holder of such Performance RSU. At the Effective Time, each other award of restricted stock units of the Company that is outstanding and unvested will be assumed by Parent and continue to be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions (including vesting requirements) as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such assumed restricted stock unit awards will be equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Stock underlying such unvested restricted stock unit award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the sum of the (A) Exchange Ratio plus (B) the quotient obtained by dividing $15.60 by the Equity Award Measurement Price. The "Equity Award Measurement Price" means the volume weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ for the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time.
The Merger Agreement also provides, among other things, that the board of directors of Parent (the "Parent Board") will appoint, at the Effective Time, three members, each of whom are (i) members of the board of directors of the Company (the "Board") as of the date of the Merger Agreement, (ii) mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent, acting in good faith, and (iii) reasonably approved by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Parent Board.
The closing of the Merger is subject to, among other things, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock (the "Company Stockholder Approval"), which was obtained on March 26, 2019, and the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast for the proposal on the issuance of the Parent Common Stock and any restricted units of Parent issuable in connection with the Merger (the "Parent Stockholder Approval"), which was obtained on March 26, 2019. The closing of the Merger is also subject to various customary conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; receipt of other specified regulatory approvals; the absence of any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger; the SEC having declared effective a Form S-4 with respect to, and the approval of the listing on NASDAQ of, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger; the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (generally subject to a material adverse effect qualification); compliance with the covenants and agreements in the Merger Agreement in all material respects; and no 
 3

material adverse effect on either the Company or Parent. The closing of the Merger is also subject to Parent, the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Trustee"), entering into a supplemental indenture in connection with that certain (i) indenture, dated as of December 16, 2013 (the "2033 Notes Indenture"), by and among the Company and the Trustee governing the Company’s 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2033 (the "2033 Notes"), which was cancelled and discharged on May 1, 2019 in connection with the redemption of all of the remaining outstanding 2033 Notes, and (ii) indenture, dated as of December 21, 2016 (the "2036 Notes Indenture" and, together with the 2033 Notes Indentures, the "Indentures"), by and among the Company and the Trustee governing the Company’s 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2036 (the "2036 Notes" and, together with the 2033 Notes, the "Notes") providing, among other items, (a) at and after the Effective Time, pursuant, and subject to, the terms and conditions of the applicable Indenture, for the change in right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of the 2033 Notes and the 2036 Notes, as applicable, into the amount of shares of Parent Common Stock and cash, or the combination thereof, that a holder of a number of shares of Company Stock equal to the conversion rate of the 2033 Notes and the 2036 Notes immediately prior to the Effective Time would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Effective Time, and (b) Parent’s full and unconditional guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, of the 2033 Notes and the 2036 Notes. Though not a condition to Closing, Parent and Merger Subsidiary are also obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain debt financing that, together with the other financial resources of Parent, will be sufficient to satisfy all of Parent’s and Merger Subsidiary’s payment obligations under the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant, and subject, to the terms and conditions of the Indentures, each holder of Notes will have the right, at such holder’s option, to require the Company to repurchase any or all of such holder’s Notes, on the date specified by the Company that is not less than 20 business days and not more than 35 business days after the date of the Company’s notice to holders of the occurrence of the Merger, such notice to be delivered within 20 business days of the Effective Time, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date ("Merger Repurchase Date"). Further pursuant, and subject, to the terms and conditions of the Indentures, all or any portion of a holder’s Notes may be surrendered for conversion at any time from or after the date that is 25 scheduled trading days prior to the anticipated Effective Time (or, if later, the business day after the Company gives holders notice of the Merger) until the Merger Repurchase Date.
The Company has made customary representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement. The Company is also subject to customary covenants, including, among others, covenants (i) to conduct its business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, (ii) not to engage in specified types of transactions during this period unless agreed to in writing by Parent, (iii) to convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, which was held and such approval was obtained on March 26, 2019, and (iv) subject to certain exceptions, not to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the recommendation of the Board that the Company’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
Parent has made customary representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement. Parent is also subject to customary covenants, including, among others, (i) to conduct its business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, (ii) not to engage in specified types of transactions during this period unless agreed to in writing by the Company, (iii) to convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, which was held and such approval was obtained on March 26, 2019, and (iv) subject to certain exceptions, not to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to the Company the recommendation of the Parent Board that Parent’s shareholders vote in favor of the issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights, including the right of the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances to accept an unsolicited superior proposal from a third party. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company or Parent under specified circumstances (including termination by the Company to accept a superior proposal), a termination fee of $105,200,000 will be payable by the Company to Parent. The Company termination fee is also payable under certain other specified circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement. Further, the Company has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Parent Board fails to recommend that the shareholders of Parent vote in favor of the issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger or if the Parent withdraws, amends or modifies such recommendation. If the Company timely exercises its right to terminate the Merger Agreement after it obtains actual knowledge of such failure to recommend, or withdrawal, amendment or modification of such recommendation, a termination fee of $105,200,000 will be payable by Parent to the Company. The Merger Agreement also provides that each party to the Merger Agreement may compel the other party or parties thereto to specifically perform its or their obligations under the Merger Agreement.

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K on November 9, 2018 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Products
Our optical subsystems and components are integrated into our customers’ systems and used for fiber optics-based data communication and telecommunication networks.
Our family of optical subsystem products consists of transmitters, receivers, transceivers, transponders, and active optical cables principally based on the Ethernet, Fibre Channel, OTN and SONET/SDH protocols. A transmitter uses a laser plus direct or indirect modulation to convert electrical signals into optical signals for transmission over optical fiber. Receivers incorporating photo detectors convert incoming optical signals into electrical signals. A transceiver combines both transmitter and receiver functions in a single device. An active optical cable combines two transceivers and a fiber optic cable that are built into an integrated, connectorized cable assembly that is sold in various cable lengths. Our optical subsystem products perform these functions with high reliability and data integrity and support a wide range of protocols, transmission speeds, fiber types, wavelengths, transmission distances, physical configurations, and software enhancements.
Our high-speed optical subsystems are engineered to deliver value-added functionality and intelligence. Our optical subsystem products typically include a microprocessor with proprietary embedded software that provides customers real-time monitoring of transmitted and received optical power, temperature, drive current, and other link parameters for each port in their systems.
For data communication applications that rely on the Fibre Channel standard, we currently provide a wide range of optical subsystems for transmission applications at 1 to 28 Gbps. For data communication applications that rely on the Ethernet standard, we provide a broad range of optical subsystems for transmitting signals at 1 to 400 Gbps using the SFP, SFP+, XFP, X2, QSFP, QSFP28, QSFP56-DD, CXP, CFP, CFP2, CFP4, and proprietary form factors. For OTN and SONET/SDH-based telecommunication applications, we supply optical subsystems that are capable of transmitting at 0.155, 0.622, 2.5, 10, 40, 100, 200 and 400 Gbps.
We also offer a full line of optical subsystems for telecommunication applications using wavelength division multiplexing, or WDM technologies. Our products include coarse wavelength division multiplexing, or CWDM, transceivers in the SFP form factor and dense wavelength division multiplexing, or DWDM, transceivers in the SFP, SFP+, XFP, CFP2, CFP4, and proprietary form factors. These products include both fixed wavelength transceivers and tunable transceivers that are capable of dynamically tuning across a range of wavelengths in the C- and L-Bands.
As a result of several acquisitions, we have gained access to leading-edge technology for the manufacture of a number of active and passive optical components including vertical cavity surface emitting lasers, or VCSELs; Fabry-Perot, or FP, lasers; distributed feedback, or DFB, lasers; tunable lasers; positive intrinsic negative, or PIN, detectors; high-speed integrated waveguide detectors; Mach Zehnder Modulators; fused fiber couplers; isolators; filters; polarization beam combiners; and amplifiers. Most of these optical components are used internally in the manufacture of our optical subsystems. We currently sell some of these components in the so-called “merchant market” to other subsystems manufacturers. We are also producing laser and photodetector products for use in emerging consumer and auto applications.
We also offer products used in building access networks including optics for wireless infrastructure and fiber-to-the-home/curb networks and for parallel optics applications such as inter-chassis connections for switches, routers, and high-speed computing systems. 
We offer WSS and ROADM linecard products for wavelength management in DWDM telecommunication networks. These capabilities are made possible in part through the use of our liquid crystal on silicon, or LCoS, technology, similar to that used in miniature projectors. This technology provides a highly flexible WSS capable of operating on both 50 and 100 GHz International Telecommunications Union, or ITU, grids, based on our patented FlexgridTM technology. In addition, this LCoS-based architecture offers the capability for in-service upgrades of functionality and integration of additional system functionality, including route and select, drop and continue, channel monitoring, and channel contouring features. Our WSS and ROADM linecard product offering ranges from 1x2, 1x4 and 1x9 products up to higher output fiber port counts in our latest 1x23 and 2x1x20 products.

Customers
Our revenues are principally derived from sales of optical subsystems and components to a broad base of networking equipment manufacturers, data center operators, telecom service providers, consumer electronics, automotive companies, distributors, end customers, and system integrators. Sales of products for data communication applications represented 72%, 78%, and 72% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales of products for telecommunication applications represented 28%, 22%, and 28% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Sales to our ten largest customers represented 58%, 59%, and 56% of our total revenues during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Two customers, Cisco Systems and Huawei, represented more than 10% of our total revenues during fiscal 2019. Two customers, Cisco Systems and Google, represented more than 10% of our total revenues during fiscal 2018. Two customers, Cisco Systems and Huawei, represented more than 10% of our total revenues during fiscal 2017. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in any of these years.
Technology
The development of high quality optical subsystems and components for high-speed communications requires multidisciplinary expertise in the following technology areas:
High Frequency Integrated Circuit Design. Our optical subsystems development efforts are supported by an engineering team that specializes in analog/digital IC design. This group utilizes semiconductor technologies such as silicon complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor, or Si CMOS, and silicon germanium bipolar CMOS, or SiGe BiCMOS, to design high-speed, high performance proprietary ICs such as laser drivers, receiver pre-and post-amplifiers, and microprocessors. These proprietary ICs are incorporated across our transceiver and transponder product portfolio at data rates from 1 to 100 Gbps. We also design the advanced LCoS controller ICs for our WSS and ROADM linecard products. Our in-house IC design capabilities are critical to our ongoing development of future products.
Optical Subassembly and Mechanical Design. We established ourselves as a low-cost design leader beginning with our initial optical subsystems in 1992. From that base we have developed single-mode laser alignment approaches and low-cost, all-metal packaging techniques for improved electromagnetic interference, or EMI, performance and environmental tolerance. We develop our own component and packaging designs and integrate these designs with proprietary manufacturing processes that allow our products to be manufactured in high volume.
System Design. The design of all of our products requires a combination of sophisticated technical competencies, including optical engineering, high-speed electrical design, digital and analog application specific IC, or ASIC, design, and firmware and software engineering. We have built a substantial organization of engineers and scientists with skills in all of these areas. It is the integration and combination of these technical competencies that enables us to design and manufacture optical subsystem and component products that meet the needs of our customers.
Manufacturing System Design. Hardware, firmware, and software design skills are utilized to provide specialized manufacturing test systems for our internal use. These test systems are optimized for test capacity and broad test coverage. We use automated, software-controlled testing to enhance the field reliability of all Finisar products and to reduce the level of capital expenditures that would otherwise be required to purchase these test systems.
Optoelectronic Device Design and Wafer Fabrication. The ability to manufacture our own optical components provides significant cost savings as well as the ability to create unique, high performance components. This enhances our competitive position in terms of performance, time-to-market, and intellectual property. Most significantly, we design and manufacture a number of active components that are used in our optical subsystems. Certain of our past acquisitions provided us with wafer fabrication capability for designing and manufacturing VCSEL components, used in our shorter distance transceivers for data communication applications, PIN detectors and 1310 nm FP and DFB lasers used in our longer distance transceivers, although we continue to rely on third-party suppliers for a portion of our DFB laser requirements, and tunable lasers for use in our tunable XFP and SFP+ transceivers for telecommunication applications.
Competition
The market for optical subsystems and components for use in data communication and telecommunication applications remains highly competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors in these markets are:

• | product performance, features, functionality, and reliability;

 6


• | price/performance characteristics;


• | timeliness of new product introductions;


• | breadth of product line;


• | adoption of emerging industry standards;


• | service and support;


• | size and scope of distribution network;


• | brand name;


• | access to customers; and


• | size of installed customer base.

Competition in the market for optical subsystems and components varies by market segment. Our principal competitors for optical transceivers sold for data communication applications include Applied Optoelectronics, Foxconn, Innolight, Lumentum, and Sumitomo. Our principal competitors for optical transceivers sold for telecommunication applications include Acacia Communications, Fujitsu Optical Components, Lumentum, and Sumitomo. Our principal competitors for WSS ROADM products include CoAdna, Lumentum, Oplink, and Nistica. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors with respect to most of the foregoing factors based, in part, upon our broad product line, our sizeable installed base, our significant vertical integration, and our lower-cost manufacturing facilities in Ipoh, Malaysia and Wuxi, China.
Sales, Marketing and Technical Support
For sales of our optical subsystems and components, we utilize a direct sales force augmented by five world-wide distributors, eleven international distributors, two domestic distributors, 18 domestic manufacturers’ representatives, and eight international manufacturers’ representatives. Our direct sales force maintains close contact with our customers and provides technical support to our manufacturers’ representatives. In our international markets, our direct sales force works with local resellers who assist us in providing support and maintenance in the territories they cover.
Our marketing efforts are focused on increasing awareness of our product offerings for optical subsystems and our brand name. Key components of our marketing efforts include:

• | continuing our active participation in industry associations and standards committees to promote and further enhance Ethernet, Fibre Channel and SONET/SDH/OTN technologies, promote standardization in the data communication and telecommunication markets, and increase our visibility as industry experts; and


• | leveraging major trade show events and conferences to promote our broad product lines.

In addition, our marketing group focuses on product management and product strategy and also provides marketing support services for our direct sales force and our manufacturers’ representatives and resellers. Through our marketing activities, we provide technical and strategic sales support to our direct sales personnel and resellers, including in-depth product presentations, technical manuals, sales tools, pricing, marketing communications, marketing research, trademark administration, and other support functions.
A high level of continuing service and support is critical to our objective of developing long-term customer relationships. We emphasize customer service and technical support in order to provide our customers and their end users with the knowledge and resources necessary to successfully utilize our product line. Our customer service organization utilizes a technical team of field and factory applications engineers, technical marketing personnel and, when required, product design engineers. We provide extensive customer support throughout the qualification and sale process. In addition, we provide many resources through our World Wide Web site, including product documentation and technical information. We intend to continue to provide our customers with comprehensive product support and believe it is critical to remaining competitive.
Backlog
A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to customers through hub arrangements where revenue is generated as inventory that resides at these customers or their contract manufacturers is drawn down. Visibility as to future customer demand is limited in these situations. Most of our other revenues are derived from sales pursuant to individual purchase orders that remain subject to negotiation with respect to delivery schedules and are generally cancelable without significant penalties. Manufacturing capacity and availability of key components can also impact the timing and amount of revenue ultimately recognized under such sale arrangements. Accordingly, we do not believe that the backlog of undelivered product under these purchase orders at a particular time is a meaningful indicator of our future financial performance.

Manufacturing
We manufacture our optical subsystems at our production facility in Ipoh, Malaysia. This facility consists of 640,000 square feet, of which 240,000 square feet is suitable for clean room operations. We also conduct a portion of our new product introduction operations at our Ipoh facility. This facility is located on 840,000 square feet of land that we are leasing for 60 years, through June 28, 2055. In 2012, we entered into a 50-year lease for 550,000 square feet of land in Wuxi, China, where we built a 800,000 square foot facility. At this facility, we manufacture tunable and parallel transceivers, WSS components, ROADM line cards, passive optical components, coherent receivers, and high-end optical subassemblies used in VCSELs and detectors. In 2017, we entered into a 50-year lease for an additional 280,000 square feet of land adjacent to the above location in Wuxi, China, where we built an additional 300,000 square foot manufacturing facility. We manufacture WSS products at our 100,000 square foot facility in Sydney, Australia. We continue to conduct a substantial portion of our new product introduction activities at our Sunnyvale, California, Horsham, Pennsylvania, Sydney, Australia, and Shanghai, China facilities. In Sunnyvale, we also conduct supply chain management for certain components as well as quality assurance and documentation control operations. We maintain an international purchasing office in Shenzhen, China. We conduct wafer fabrication operations for the manufacture of VCSELs used in short wavelength transceiver products at our facility in Allen, Texas. In 2017, we purchased a 700,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Sherman, Texas, for wafer fabrication operations for the manufacture of VCSELs used in short wavelength transceiver products and 3D sensing products. We conduct wafer fabrication operations for the manufacture of long wavelength FP and DFB lasers at our facility in Fremont, California. We conduct wafer fabrication operations for the manufacture of tunable lasers and photonic integrated circuits, or PICs, at our facility in Jarfalla, Sweden. We manufacture high speed optical receivers and photodetectors at our facility in Berlin, Germany. We expect to continue to use contract manufacturers for a portion of our manufacturing needs, primarily printed circuit board assemblies. 
We design and develop a number of the key components of our products, including photodetectors, lasers, ASICs, printed circuit boards, and software. In addition, our manufacturing team works closely with our engineers to manage the supply chain. To assure the quality and reliability of our products, we conduct product testing and burn-in at our facilities in conjunction with inspection and the use of testing and statistical process controls. In addition, most of our optical subsystems have an intelligent interface that allows us to monitor product quality during the manufacturing process. Our facilities in Sunnyvale and Fremont, California; Allen, Texas; Horsham, Pennsylvania; Shanghai, China; Ipoh, Malaysia; Sydney, Australia; Jarfalla, Sweden; and Berlin, Germany are qualified under ISO 9001-9002.
Although we use standard parts and components for our products wherever possible, we currently purchase several key components from single or limited sources. Our principal single source components purchased from external suppliers include ASICs and certain DFB lasers that we do not manufacture internally. Generally, purchase commitments with our single or limited source suppliers are on a purchase order basis. We generally try to maintain a buffer inventory of key components. However, any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components, or the inability to procure these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time, would substantially harm our business. In addition, qualifying additional suppliers can be time-consuming and expensive and may increase the likelihood of errors.
We use a rolling 12-month forecast of anticipated product orders to determine our material requirements. Lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the demand for such components in relation to each supplier’s manufacturing capacity, internal manufacturing capacity, contract terms, and demand for a component at a given time.
Research and Development
In fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, our research and development expenses were $217.9 million, $239.0 million, and $217.9 million, respectively. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to continue to enhance the performance and reduce the cost of our existing products and to develop new products that maintain technological and business competitiveness. We focus our product development activities on addressing the evolving needs of our customers within the data communication and telecommunication markets. We also seek opportunities to leverage the technical and product competencies created for our core markets to develop products for other applications, especially products using active optical components that we design and manufacture. We work closely with our customers to monitor changes in the marketplace. We design our products around current industry standards and will continue to support emerging standards that are consistent with our product strategy. Our research and development groups are aligned with our various product lines, and we also have specific groups devoted to ASIC design and test, subsystem design, and software design. Our product development operations include the active involvement of our manufacturing engineers who examine each product for its manufacturability, predicted reliability, expected lifetime, and manufacturing costs.

We believe that our research and development efforts are key to our ability to maintain technical and business competitiveness and to deliver innovative products that address the needs of the market. However, there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will result in commercially successful products, or that our products will not be rendered obsolete by changing technology or new product announcements by other companies.
Intellectual Property
Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We currently own approximately 2,000 issued U.S. and foreign patents and have approximately 400 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We cannot assure that any patents will be issued as a result of pending patent applications or that our issued patents will be upheld. Any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter others from developing similar technology. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult. We have been involved in extensive litigation to enforce certain of our patents and are currently engaged in such litigation. Additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. This litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our business.
The optical networking and communications industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. We have been involved in extensive litigation to protect our products against accusations of infringement. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings." From time to time, other parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies in various jurisdictions that are important to our business, and such claims could result in additional litigation. Any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties, if determined adversely to us, could significantly harm our business. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, cause product shipment delays, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could significantly harm our business. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, our agreements with our customers typically require us to indemnify our customers from any expense or liability resulting from claimed infringement of third party intellectual property rights. In the event a claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement, our business would be significantly harmed.
Employees
As of April 28, 2019, we employed approximately 13,000 full-time employees and contractors, of whom approximately 1,300 were located in the United States and approximately 10,000 were located at our production facilities in Ipoh, Malaysia, and Wuxi, China. We also, from time to time, employ part-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. Certain of our employees in our Sydney, Australia facility are subject to a collective agreement not involving a union. In addition, we have a works council in our Berlin, Germany facility. We believe that there is a positive employee relations environment within our company.
