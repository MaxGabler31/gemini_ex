Business Overview
 
We are a development stage company located in Taipei City, Taiwan. We plan to market and distribute in Taiwan silica energy clothing manufactured by Shinin Silica Corp., a Taiwanese corporation (“Shinin”). Generally, that clothing consists of men’s and women’s undergarments and related apparel. That clothing is made from an energy silicon fiber and yarn made from a fine nanoscale silicon powder and polymer materials which, together, result in a reactive energy material. Additionally, that clothing is bio-degradable and quick-drying.
 
We believe that we will be successful in selling high quality silica energy clothing products at economical prices because we plan to buy the product directly from Shinin at discounted prices. We plan to enter into agreements with clothing product suppliers and retailers in Taiwan, such as specialty stores and department stores. By moving those silica energy clothing products directly from Shinin to the supplier and/or retailer, we are able to avoid the costs and fees associated with housing and storing those silica energy clothing products, which will result in more profit for us and better prices for our customers. The silica energy clothing products will be offered to suppliers and retailers at prices marked-up from 10% to 20% of our cost, which is the range of discounted prices at which we will purchase the silica energy clothing products from Shinin. Our customers will then sell the silica energy clothing products to consumers at retail prices, which are typically 20% to 30% higher than wholesale prices. Our customers will be asked to pay us 100% in advance.
 
We plan to fill placed orders and to supply the products within a period of forty days or less following receipt of any written order. We do not intend to offer any credit terms relating to order payments. Our customers will be asked to pay us 100% in advance. Customers will have two options to pay for products: by wire transfer or by sending a check/money order. If the customer decides to pay by check/money order, then we will apply a certain amount of days before shipping in order to have the check/money order cleared. Customers will be responsible to pay the shipping costs. As we anticipate having a 30-day period to process/fill orders, we do not plan to purchase silica energy products in advance, but, rather, on a per request basis. We do not intend to store inventory for any period of time. The orders will be shipped directly to the customers. Customers will be responsible for the custom duties, taxes, insurance or any other additional charges that may incur.

Marketing and Distribution Agreement
 
On July 1, 2015, we entered into a written Marketing and Distribution Agreement with Shinin pursuant to which we have a non-exclusive right to market and distribute in Taiwan silica energy clothing products manufactured by Shinin for a period of one year (the “Distribution Agreement”). Pursuant to the provisions of the Distribution Agreement, we will purchase the silica energy clothing products from Shinin at a price equal to 45% of the then current market prices for those products. Additionally, when we place an order with Shinin for silica energy clothing products, we are required to pay 50% of the purchase price for those products and pay the remaining balance of that purchase price before the products ordered are shipped from Shinin. 
Silica Energy Products
 
The silica energy clothing is manufactured using energy silicon yarn. Energy silicon yarn is a combination of silica, nylon, polyester, cotton and polypropylene. The inner part of the resulting fabric is comprised of polypropylene and the outer part of that fabric is silica and polyester. That fabric is 100% bio-degradable, quick-drying and will not adhere to skin.
 
That yarn is manufactured by combining silica nanometer powder and nylon powder to form silica nylon, which is then combined with nylon plastic to create the raw silica silk which is twisted into the yarn.
 
The silica energy clothing products that we intend to market and distribute are girdles, pants, corsets, underwear, t-shirts, shirts, coats, pants and skirts.
 
Additionally, certain advantages of those products are:
 


· | Ultra violet protection 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------
· | Improved blood circulation 
· | Resistant to electrostatic cling 
· | Non-flammable 
· | Quick-drying and transfer of moisture 
· | No loss of functionality after numerous washings 
· | Can be manufactured in any color 
· | Can be laundered without detergent or similar cleaning agent
· | Can be laundered by washing machines 
· | Won’t lose their function in the sunlight 

Competition
 
There are many barriers of entry in the clothing market, and the level of competition is extremely high. Examples of barriers of entry in this market include brand loyalty, aggressive lower pricing tactics, and economies of scale. Many of our established competitors have developed a brand following which would make our potential customers prefer their clothing products to Shinin’s. Aggressive lower pricing tactics implemented by our competitors would make it difficult for us to enter and compete in this market. Economies of scale make it easier for our larger established competitors to negotiate price discounts with their suppliers of clothing products, which would leave us at a disadvantage.
 
The principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and the quality of our products. We will be in a market where we will be in direct competition with many domestic and international companies offering competing products. Many large companies will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers. Many of these companies may have a greater and more established customer base than us. We will likely lose prospective business to such companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better prices for competing products than us, which may also cause us to lose prospective business. We also foresee challenges facing new market entrants. We may be unable to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We have not yet entered the market. Once we enter the market, we will be one of many participants in the business of distributing clothing products. Many established and well-financed entities are currently active in the business of distributing such products. Nearly all of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities than us. We are, consequently, at a competitive disadvantage in the market. Therefore, we may not be able to establish ourselves within the industry.
 
Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
We intend to distribute the silica energy clothing products in Taiwan. We intend to enter into agreements with numerous clothing product suppliers and retailers.
 
We plan to offer our product to larger department stores that have a high volume of customer traffic, as well as smaller boutique stores. Our competitive advantage is that we will offer unique, stylish, easy-to-use, high quality silica energy products, while maintaining reasonable prices.
 
Also, we intend to advertise our products on clothing product websites; internet search engines, such as Google, selling cost-per-click advertising; and offline media, including newspaper, outdoor advertising, radio, television and direct mail. We believe that some of our sales will be driven by web-based traffic, and our marketing plan has been designed with a strong focus on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba and leveraging social networking platforms.
 
We intend to integrate our marketing scheme with Facebook, so that buyers can compare their current clothing costs to those of their friends. Friends share information about their lifestyles, and we expect that this trend will continue as to reliable purchasing platforms. At checkout, consumers can elect to publish details about their online purchases on Facebook, describing their savings and the products purchased. Not only does this expand our market, but it also enables consumers to leverage their friends’ experiences of suitable clothing purchases.
 
12 Month Growth Strategy and Milestones
 
Our strategy is to maximize shareholder value by expanding operations and evaluating and cultivating new and alternative revenue generating opportunities. The Company is committed to marketing and distributing silicon energy clothing. While a strategic and wisely executed marketing campaign is key to expanding our operations; offering new, cutting-edge, innovative silica energy clothing products should position the Company in the best possible way for long term success.
Patents and Trademarks
 
At the present we do not have any patents or trademarks.
 
Need for any Government Approval of Products
 
We do not require any government approval for the marketing and distribution of that silicon energy clothing.
 
Research and Development Activities
 
Other than time spent researching our proposed business, we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date.
 
Environmental Laws
 
Our operations are not subject to any environmental laws.
