ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OUR COMPANY

NAMI Corp. (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) conducts its operations through its controlled, consolidated subsidiary SBS Mining Corp. Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (hereinafter referred to as “SBS”). SBS, founded on August 14, 2008, is a Malaysian corporation primarily engaged in trading activities for certain mineral ores and mining and exploration of properties located in Malaysia.
OUR CORPORATE HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 2012, and November 30 was established as the Company’s fiscal year-end. On July 4, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) approved changing the fiscal year-end of the Company from November 30 to June 30 as a result of the SBS Acquisition (as defined below). The Company was initially created to engage in developing a built-in safe with a combination lock that could store personal and/or valuable items inside of backpacks, carry-on luggage and suitcases. Since its inception and until the acquisition of SBS, the Company was a development stage company without significant assets or any revenue.

On October 31, 2016, a change in control of the Company occurred by virtue of the Company’s largest shareholder selling 60,750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Company’s current Chairman, Ong Tee Keat, an individual residing in Malaysia, which represented 60.22% of the Company’s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock at that time. Such 60,750,000 shares sold represented all of the shares of the Company’s common stock owned by such prior shareholder.

On October 31, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the “Nevada SOS”) whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by (a) increasing the Company’s authorized number of shares of common stock from 200 million to 5 billion; and (b) increasing all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of seven (7) shares for every one (1) share held. The Company’s Board of Directors approved this amendment on October 26, 2016.

On November 3, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada SOS whereby it entered into a statutory merger with its wholly owned subsidiary, NAMI Corp., pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200 et. seq. The effect of such merger is that the Company was the surviving entity and changed its name to “NAMI Corp.”

Acquisition of SBS

On July 12, 2018, we completed a reverse acquisition transaction through a share exchange with GMCI Corp (“GMCI”), the sole shareholder of SBS, whereby we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of SBS from GMCI in exchange for issuance of a total of 720,802,346 shares of our common stock to GMCI, representing 102.08% of our pre-merger issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “SBS Acquisition” or “Share Exchange”). As a result of the reverse acquisition, SBS became our wholly owned subsidiary; and the former SBS Shareholder, GMCI, became our controlling stockholder. The share exchange transaction was treated as a recapitalization, with SBS as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party for accounting purposes. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of SBS. 

Immediately prior to the Share Exchange, GMCI owned all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SBS. As a result of our acquisition of SBS, we now own all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SBS. Subsequent to the closing of the Share Exchange, we conduct our operations through our controlled, consolidated subsidiary SBS. SBS is primarily engaged in mining and exploration of properties located in Malaysia.

On July 4, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved changing the fiscal year-end of the Company from November 30 to June 30 as a result of the SBS Acquisition.

On July 19, 2018, the Company was notified that the Board of GMCI deemed it to be in the best interests of GMCI and its stockholders for GMCI to approve and declare a dividend of restrictive shares of NAMI Corp. to the stockholders of GMCI, on a pro rata basis, determined in accordance with the number of shares of capital stock of GMCI held by such stockholders, thereby transferring ownership of 100% of the outstanding restrictive shares of NAMI Corp. owned by GMCI to the stockholders of GMCI (collectively, the “Nami Stock Dividend”). The Nami Stock Dividend was completed on August 21, 2018.

Filing of S-1 Registration Statement for our Selling Shareholders

On November 13, 2018, the Company filed a S-1 Registration Statement to register sale of up to 322,388,472 shares of our common stock by persons who received shares of our common stock in our Nami Stock Dividend distribution in August 2018 and by persons who purchased shares of our common stock in private placements that we effected from April to September 2017. The recipients of stock dividends and purchasers of common stock in such private placements whose shares are being registered for resale are referred to in this prospectus as the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders may sell common stock from time to time in the principal market on which the stock will be traded at the prevailing market price or in negotiated transactions. With respect to shares of our common stock that may be offered and sold from time to time by the selling stockholders, we will receive no proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to this offering. The Stock Exchange Commission (“SEC”) declared the effectiveness of the resale S-1 Registration Statement on November 26, 2018. 
OVERVIEW

SBS, founded in August 14, 2008, is a Malaysian corporation primarily engaged in bauxite financing and trading, as well as mining and exploration of properties located in Malaysia.
SBS is located at No 1, 1st Floor, Lorong Sekilau 1, Bukit Sekilau, 25200 Kuantan, Pahang Darul Makmur, Malaysia.

On March 26, 2015, GMCI entered into a share exchange agreement (the “GMCI Agreement”) with all of the original shareholders of SBS (the “SBS Original Shareholders”). Pursuant to the GMCI Agreement, GMCI acquired 600,000 shares of capital stock of SBS (the “Original SBS Shares”) from the SBS Original Shareholders. and in exchange issued 500,000,000 restricted shares of its common stock to the SBS Original Shareholders.

The 600,000 Original SBS Shares constituted all of the issued and outstanding shares of SBS and were held by a total of three (3) shareholders, including GMCI’s sole director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lok Khing Ming. Mr. Lok owned ten percent (10%) of the Original SBS Shares, or 60,000 shares. The remaining shares were owned by Mr. Liew Chin Loong (90,000 shares, or 15% of the Original SBS Shares), who resides in Malaysia and LYF & Son Realty Sdn. Bhd. (450,000 shares, or 75% of the Original SBS Shares), a Malaysian corporation. Pursuant to the GMCI Agreement, Mr. Lok received 50 million shares of GMCI’s common stock; Mr. Liew received 75 million shares; and LYF & Son Realty Sdn. Bhd. received 375 million shares. As a result of the GMCI Agreement, SBS became a wholly owned subsidiary of GMCI; and GMCI carried on the business of SBS as its primary business. The closing of the GMCI Agreement occurred on April 23, 2015.

In August 2018, SBS designated a new class of preferred equity, designated the 12% redeemable cumulative preference shares, in its attempt to raise capital for business expansion and exploration of mining activities. SBS authorized the issuance of up to 50 million shares at an issue price of RM 1.0 per share. This new preferred equity carries a cumulative 12% preferred dividend, payable on a quarterly basis, based on the issue price of the preferred security (the “Preferred Dividend”). The Preferred Dividend will have priority over any payment of dividends on the common equity of SBS. The preferred shares automatically convert to NAMI Corp. common shares two years after issuance if not converted earlier at the rate of USD 1.50 on then value translated into USD of each 12% redeemable cumulative preference share. In the event of the liquidation or winding up of SBS, the preferred shares are entitled to distributions prior to any amounts distributed to the common equity holders. The holders of the preferred shares, so long as the cumulative Preferred Dividend is timely paid each quarter, have no general voting rights, but have rights to vote on any matters that affect the provisions of the preference shares with the number of preferred shares held so long as the Preferred Dividend remains unpaid. In August 2018, SBS commenced an equity raise of up to RM 50,000,000 (approximately USD 12.4 million) through the issuance of redeemable preference shares subject to a cumulative dividend of 12%, and as of the date of this report, we have raised RM 280,000 (USD $68,408). The preferred share subscription offering was closed on February 28, 2019.

Products and Suppliers 

Bauxite Financing 

Until 2016, SBS was focused on exploration activities in order to develop properties for producing metal ores, such as iron ore, bauxite and tin ore. SBS held licenses to two (2) properties located in Malaysia and on which it was prospecting for iron ore mining. The total mining area included as part of those two (2) licenses consisted of 100 hectares (247 acres). At the time that the GMCI Agreement was concluded, the market price per delivered dry tonne for iron ore was between $45 and $65. SBS believed that there would be a downward trend for iron ore prices and eventually the market price fell below $45 in December 2015. Accordingly, SBS commenced a plan to move into financing bauxite mining and trading in China. In January 2016, SBS’s two (2) licenses expired; and as a result of the lack of economic viability in the marketing of iron ore, management determined not to renew these licenses upon expiration.

SBS provides financing for the acquisition, stockpiling storage, exporting and shipment of bauxite ore from Malaysia. Currently, SBS has provided funding to Sincere Pacific Mining (M) Sdn. Bhd. (“Sincere Pacific”) to purchase and sell and export bauxite through a verbal agreement. Sincere Pacific is considered a related party as Mr. Liew Chin Loong, a director and officer of SBS, is also a fifty percent (50%) owner and a director of Sincere Pacific.

SBS and Sincere Pacific have verbally agreed to work in partnership to acquire and arrange transport for stockpiled bauxite shipments to Mainland China. Services required for the loading, processing and transport of bauxite from mine sites to the port will be provided by SBS and Sincere Pacific directly. Sincere Pacific has agreed to manage all labor, processing, transport and export of the ore until such time as the parties have concluded a total of seven (7) shipments.

Sincere Pacific holds a special permit from the government of Malaysia that allows it to hold up to 1.8 million metric tonnes (all tonnes referred to herein are metric) of bauxite stockpile for shipment at Felda Bukit Goh, Kuantan. This permit has no expiration date. Sincere Pacific and SBS intend to conclude approximately seven (7) shipments under this permit. As of June 30, 2018, the two parties have concluded five shipments. The remaining two shipments to be have not yet been concluded and do not have a set date for shipping. On March 22, 2018, Sincere Pacific obtained an additional bauxite export license for a total tonnage of 124,160.67 metric tonnes. The permit expired on April 30, 2018. No sales were made by Sincere Pacific under the agreement in the year ended June 30, 2019. Sincere Pacific acquires or purchases bauxite from multiple sources in Malaysia for selling the ore to customers in China.

Upon purchasing bauxite in Malaysia, Sincere Pacific processes the ore in its facilities, then stockpiles the ore pending shipment. Each shipment of bauxite consists of up to 55,000 metric tonnes. SBS does not take physical possession of the minerals at any time. It has been agreed between the parties that SBS shall receive a commission based on the gross amount of washed bauxite tonnage of up to 20,000 metric tonnes per shipment. Thereafter, if successful, the two parties will enter a formal agreement with respect to further shipments under newly negotiated terms. It is anticipated by our management team that the sales price obtained by Sincere Pacific for unwashed bauxite could gross a total of up to USD 24.50 to USD 26.00 per dry and delivered metric tonne, free on board stowed and trimmed, subject to certain penalties or bonus based on the percentage of certain mineral compounds present (primarily aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide). Sincere Pacific issues payment to SBS upon successful conclusion of shipments, at an agreed USD 1.00 per delivered dry tonne, net any applicable fees such as storage, etc. The parties intend to formalize a written agreement for future mineral trading activities following successful conclusion of approximately seven (7) shipments whereby we hope that SBS will receive commissions on up to 140,000 gross tonnes. As of the date of this report, no formalized written agreement has been completed.

However, the price at which Sincere Pacific sells a shipment of bauxite is subject to negotiation and current market prices. Therefore, this average net income of USD 1.00 per tonne payable to SBS is subject to adjustment and possible volatility.

To date, Sincere Pacific has completed five (5) shipments of bauxite and SBS has provided Sincere Pacific with $614,226 (RM$2,504,769) of financing used towards a portion of these shipments. Of the total financing advanced by SBS, $186,744 (RM$800,000) has been repaid by Sincere Pacific as of the date of this filing. Through June 30, 2018, SBS has received revenue of $84,271 (RM$350,306) in commissions from Sincere Pacific from its bauxite trading operations. No sales were made by Sincere Pacific under the agreement in the year ended June 30, 2019 and therefore no commissions were received by the Company during the year ended June 30, 2019.

Sea Sand Mining 

On August 30, 2017, SBS entered into a partnership agreement with JHW to establish a venture for sea sand mining and dredging on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The concession was first granted with an area of 1,113km², which was later amended and reduced to 383km². The final approved area was 20.48km² within the jurisdiction of the state of Terengganu, Malaysia (the “Area”). Pursuant to the agreement, JHW was responsible for carrying out and submitting to the relevant authorities all necessary study reports, including, but not limited to, Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) reports and feasibility and hydraulic studies with respect to the Area to obtain approval for the sea sand mining and dredging license (the “Final Approval”). SBS was responsible for bearing all costs and expenses incurred with respect to such applications. SBS has the exclusive rights to operate mining and extraction in the Area and is responsible for planning the operation, supervision, coordination, management and implementation of the mining operations of the Area. SBS agrees that gross profit from operations of the mining activities in the Area shall be allocated 25% to JHW and 75% to SBS pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement. 

The Company and JHW has fulfilled all regulatory requirements and obtained necessary approvals from all governmental agencies, including Department of Environment (“DOE”) (Jabatan Alam Sekitar), Department of Mineral and Geoscience Malaysia (“JMG”) (Jabatan Mineral dan Geosains Malaysia) and all 13 agencies under the jurisdiction of the state and federal governments of Malaysia.

The Company and JWH is committed to comply with all regulatory requirements and as such, submitted the EIA report on July 2018 and was duly approved by the DOE on September 2, 2018. In addition to preparing the EIA report, the Group also obtained approval from JMG on September 14, 2018, and finally, the sea sand mining and dredging license was approved by KATS on January 10, 2019. The Group is now in a position to begin its sea sand mining operation. The license expires on January 9, 2022.

The general location of the sea sand mining area is provided in the map below. 


Entry into Letter of Intent of Granite Mining Business

On January 17, 2019, NAMI Corp. entered into a Letter of Intent with Pembinaan Kaya Hebat Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian corporation engaged in granite mining business (“PKH”), for the acquisition by NAMI Corp. of up to one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding capital stock of PKH with consideration at a purchase price at fair market value (the “PKH Acquisition”). The completion of the PKH Acquisition is subject to various conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, negotiating and executing a form of purchase agreement that is acceptable to both parties, approval of the financial statements of both parties, and fair market valuation of PKH. In the event that NAMI Corp. is able to complete the PKH Acquisition, it intends to operate PKH as its wholly owned subsidiary or a majority-owned subsidiary.

NAMI Corp. aspires to become a global diversified mining company and is actively engaged in plans to expand by communicating with prospective mining businesses. NAMI Corp. is currently beginning to explore opportunities that may allow them to obtain certain granite mining concessions located in the state of Perak, Malaysia.

River Sand Mining

On September 6, 2019, SBS Mining Corp. Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (“SBS”), a wholly owned subsidiary of NAMI Corp. (the “Group”), entered into a mining agreement with Wan Ismail bin Wan Ahmad (the “Donor”) pursuant to which the Donor granted to SBS the sole and exclusive rights to mine for river sand and other materials from a 1.9040 hectare (4.7 acre) plot of land located at Kampung Tiram, district of Kuala Kuantan, Kuantan, Malaysia (the “Concession”) for which the Donor had received a lease license from the State Government of Pahang. SBS shall pay the Donor a fixed monthly rate for the sole and exclusive rights to mine the Concession.

With the grant of the sole and exclusive rights of the aforementioned mining right for river sand, the Company expands its current business portfolio to river sand mining and trading. Meanwhile, the Company plans to continue acquiring strategic mining concessions to enhance its river sand mining division.

OUR INDUSTRY

Bauxite Trading 

The shipments and demand for bauxite from Malaysia has increased, as illustrated by the fact that the People’s Republic of China (“China”) imported 14 times more bauxite from Malaysia in November 2014 than in March 2014,1 after an export ban in Indonesia stopped supplies of the ore to China, which is the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals. As at the date of this report, the ban imposed on Indonesia has been lifted, which could lessen China’s increased purchase of bauxite from Malaysia. Despite the lifting of the ban, bauxite mines are springing up in Malaysia and shipping an increasing amount to China, helping fill the gap left when Indonesia banned ore exports in January 2015.

In 2014, Malaysia exported 3.2 million tonnes of bauxite globally, compared to 154,044 metric tonnes in 2013. In 2015, Malaysia exported 24.3 million tonnes, resulting in $1.1 billion of revenue to exporters. China accounts for 99% of Malaysia’s export of bauxite. In 2016, the government of Malaysia halted all mining activities and ordered the clearing of the country’s huge stockpiled inventory of bauxite, requiring all exports to be done pursuant to approved permits issued by the Malaysian government (“Approved Permits”).2 As a result, Malaysia exported just 7.4 million metric tonnes of bauxite in 2016. The ban on the mining of bauxite was lifted in April 2019. The total approximate amount of exported bauxite in 2018 decreased significantly to 515,217 tonnes as compared to 822,668 tonnes of bauxite exported in 2017.

Sea Sand Mining 

The process of sea sand mining is extracting sand from the ocean bed with heavy machinery. Then sands are dredged and stored into bunkers or vessels that will be shipped to a buyer’s destination. In commercial businesses, sands are mainly used as construction materials (e.g., brick, concrete, and roads) and for land reclamation (also known as landfills). In addition, a full EIA must be carried out to ensure the mining is done responsibly, keeping it in balance with the wildlife and ecosystem within its vicinity.

The demand for sea sand has soared globally, mostly for industrial and land reclamation purposes. According to the United Nation Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN COMTRADE), international trades value has increased six-fold in the last 25 years. (source link: http://comtrade.un.org). The Department of Mineral & Geoscience Malaysia reported that out of 36.7 million tonnes of sea sand produced in Malaysia in 2017, 1.5 million tonnes were exported, almost exclusively to Singapore.

River Sand Mining

River sand can originate from a wide variety of sources such as from decomposed igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks; deposits of glacial sands or deposits of ancient sea sands in the form of uplifted or stranded beaches. Sands from rivers are a preferred source.

Apart from Perlis and Melaka, all other states contributed to the production of river sand in 2017. Local demand is expected to come from the revival of mega projects that were halted previously such as the Bandar Malaysia, East Coast Rail Link and Light Rail Transit 3 (“LRT 3”) projects. Bandar Malaysia’s development which occupies the former airport in Sungai Besi is estimated to be 196 hectare in size and will include 10,000 affordable housing units, a people’s park and the priority for the use of local content and materials. Completion date is not confirmed yet but development is expected to take 20 years to complete. Tech giants such as Alibaba and Huawei have also expressed their interest to set up their ICT centres in Bandar Malaysia. 

The East Coast Rail Link was given the go-ahead again in April 2019 after renegotiations with the rail link’s length reduced by 40 kilometres to 648 kilometres and the cost of building each kilometre drop to RM68 million from RM98 million. The project is expected to complete in December 2026. Construction work on the LRT3 project is also expected to resume in the second half of 2019 after renegotiations. The 36 kilometre project connects Bandar Utama to Johan Setia in Klang with the completion date for the project set for 28 February 2024. 

Demand for river sand from Malaysia can also come from other countries especially China and India. Several large infrastructure projects are taking place in China such as the Shanghai Urban Rail Transit Expansion to build 6 subway lines and 3 intercity railways totalling 286 kilometres, the Intercity Railway along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu province and the Wuhan Urban Rail Transit projects. The Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor Project (“DMIC”) is a planned industrial development project between Delhi and Mumbai with an estimated investment of USD90 billion. The investments will be spread across 6 states through the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor that will be 1,483 kilometres long which will serve as the industrial corridor's transportation backbone. The DMIC will have 24 industrial regions, 8 smart cities, 2 international airports, 5 power projects, 2 mass rapid transit systems and 2 logistical hubs. Implementation will be done in three phases with phase 1 to be completed in 2025 and the final phase scheduled to complete in 2037.

COMPETITION

Currently, we do not have any direct competition with respect to the specific properties to which we hold licenses. Sincere Pacific is one of the few holders of Approved Permits in Malaysia to export bauxite. It has little competition in terms of purchasing and exporting bauxite.

In terms of developing our business plan and conducting exploration and later deposit development, we expect to compete for qualified geological and environmental experts to assist us in our exploration of mining prospects, as well as any other consultants, employees and equipment that we may require in order to conduct our operations.

Currently, there is significant competition for financial capital to be deployed in mining and material extraction. Therefore, it is difficult for smaller companies such as us to attract investment for its exploration activities. We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to compete for capital funds; and without adequate financial resources management, we cannot assure that the Company will be able to compete in exploration activities and ultimately in material deposit development, production and sales.

MARKETS, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

If we are able to obtain the Final Approval from relevant government authorities and decide to proceed with our sea sand mining business, we plan to distribute and sell sand to customers from Malaysia’s neighboring countries, such as China, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Brunei and Cambodia. Overall, market demand for sand is high. Singapore remains the largest importer of sand for land reclamation purposes, filling the sea along its coast with imported sand. Since 1960, Singapore has expanded its physical size by 24%.3 The Department of Mineral & Geoscience Malaysia reported that out of 36.7 million tonnes of sea sand produced in Malaysia in 2017, 1.5 million tonnes were exported, almost exclusively to Singapore.

In Vietnam, scientists from the Vietnam Institute of Transport Science & Technology (“ITST”) warn that the domestic supply of natural sand is nearing an end and could be depleted by 2022 due to excessive exploitation.4 Furthermore, illegal mining activities in Vietnam have reached epidemic proportions, as reported in 2017 by Vietnam’s Deputy Minister of Public Security, Senior Lieutenant General Lê Quý Vương, noting that police had detected more than 4,300 violations in more than 8,000 inspections in the past year.5

In Indonesia, residents are resisting sand mining and the construction of artificial islands because of the potential harm to fish stocks and the environment. Reports describe how locals are mounting fierce resistance against sand mining off the southern tip of Indonesia’s Sulawesi Island and land reclamation in Makassar, which has caused the provincial government to suspend all ongoing activities.6

Cambodia has outlawed sand exports from a coastal region where it has been primarily funneled in huge quantities to Singapore. However, it appears that previous bans had failed to stem the export.7 Furthermore, internal reports from the United Nations questioned Cambodia’s sand exports where UN data showed that Cambodia had exported $752 million worth of sand to Singapore. In spite of such reports of wide-scale exports, Cambodia only reported $5 million worth of trade value exported to Singapore. 8 This large-scale dredging would certainly have an adverse impact on the natural environment and the local communities. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

SBS has no significant intellectual property as of the date of this filing.

REGULATION

Because our operating subsidiary SBS is located in Malaysia, our business is regulated by the national and local laws of Malaysia. We believe our conduct of business complies with existing Malaysia laws, rules and regulations.

Bauxite exports require Approved Permits issued by the Ministry of Malaysia. Sincere Pacific was issued an Approved Permit that can be renewed with the Malaysian government.

The exploration and development of a mining prospect in Malaysia is subject to regulation by a number of governmental authorities. The regulations address many environmental issues relating to air, soil and water contamination and apply to many mining-related activities, including exploration, mine construction, mineral and ore extraction, ore milling, water use, waste disposal and use of toxic substances. 


· | The Mineral Development Act of 1994 (“MDA”) defines the powers of the Federal Government on matters pertaining to the inspection and regulation of mineral exploration, mining and other related issues. The legislation is enforced by the Department of Minerals and Geosciences of Malaysia.

· | The Continental Shelf Act of 1966 (“CSA”) relates to the continental shelf of Malaysia, the exploration thereof and the exploitation of its natural resources. The CSA regulates applications for licenses that permit mining activities on the continental shelf. 
· | The Customs Act 1967 regulates the import and export of goods, with the clearance of import, export and transit of goods coming under the purview of Royal Malaysian Customs Department (“RMCD”). Some products require a license or Approved Permit (“AP”) before importing or exporting. Sand is among the products that need a license or AP to export. As APs are issued by Permit Issuing Agencies (“PIAs”), which are the relevant ministries relating to the products being exported or imported, the AP for sand export is issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.


In addition, we are subject to regulations relating to labor standards, occupational health and safety, mine safety, general land use, export of minerals and taxation. Many of the regulations require permits or licenses to be obtained and the filing of certain notices, the absence of which, or the inability to obtain, will adversely affect the ability for us to conduct our exploration, development and operation activities. The failure to comply with the regulations and terms of permits and licenses may result in fines or other penalties or in revocation of a permit or license or loss of a prospect.

INSURANCE

Insurance companies in Malaysia offer limited business insurance products. While business interruption insurance is available to a limited extent in Malaysia, we have determined that the risks of interruption, the cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. As a result, we are subject to risk inherent to our business, including equipment failure, theft, natural disasters, industrial accidents, labor disturbances, business interruptions, property damage, product liability, personal injury and death. Furthermore, if we suffer losses, damages or liabilities, including those caused by natural disasters or other events beyond our control and we are unable to make a claim against a third party, we will be required to bear all such losses from our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
