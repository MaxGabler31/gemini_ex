• | ski school,


• | dining, and


• | retail/rental operations.

On August 15, 2018, we closed on our acquisition of Stevens Pass Resort in the State of Washington, and on September 27, 2018, we closed on our acquisition of Triple Peaks, LLC (“Triple Peaks”), the parent company of Okemo Mountain Resort in Vermont, Crested Butte Mountain Resort in Colorado, and Mount Sunapee Resort in New Hampshire. The operations of these four resorts will be reported in our Mountain segment. These four resorts are discussed in additional detail below as well as in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Our Lodging segment includes the following:

• | owned and/or managed luxury hotels under our RockResorts brand, as well as other strategic lodging properties,

Our resorts in Colorado, Utah, Lake Tahoe, Vermont, New Hampshire, Washington State and British Columbia, Canada are year-round mountain resorts that provide a comprehensive resort experience to a diverse clientele with an attractive demographic profile. Our resorts offer a broad complement of winter and summer recreational activities, including skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, snowtubing, sightseeing, mountain biking, guided hiking, zip lines, challenge ropes courses, alpine slides, mountain coasters, children’s activities and other recreational activities.
Our Mountain segment derives revenue through the sale of lift tickets, including season passes, as well as a comprehensive offering of amenities available to guests, including ski and snowboard lessons, equipment rentals and retail merchandise sales, a variety of dining venues, private club operations and other winter and summer recreational activities. In addition to providing extensive guest amenities, we also lease some of our owned and leased commercial space to third party operators to add unique restaurants and retail stores to the mix of amenities at the base of our resorts.
Ski Industry/Competition
There are approximately 770 ski areas in North America and approximately 470 in the U.S., ranging from small ski area operations that service day skiers to large resorts that attract both day skiers and destination resort guests looking for a comprehensive vacation experience. We have a large presence in the Rocky Mountain region and the Lake Tahoe region, and also operate resorts in the Pacific Northwest and Northeast. During the 2017/2018 North American ski season, combined skier visits for all ski areas in North America were approximately 72.7 million. Our North American mountain resorts and urban ski areas, owned as of July 31, 2018, had approximately 11.5 million skier visits during the 2017/2018 ski season representing approximately 15.8% of North American skier visits.
Our Rocky Mountain region mountain resorts appeal to both day skiers and destination guests due to our Colorado resorts’ proximity to Colorado’s Front Range (Denver, Colorado Springs and Boulder) metropolitan areas and Park City’s proximity to the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. The Colorado Front Range has a population of approximately 4.8 million and is within approximately 100 miles from each of our Colorado resorts along the I-70 corridor, a major interstate highway. Additionally, the Salt Lake City metropolitan area has a population of approximately 1.2 million and is approximately 30 miles from Park City. These resorts are also accessible from several airports, including Denver International Airport and Eagle County Airport in Colorado and the Salt Lake City International Airport in Utah and have a wide range of amenities available at each resort, as well as within the proximate base areas, villages and towns. 
Lake Tahoe, which straddles the border of California and Nevada, is a major skiing destination less than 100 miles from Sacramento and Reno and approximately 200 miles from San Francisco, drawing skiers from the entirety of California and Nevada and making it a convenient destination for both day skiers and destination guests. 
There is limited opportunity for development of new destination ski resorts due to the limited private lands on which ski areas can be built, the difficulty in obtaining the appropriate governmental approvals to build on public lands and the significant capital needed to construct the necessary infrastructure. As such, there have been virtually no new destination ski resorts in North America for over 35 years, which has and should continue to allow the best-positioned destination resorts to benefit from future industry growth. Our resorts compete with other major destination mountain resorts, including, among others, Aspen Snowmass, Copper Mountain, Mammoth, Deer Valley, Snowbird, Squaw Valley USA, Killington, Sierra at Tahoe, Steamboat, Jackson Hole and Winter Park, as well as other ski areas in Colorado, California, Nevada, Utah, the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, Southwest and British Columbia, Canada, and other destination ski areas in North America and worldwide as well as non-ski related vacation options and destinations. Additionally, our season pass products compete with other multi-resort frequency and pass products in North America, including the IKON Pass, the Mountain Collective Pass and various regional and local pass products.
The ski industry statistics stated in this section have been derived from data published by Colorado Ski Country USA, Canadian Ski Council, Kottke National End of Season Survey 2017/2018 (the “Kottke Survey”) and other industry publications.
Our Competitive Strengths
Our premier resorts and business model differentiate our Company from the rest of the ski industry. We have iconic, branded mountain resorts in important ski destinations in Colorado, Utah, Lake Tahoe, the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest, including British Columbia, Canada. Through our sales of season passes, we provide our guests with a strong value proposition in return 
7

for guests committing to ski at our resorts prior to, or very early into the ski season, which we believe attracts more guests to our resorts. We believe we invest in more capital improvements than our competitors and we create synergies by operating multiple resorts, which enhances our profitability by enabling customers to access our network of resorts with our season pass products. Most of our mountain resorts located in the U.S. typically rank in the most visited ski resorts in the U.S. (six of the top ten for the 2017/2018 U.S. ski season), and most of our mountain resorts consistently rank in the top ranked ski resorts in North America according to industry surveys, which we attribute to our mountain resorts’ ability to provide a high-quality experience. 
We believe the following factors contribute directly to each resort’s success:
Exceptional Mountain Experience

• | World-Class Mountain Resorts and Integrated Base Resort Areas

Our mountain resorts offer a multitude of skiing and snowboarding experiences for the beginner, intermediate, advanced and expert levels. Each mountain resort is fully integrated into expansive resort base areas offering a broad array of lodging, dining, retail, nightlife and other amenities, some of which we own or manage, to our guests.

• | Snow Conditions

Our resorts in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and Utah, the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Lake Tahoe and the Coast Mountains in British Columbia, Canada receive average annual snowfall between 20 and 39 feet. Average annual snowfall in Australia is significantly lower than at North American ski resorts. However, Perisher generally receives higher average annual snowfall compared to other Australian alpine ski resorts, which is due to its location in the Australian Alps and the elevation of its terrain. Even in these areas which receive abundant snowfall, we have invested in significant snowmaking systems that help provide a more consistent experience, especially in the early season. Additionally, we provide several hundred acres of groomed terrain at each of our mountain resorts with extensive fleets of snow grooming equipment.

• | Lift Service

We systematically upgrade our lifts and put in new lifts to increase uphill capacity and streamline skier traffic to maximize the guest experience. In the past several years, we have installed several high speed chairlifts and gondolas across our mountain resorts, including new high speed, six-passenger chairlift replacements for each of the Northwoods lift at Vail Mountain, the Peak 10 Falcon SuperChair at Breckenridge and the Montezuma lift at Keystone; a new high speed, four person chair replacement for the Drink of Water chair at Beaver Creek; a high speed quad replacement for the Sun Up chairlift at Vail Mountain; several chairlifts at Wilmot and an eight-passenger gondola connecting Park City and Canyons. For the 2018/2019 ski season, upgrades to various chairlifts include, among other projects, a new 10-person gondola running from the base to the top of Blackcomb Mountain, replacing the Wizard and Solar four person chairs with a single state-of-the-art gondola; upgrading the four-person Emerald express chairlift to a high speed six-person chairlift on Whistler Mountain; upgrading the three-person fixed grip Catskinner chairlift to a four-person high speed lift at Blackcomb Mountain; upgrading the fixed grip High Meadow chair to a four person high speed lift at the Canyons area of Park City; replacing the Galaxy two-person chairlift with a three-person chairlift at Heavenly and upgrading the Leichhardt T-bar to a four-person chairlift at Perisher.

• | Terrain Parks

Our mountain resorts and urban ski areas are committed to leading the industry in terrain park design, education and events for the growing segment of freestyle skiers and snowboarders. Each of our mountain resorts has multiple terrain parks that include progressively-challenging features. These park structures, coupled with freestyle ski school programs, promote systematic learning from basic to professional skills.
Extraordinary Service and Amenities

• | Commitment to the Guest Experience

Our focus is to provide quality service at every level of the guest experience. Prior to arrival at our mountain resorts, guests can receive personal assistance through our full-service, in-house travel center and through our comprehensive websites to book desired lodging accommodations, lift tickets, ski school lessons, equipment rentals and travel arrangements. Upon arrival, our resort staff serve as ambassadors to engage guests, answer questions and create a customer-focused environment. In addition, we offer guests what we believe is the industry-leading EpicMix application. EpicMix is an online and mobile application that, through radio frequency technology, captures a guest’s activity on the mountain (e.g. number of ski days, vertical feet skied and chairlift activity) and allows a guest to share his or her experience and 
8

accomplishments with family and friends on social networks. Since the initial launch of our EpicMix technology, we have expanded EpicMix to include additional offerings such as EpicMix Time, which allows guests to access real time lift line wait times; EpicMix Academy, which allows our ski school instructors to certify the attainment of certain skills and ski levels; EpicMix Photo, which provides professional photos and allows guests to share photos on social networks; and EpicMix Guide, which uses guest input to provide a customized, step-by-step navigational guide to experience our mountains. Additionally, we introduced the world’s first digital mountain assistant (“EMMA”), which uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to offer information on everything from grooming, lift line wait times and parking, in addition to recommendations on rentals, lessons and dining options.
We also solicit guest feedback through a variety of surveys and results, which are used to ensure high levels of customer satisfaction, understand trends and develop future resort programs and amenities.

• | Season Pass Products

We offer a variety of season pass products for all of our mountain resorts and urban ski areas that are marketed towards both out-of-state and international (“Destination”) guests and in-state and local (“Local”) guests. Our season pass products are available for purchase predominately during the period prior to the start of the ski season, offering our guests a better value in exchange for their commitment to ski at our resorts before the season begins. As such, our season pass program drives strong customer loyalty and mitigates exposure to more weather sensitive guests, leading to greater revenue stability and allowing us to capture valuable guest data. Additionally, our season pass customers typically ski more days each season than those guests who do not buy season passes, which leads to additional ancillary spending. Season pass products generated approximately 47% of our total lift revenue for Fiscal 2018. In addition, our season pass products attract new guests to our mountain resorts and urban ski areas. Sales of season pass products are a key component of our overall Mountain segment revenue and help create strong synergies among our mountain resorts and urban ski areas. Our season pass products range from providing access to one or a combination of our mountain resorts and urban ski areas to our Epic Pass which provides unrestricted and unlimited access to all our mountain resorts and urban ski areas. All of our various season pass options can be found on our consumer website www.snow.com. Information on our websites does not constitute part of this document.
As part of our continued strategy to drive season pass sales and create a stronger connection between key skier markets and our iconic destination mountain resorts, we have continued to expand our portfolio of properties in recent years. Whistler Blackcomb, acquired in October 2016, is a world-renowned international skiing destination which receives more than two million skier visits each year. Stevens Pass in Washington State, acquired in August 2018, receives approximately half a million skier visits each year and is located 85 miles from Seattle and 250 miles from Whistler Blackcomb. We have made strategic acquisitions of mountain resorts located in the Northeast U.S. recently, including Okemo in Vermont (acquired in September 2018), Mount Sunapee in New Hampshire (acquired in September 2018) and Stowe in Vermont (acquired in June 2017). These resorts are premier, high-end ski resorts for skiers and snowboarders on the East Coast, which draw visitors from New York City, Boston and the broader Northeast skier population. In June 2015, we acquired Perisher in Australia, which is also an important international market for ski resorts across the Northern Hemisphere, generating an estimated more than one million skier visits annually to resorts in North America, Japan and Europe. Additionally, our urban ski areas are strategically positioned near key U.S. population centers; Wilmot in Wisconsin near the Chicago and Milwaukee metropolitan areas, Afton Alps in Minnesota near Minneapolis/St. Paul and Mt. Brighton in Michigan near Detroit. This close proximity to major Midwestern skier markets allows guests to visit regularly during the week, including popular night skiing, or on the weekends. These cities offer major airports with routine direct flights to Denver, San Francisco, Salt Lake City and Vancouver. Additionally, we enter into strategic long-term season pass alliance agreements with third-party mountain resorts including Telluride Ski Resort and Arapahoe Basin in Colorado, Hakuba Valley in Japan and Resorts of the Canadian Rockies in Canada, which further increases the value proposition of our season pass products.

• | Premier Ski Schools

Our mountain resorts are home to some of the highest quality and most widely recognized ski and snowboard schools in the industry. Through a combination of outstanding training and abundant work opportunities, our ski schools have become home to many of the most experienced and credentialed professionals in the business. We complement our instructor staff with state-of-the-art facilities and extensive learning terrain, all with a keen attention to guest needs. We offer a wide variety of adult and child group and private lesson options with a goal of creating lifelong skiers and riders and showcasing to our guests all the terrain our resorts have to offer.

• | Dining

Our resorts provide a variety of quality on-mountain and base village dining venues, ranging from top-rated fine dining restaurants to trailside express food service outlets. We operate approximately 215 dining venues at our mountain resorts and urban ski areas.

• | Retail/Rental

We have approximately 290 retail/rental locations specializing in sporting goods including ski, snowboard and cycling equipment. In addition to providing a major retail/rental presence at each of our mountain resorts, we also have retail/rental locations throughout the Colorado Front Range and at other Colorado and California ski resorts, as well as the San Francisco Bay Area, Salt Lake City and Minneapolis. Many of the locations in the Colorado Front Range and in the San Francisco Bay Area also offer prime venues for selling our season pass products.

• | On-Mountain Activities

We are a ski industry leader in providing comprehensive destination vacation experiences, including on-mountain activities designed to appeal to a broad range of interests. In addition to our exceptional ski experiences, guests can choose from a variety of non-ski related activities such as snowtubing, snowshoeing, guided snowmobile and scenic cat tours, backcountry expeditions, horse-drawn sleigh rides and high altitude dining. During the summer season, our mountain resorts offer non-ski related recreational activities and provide guests with a wide array of options including scenic chairlift and gondola rides; mountain biking; horseback riding; guided hiking; 4x4 Jeep tours; and our Epic Discovery program which launched at both Vail Mountain and Heavenly in June 2016 and at Breckenridge in June 2017. The Epic Discovery program encourages “learn through play” by featuring extensive environmental educational elements interspersed between numerous activities, consisting of zip lines, children’s activities, challenge ropes courses, tubing, mountain excursions, an alpine slide and alpine coasters. 

• | Lodging and Real Estate

High quality lodging options are an integral part of providing a complete resort experience. Our owned or managed hotels and resorts proximate to our mountain resorts, including six RockResorts branded properties and a significant inventory of managed condominium units, provide numerous accommodation options for our mountain resort guests. More recently, our real estate efforts have focused on the potential to expand our destination bed base and upgrade our resorts through the sale of land parcels to third-party developers which in turn provides opportunity for the development of condominiums, luxury hotels, parking and commercial space for restaurants and retail shops. Our Lodging and Real Estate segments have and continue to invest in resort related assets and amenities or seek opportunities to expand and enhance the overall resort experience.
Lodging Segment
Our Lodging segment includes the following operations, which collectively offer a wide range of services to guests (additional property details provided in Item 2. Properties):

• | Owned and managed lodging properties, including those under our luxury hotel management company, RockResorts;


• | Managed condominium units which are in and around our mountain resorts in Colorado, Lake Tahoe, Utah, Vermont and British Columbia, Canada;


• | Two NPS concessionaire properties in and near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming;


• | a resort ground transportation company in Colorado; and


• | Company-owned mountain resort golf courses including five in Colorado, one in Wyoming and two in Vermont, as well as two Company-operated mountain golf courses; one in Lake Tahoe, California and one in Park City, Utah.

The Lodging segment currently includes approximately 5,400 owned and managed hotel rooms and condominium units. Our lodging strategy seeks to complement and enhance our mountain resort operations through our ownership or management of lodging properties and condominiums proximate to our mountain resorts and selective management of luxury resorts in premier destination locations.
In addition to our portfolio of owned or managed luxury resort hotels and other hotels and properties, our lodging business also features a Colorado ground transportation company, which represents the first point of contact with many of our guests when they arrive by air to Colorado. We offer year-round ground transportation from Denver International Airport and Eagle County Airport to the Vail Valley (locations in and around Vail, Beaver Creek, Avon and Edwards), Aspen (locations in and around Aspen and Snowmass) and Summit County (which includes Keystone, Breckenridge, Copper Mountain, Frisco and Silverthorne).

Lodging Industry/Market
Hotels are categorized by Smith Travel Research, a leading lodging industry research firm, as luxury, upper upscale, upscale, mid-price and economy. The service quality and level of accommodations of our RockResorts’ hotels place them in the luxury segment, which represents hotels achieving the highest average daily rates (“ADR”) in the industry, and includes such brands as the Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton and Starwood’s Luxury Collection hotels. Our other hotels are categorized in the upper upscale and upscale segments of the hotel market. The luxury and upper upscale segments consist of approximately 736,000 rooms at approximately 2,200 properties in the U.S. as of July 2018. For Fiscal 2018, our owned hotels, which include a combination of certain RockResort hotels as well as other hotels in proximity to our mountain resorts, had an overall ADR of $250.50 a paid occupancy rate of 69.2% and revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) of $173.34, as compared to the upper upscale segment’s ADR of $184.43, a paid occupancy rate of 74.3% and RevPAR of $137.06. We believe that this comparison to the upper upscale segment is appropriate as our mix of owned hotels include those in the luxury and upper upscale segments, as well as certain of our hotels that fall in the upscale segment. The highly seasonal nature of our lodging properties generally results in lower average occupancy as compared to the upper upscale segment of the lodging industry as a whole.
Competition
Competition in the hotel industry is generally based on quality and consistency of rooms, restaurants, meeting facilities and services, the attractiveness of locations, availability of a global distribution system and price. Our properties compete within their geographic markets with hotels and resorts that include locally-owned independent hotels, as well as facilities owned or managed by national and international chains, including such brands as Four Seasons, Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Starwood’s Luxury Collection and Westin. Our properties also compete for convention and conference business across the national market. We believe we are highly competitive in the resort hotel niche for the following reasons:

• | All of our hotels are located in unique, highly desirable resort destinations;


• | Our hotel portfolio has achieved some of the most prestigious hotel designations in the world, including two properties in our portfolio that are currently rated as AAA 4-Diamond;


• | Many of our hotels (both owned and managed) are designed to provide a look that feels indigenous to their surroundings, enhancing the guest’s vacation experience;


• | Each of our RockResorts hotels provides the same high level of quality and services, while still providing unique characteristics which distinguish the resorts from one another. This appeals to travelers looking for consistency in quality and service offerings together with an experience more unique than typically offered by larger luxury hotel chains;


• | Many of the hotels in our portfolio provide a wide array of amenities available to the guest such as access to world-class ski and golf resorts, spa and fitness facilities, water sports and a number of other outdoor activities, as well as highly acclaimed dining options;


• | Conference space with the latest technology is available at most of our hotels. In addition, guests at Keystone can use our company-owned Keystone Conference Center, the largest conference facility in the Colorado Rocky Mountain region with more than 100,000 square feet of meeting, exhibit and function space;


• | We have a central reservations system that leverages off of our mountain resort reservations system and has an online planning and booking platform, offering our guests a seamless and useful way to make reservations at our resorts; and


• | We actively upgrade the quality of the accommodations and amenities available at our hotels through capital improvements. Capital funding for third-party owned properties is provided by the owners of those properties to maintain standards required by our management contracts. Projects at our owned properties completed over the past several years include extensive refurbishments and upgrades to the Grand Summit Hotel, Colter Bay Village Cabins, and DoubleTree by Hilton Breckenridge. Additionally, we have completed guest room renovations at the Keystone Lodge and The Pines Lodge.

National Park Concessionaire Properties
We own GTLC, which is based in the Jackson Hole area in Wyoming and operates within Grand Teton National Park under a 15-year concessionaire agreement with the NPS that expires December 31, 2021. We also own Flagg Ranch, located in Moran, Wyoming and centrally located between Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park on the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway (the “Parkway”). Flagg Ranch operates under a 15-year concessionaire agreement with the NPS that expires October 31, 2026. GTLC also owns Jackson Hole Golf & Tennis Club (“JHG&TC”), located outside Grand Teton National Park near Jackson, Wyoming. GTLC’s operations within Grand Teton National Park and JHG&TC have operating seasons that generally run from June through the end of September.
11

We primarily compete with such companies as Aramark Parks & Resorts, Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts, Forever Resorts and Xanterra Parks & Resorts in retaining and obtaining NPS concessionaire agreements. Four full-service concessionaires provide accommodations within Grand Teton National Park, including GTLC. GTLC offers three lodging options within Grand Teton National Park: Jackson Lake Lodge, a full-service, 385-room resort with 17,000 square feet of conference facilities; Jenny Lake Lodge, a small, rustically elegant retreat with 37 cabins; and Colter Bay Village, a facility with 166 log cabins, 66 tent cabins, 337 campsites and a 112-space RV park. GTLC offers dining options as extensive as its lodging options, with cafeterias, casual eateries and fine dining establishments. GTLC’s resorts provide a wide range of activities for guests to enjoy, including cruises on Jackson Lake, boat rentals, horseback riding, guided fishing, float trips, golf and guided Grand Teton National Park tours. As a result of the extensive amenities offered, as well as the tremendous popularity of the National Park System, GTLC’s accommodations within Grand Teton National Park operate near full capacity during their operating season.
Real Estate Segment
We have extensive holdings of real property at our mountain resorts primarily throughout Summit and Eagle Counties in Colorado. Our real estate operations, through Vail Resorts Development Company (“VRDC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, include planning, oversight, infrastructure improvement, development, marketing and sale of our real property holdings. In addition to the cash flow generated from real estate development sales, these development activities benefit our Mountain and Lodging segments by (1) creating additional resort lodging and other resort related facilities and venues (primarily restaurants, spas, commercial space, private mountain clubs, skier services facilities and parking structures) that provide us with the opportunity to create new sources of recurring revenue, enhance the guest experience and expand our destination bed base; (2) controlling the architectural themes of our resorts; and (3) expanding our property management and commercial leasing operations.
The principal activities of our Real Estate segment include the sale of land parcels to third-party developers and planning for future real estate development projects, including zoning and acquisition of applicable permits. We continue undertaking preliminary planning and design work on future projects and are pursuing opportunities with third-party developers rather than undertaking our own significant vertical development projects. We believe that, due to the low carrying cost of our real estate land investments, we are well situated to promote future projects with third-party developers while limiting our financial risk. 
Marketing and Sales
Our Mountain segment’s marketing and sales efforts are increasingly oriented around data analytics to drive targeted and personalized marketing to our existing and prospective guests. We capture guest data on the vast majority of guest transactions through our season pass program, e-commerce platforms including mobile lift ticket sales, the EpicMix application and operational processes at our lift ticket windows. We promote our resorts through customer relationship marketing to targeted audiences via email and direct mail, promotional programs, digital marketing (including social, search and display) and traditional media advertising where appropriate (e.g. targeted print, TV, radio). We also have marketing programs directed at attracting groups, corporate meetings and convention business. Most marketing efforts drive traffic to our websites, where we provide our guests with information regarding each of our resorts, including services and amenities, reservations information, virtual tours and the opportunity to book/purchase multiple products for their vacations or other visits.  We also enter into strategic alliances with companies to enhance the guest in-resort experience and to create opportunities for cross-marketing.
For our Lodging segment, we promote our hotels and lodging properties through marketing and sales programs, which include marketing directly to many of our guests through our digital channels (search, social and display), promotional programs and print media advertising. We also promote comprehensive vacation experiences through various package offerings and promotions (combining lodging, lift tickets, ski school lessons, ski rental equipment, transportation and dining), all of which are designed to drive traffic to our websites and central reservations call center. Sales made through our websites and call center allow us to transact directly with our guests, enabling us to further expand our customer base for future analytics and marketing. Where appropriate, we market our resort properties in conjunction with our mountain resort marketing efforts. Additionally, our individual hotels have active sales forces to generate conference and group business.
Seasonality
Ski resort operations are highly seasonal in nature, with a typical ski season in North America generally beginning in mid-November and running through mid-April. In an effort to partially mitigate the concentration of our revenue in the winter months in North America, we offer several non-ski related activities in the summer months such as sightseeing, mountain biking, guided hiking, 4x4 Jeep tours, golf (included in the operations of the Lodging segment) and our Epic Discovery program. These activities also help attract destination conference and group business to our resorts in our off-season. In addition, the operating results of Perisher, with its ski season from June through early October, partially counterbalance the concentration of our revenues during this seasonally low period. 
12

Our lodging business is also highly seasonal in nature, with peak seasons primarily in the winter months (with the exception of GTLC, Flagg Ranch, certain managed properties and mountain resort golf operations). We actively promote our extensive conference facilities and have added more off-season activities to help offset the seasonality of our lodging business. Additionally, we operate ten golf courses: The Canyons Golf Course at Park City, The Beaver Creek Golf Club, The Keystone Ranch Golf Course, The River Course at Keystone, JHG&TC near Jackson, Wyoming, The Northstar Resort Golf Course, the Tom Fazio and Greg Norman courses at Red Sky Ranch near the Beaver Creek Resort and the Okemo Valley Golf Club and Tater Hill Golf Club in Vermont.
Environmental Stewardship and Social Responsibility
Environmental stewardship is a core philosophy for us. Our resorts operate in some of the world’s greatest natural environments, and we are compelled to care for and conserve them. Through our corporate social responsibility and sustainability program, Epic Promise, we focus on resource conservation, forest health and building stronger local communities through contributions to local non-profit organizations. Our environmental stewardship efforts are diverse and touch nearly every area of our operations. In 2017, we launched our Commitment to Zero, a pledge to have a net zero operating footprint by 2030. This commitment includes achieving zero net emissions by finding operational energy efficiencies and investing in renewable energy, zero waste to landfills by diverting 100 percent of waste from our operations and zero net operating impact to forests and wildlife habitat by restoring an acre of forest for every acre displaced by our operations. 
As a result of this commitment, Vail Resorts was accepted as the first travel and tourism company into RE100, a collaborative initiative uniting more than 100 global and influential businesses which are committed to 100 percent renewable electricity. In addition, we have partnered with several organizations to help raise resources for local environmental programs, including The Nature Conservancy, the National Forest Foundation, The Tahoe Fund, Mountain Trails Foundation in Park City and the EnviroFund at Whistler Blackcomb. We encourage our employees to help protect the environment and support their local community with over 20,000 volunteer hours donated annually. Our charitable giving focuses on supporting education and youth programs, encouraging innovation in, and implementation of, environmental stewardship practices and enhancing the quality of life in the communities in which we operate.
Finally, our EpicPromise Foundation (the “Foundation”), which was established in 2015, is a private charitable foundation funded by annual contributions from the Company and its employees. The Foundation supports all Vail Resorts’ employees and their families via grants for emergency relief and scholarships. For more information on both the Foundation and our environmental stewardship, visit www.EpicPromise.com. Information on our websites does not constitute part of this document.
Employees
At fiscal year end, we employed approximately 6,100 year-round employees. During the height of our most recent operating seasons, we employed approximately 27,200 additional seasonal employees. In addition, we employed approximately 400 year-round employees and 100 seasonal employees on behalf of the owners of our managed hotel properties. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Intellectual Property
The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property as an important element of our success. Accordingly, we protect our intellectual property rights and seek to protect against its unauthorized use through international, national and state laws and common law rights. We file applications for and obtain trademark registrations and have filed for patents to protect inventions and will continue to do so where appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions.
In the highly competitive industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are very important in the sales and marketing of our mountain resorts and urban ski areas, lodging properties and services. We seek to register and protect our trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos and have obtained a significant number of registrations for those trademarks. We believe our brands have become synonymous in the travel and leisure industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality. Among other national and international trademark registrations, the Company owns U.S. federal registrations for Epic®, Epic Pass®, Vail Resorts®, Vail®, Beaver Creek®, Breckenridge® and Heavenly®. The Company also owns Canadian and U.S. trademark registrations for the Whistler Blackcomb® name and logo. The Company licenses the right to use the federally registered trademark Northstar California® from CLP Northstar, LLC.

Regulation and Legislation
U.S. Forest Service Resorts
Federal Regulation
The operations of Breckenridge, Vail Mountain, Keystone, Beaver Creek, Crested Butte, Stevens Pass, Heavenly and Kirkwood are conducted primarily on land under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service (collectively, the “Forest Service Resorts”). The 1986 Ski Area Permit Act (the “1986 Act”) allows the Forest Service to grant Term Special Use Permits (each, a “SUP”) for the operation of ski areas and construction of related facilities on National Forest lands. In November 2011, the 1986 Act was amended by the Ski Area Recreational Opportunity Enhancement Act (the “Enhancement Act”) to clarify the Forest Service’s authority to approve facilities primarily for year-round recreation. Under the 1986 Act, the Forest Service has the authority to review and approve the location, design and construction of improvements in the permit area and many operational matters.
Each individual national forest is required by the National Forest Management Act to develop and maintain a Land and Resource Management Plan (a “Forest Plan”), which establishes standards and guidelines for the Forest Service to follow and consider in reviewing and approving our proposed actions.
Special Use Permits
Each of the Forest Service Resorts operates under a SUP, and the acreage and expiration date information for each SUP is as follows:

Forest Service Resort | Acres | Expiration Date 
Breckenridge | 5,702 | December 31, 2029 
Vail Mountain | 12,353 | December 1, 2031 
Keystone | 8,376 | December 31, 2032 
Beaver Creek | 3,849 | November 8, 2039 
Crested Butte | 4,350 | September 27, 2058
Stevens Pass | 2,443 | August 15, 2058 
Heavenly | 7,050 | May 1, 2042 
Kirkwood | 2,330 | March 1, 2052 

We anticipate requesting a new SUP for each Forest Service Resort prior to its expiration date as provided by Forest Service regulations and the terms of each existing SUP. We are not aware of the Forest Service refusing to issue a new SUP to replace an expiring SUP for a ski resort in operation at the time of expiration. The Forest Service can also terminate a SUP if it determines that termination is required in the public interest. However, to our knowledge, no SUP has ever been terminated by the Forest Service over the opposition of the permit holder.
Each SUP contains a number of requirements, including indemnifying the Forest Service from third-party claims arising out of our operation under the SUP and compliance with applicable laws, such as those relating to water quality and endangered or threatened species. For use of the land authorized by the SUPs, we pay a fee to the Forest Service ranging from 1.5% to 4.0% of adjusted gross revenue for activities authorized by the SUPs. Included in the calculation are sales from, among other things, lift tickets, season passes, ski school lessons, food and beverage, certain summer activities, equipment rentals and retail merchandise.
The SUPs may be revised or amended to accommodate changes initiated by us or by the Forest Service to change the permit area or permitted uses. The Forest Service may amend a SUP if it determines that such amendment is in the public interest. While the Forest Service is required to seek the permit holder’s consent to any amendment, an amendment can be finalized over a permit holder’s objection. Permit amendments must be consistent with the Forest Plan and are subject to the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), both of which are discussed below.
14

Master Development Plans
The 1986 Act requires a Master Development Plan (“MDP”) for each ski area that is granted a SUP, and all improvements that we propose to make on National Forest System lands under any of our SUPs must be included in a MDP, which describes the existing and proposed facilities, developments and area of activity within the permit area. The MDPs are reviewed by the Forest Service for compliance with the Forest Plan and other applicable laws and, if found to be compliant, are accepted by the Forest Service. Notwithstanding acceptance by the Forest Service of the conceptual MDPs, individual projects still require separate applications and compliance with NEPA and other applicable laws before the Forest Service will approve such projects. We update or amend our MDPs for our Forest Service Resorts from time to time. 
Private Land Resorts
The operations of Park City, Northstar, Afton Alps, Mt. Brighton and Wilmot are conducted primarily on private land and are not under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service (collectively, the “Private Land Resorts”). While Beaver Creek also operates on Forest Service land, a significant portion of the skiable terrain, primarily in the lower main mountain, Western Hillside, Bachelor Gulch and Arrowhead Mountain areas, is located on land that we own.
Although not governed by federal regulation, the Private Land Resorts may be governed by local laws and regulations. For example, specific projects and master development plans at Northstar require approval by Placer County, California. Additionally, a portion of Park City is part of the Canyons Specially Planned Area (“SPA”) pursuant to a Summit County, Utah ordinance adopted in 1998, and a Development Agreement and Master Development Plan with affected property owners, developers and the county, the most recent versions of which were adopted in 1999. Other land use within the SPA is within the jurisdiction of Summit County, Utah. Land use at Park City is within the jurisdiction of Summit County, Utah and Park City Municipal Corporation. The portions of the resort located within Park City Municipal Corporation are subject to a Development Agreement with the municipality, the most recent version of which was entered into in 1998.
Whistler Blackcomb
Whistler Blackcomb is made up of two mountains: Whistler Mountain and Blackcomb Mountain. Whistler Mountain and Blackcomb Mountain are located on Crown Land within the traditional territory of the Squamish and Lil’wat Nations. The relationship between Whistler Blackcomb and Her Majesty, the Queen in Right of British Columbia (the “Province”) is largely governed by Master Development Agreements (the “MDAs”) between the Province and Whistler Mountain Resort Limited Partnership (“Whistler LP”) with respect to Whistler Mountain, and between the Province and Blackcomb Skiing Enterprises Limited Partnership (“Blackcomb LP”) with respect to Blackcomb Mountain. Together, Whistler LP and Blackcomb LP are referred to as the “Partnerships.”
The MDAs, which were entered into in February 2017, have a term of 60 years (expiring on February 23, 2077) and are replaceable for an additional 60 years by option exercisable by the Partnerships after the first 30 years of the initial term. In accordance with the MDAs, the Partnerships are obligated to pay annual fees to the Province at a percentage of gross revenues related to the operation of certain activities at Whistler Blackcomb.
The MDAs require that each of the mountains be developed, operated and maintained in accordance with its respective master plan, which contains requirements as to matters such as trail design and development, passenger lift development and environmental concerns. The MDAs grant a general license to use the Whistler Mountain lands and the Blackcomb Mountain lands for the operation and development of the Whistler Blackcomb. The MDAs also provide for the granting of specific tenures of land owned by the Province to the Whistler LP or the Blackcomb LP, as applicable, by way of rights-of-way, leases or licenses. Each Partnership is permitted to develop new improvements to Whistler Mountain or Blackcomb Mountain, as the case may be, within standard municipal type development control conditions. We are obligated to indemnify the Province from third-party claims arising out of our operations under the MDAs.

Northeast Resorts
Stowe and Okemo operate partially on land that we own and partially on land we lease from the State of Vermont. With respect to Stowe, the land we own is on the Spruce Peak side of the resort while the land we lease from the State of Vermont is located on Mt. Mansfield in the Mt. Mansfield State Forest. The initial ten year term of the lease commenced in June 1967, and the lease provides for eight separate ten year extension options. The current term of the lease extends through June 2027, and there are three remaining ten year extension options. With respect to Okemo, we own the Jackson Gore base area land and lease most of the skiable terrain from the State of Vermont. The initial ten year term of the lease commenced in December 1963, and the lease provides for eight separate ten year extension options. The current term of the lease extends through December 2023, and there are three remaining ten year extension options. Under both leases, the land can be used for the development and operation of a ski area including ski trails, ski lifts, warming shelters, restaurants and maintenance facilities. For use of the land under the leases, we pay a fee to the State of Vermont based on revenue for activities authorized by the lease, such as lift tickets, season passes, food and beverage, summer activities and retail merchandise. We are obligated to indemnify the State of Vermont from third-party claims arising out of our operations under the lease.
Mount Sunapee lies within the Mount Sunapee State Park and operates on land that we lease from the State of New Hampshire. The initial twenty year term of the lease commenced in July 1998, and the lease provides for three separate ten year extension options. The current term of the lease extends through June 2028, and there are two remaining ten year extension options. The land can be managed and operated as a ski area and summer recreational facility, including all of its support activities, to provide year-round outdoor recreation. For use of the land under the lease, we pay a fee to the State of New Hampshire that includes both a base fee and a fee based on revenue from activities authorized by the lease, such as lift tickets, season passes, food and beverage, summer activities and retail merchandise. We are obligated to indemnify the State of New Hampshire from third-party claims arising out of our operations under the lease.
Perisher
Perisher is located in the Kosciuszko National Park, the largest national park in New South Wales, Australia. The resort includes four villages (Perisher Valley, Smiggin Holes, Guthega and Blue Cow) and their associated ski fields, as well as the site of the Skitube Alpine Railway at Bullock’s Flat, which is accredited in accordance with the Rail Safety National Law (NSW) No. 82a. The Office of Environment and Heritage (“OEH”), an agency of the New South Wales government, which is part of the Department of Planning and Environment, is responsible for the protection and conservation of the Kosciuszko National Park. The National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 (NSW) (“NPW Act”) establishes the National Parks and Wildlife Service and is responsible for the control and management of the Kosciusko National Park.
The NPW Act requires the Kosciuszko National Park to be managed in accordance with the principles specified in that legislation, including the provision for sustainable visitor or tourist use and enjoyment that is compatible with the conservation of the national park’s natural and cultural values. The legislation also authorizes the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Heritage (the “Minister”) to grant leases and licenses of land within the Kosciuszko National Park for various purposes, including for purposes related to sustainable visitor or tourist use and enjoyment. Under this power, the Minister has granted to Perisher a lease and a license of specified land within the Kosciusko National Park until June 30, 2048, with an option to renew for an additional period of 20 years. The Minister has also granted Perisher a lease of the parking lot at Perisher Valley that expires on December 31, 2025. Subject to certain conditions being met, the lease for the Perisher Valley parking lot can be extended until June 30, 2048, with an option to renew for a further 20 years. The lease and license provide for the payment of a minimum annual base rent with periodic increases in base rent over the term, turnover rent payments based on a percentage of certain gross revenue, remittance of park user fees and certain other charges, also subject to periodic increases over the term.
Concessionaire Agreements
GTLC operates three lodging properties, food and beverage services, retail, camping and other services within the Grand Teton National Park under a concessionaire agreement with the NPS. Our concessionaire agreement with the NPS for GTLC expires on December 31, 2021, and we pay a fee to the NPS of a percentage of the majority of our sales occurring in Grand Teton National Park. 
Flagg Ranch Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, provides lodging, food and beverage services, retail, service station, recreation and other services on the Parkway located between Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone National Park. Our concession contract with the NPS for the Parkway expires on October 31, 2026, and we pay a fee to the NPS of a percentage of the majority of our sales occurring in the Parkway. 
16

Upon expiration of these concession contracts, we will have to bid against other prospective concessionaires for award of a new contract. The NPS may suspend operations under the concession contract at any time if the NPS determines it is necessary to protect visitors or resources within the Grand Teton National Park or during a Federal Government shutdown. NPS may also terminate the concession contract for breach, following notice and a 15 day cure period or if it believes termination is necessary to protect visitors or resources within the Grand Teton National Park.
Environmental Regulations
National Environmental Policy Act; California Environmental Quality Act
NEPA requires an assessment of the environmental impacts of “significant” proposed actions on National Forest land, such as expansion of a ski area, installation of new lifts or snowmaking facilities or construction of new trails or buildings. We must comply with NEPA when seeking Forest Service approval of such improvements, except in limited cases where projects are not expected to have environmental impacts, which can be submitted to a Categorical Exclusion. The Forest Service is responsible for preparing and compiling the required environmental studies, usually through third-party consultants. NEPA allows for different types of environmental studies, depending on, among other factors, the scope and size of the expected impact of the proposed project. An Environmental Assessment (“EA”) is typically used for projects where the environmental impacts are expected to be limited. For projects with more significant expected impacts, an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) is more commonly required. An EIS is more detailed and broader in scope than an EA. 
During the requisite environmental study, the Forest Service is required to analyze alternatives to the proposed action (including not taking the proposed action), as well as impacts that may be unavoidable. Following completion of the requisite environmental study, the Forest Service may decide not to approve the proposed action or may decide to approve an alternative. In either case, we may be forced to abandon or alter our development or expansion plans.
Proposed actions at Kirkwood, Northstar and certain portions of Heavenly may also be subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”), which is similar to NEPA in that it requires the California governmental entity approving any proposed action at Kirkwood, Northstar, or on the California portion of Heavenly to study potential environmental impacts. Projects with significant expected impacts require an Environmental Impact Report while more limited projects may be approved based on a Mitigated Negative Declaration.
Forest & Range Practices Act and Watershed Sustainability Act
The Forest & Range Practices Act (“FRPA”) is the principal legislation that governs mountain resorts in British Columbia, including Whistler Blackcomb. The FRPA outlines how all forest and range practices and resource-based activities are to be conducted on Crown (Public) land in British Columbia, while ensuring protection of everything in and on the lands, such as plants, animals and ecosystems. All forest and range licensees’ activities are governed by FRPA and its regulations during all stages of planning, road building, logging, and reforestation, including removing timber for ski trail development. The FRPA is mostly based on self-compliance and does not specifically express standards for ski area development. Whistler Blackcomb is also subject to the Watershed Sustainability Act (“WSA”), which is the principal law for managing the diversion and use of water resources in British Columbia and is applicable to Whistler Blackcomb’s use of water for drinking consumption and snowmaking. The WSA requires Whistler Blackcomb to obtain certain approvals and conduct monitoring of its streams.
Vermont Land Use and Development Act
Specifically, in Vermont, the operations of Stowe and Okemo are subject to Vermont’s state-wide Land Use and Development Act known as “Act 250.” Act 250, administered by the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, regulates the impacts of development to, among other things, waterways, air, wildlife and earth resources using ten criteria that are designed to safeguard the environment, community life and aesthetic character of Vermont. Stowe and Okemo each have a Master Plan detailing the development considerations within the resort boundary. All projects within each resort’s Master Plan have completed or will need to complete the Act 250 review process at the project level.
Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW, Australia)
The Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) (“EPA Act”) is the principal legislation regulating land use and development in New South Wales, Australia. Perisher relies on a suite of planning approvals (and existing use rights) granted under the EPA Act to operate the resort. Various types of development that facilitate commercial ski resort operations are also permitted to be carried out without planning approval pursuant to the State Environmental Planning Policy (Kosciusko National Park - Alpine Resorts) 2007 and the Snowy River Local Environmental Plan 2013. Strategic planning documents have been adopted 
17

to provide a framework for the assessment and approval of future development at the resort, including the Perisher Range Resorts Master Plan, Perisher Blue Ski Resort Ski Slope Master Plan and Kosciuszko National Park Plan of Management. Perisher holds a number of environmental approvals to regulate its operations, including an environment protection license for the sewage treatment plant at Bullock’s Flat and a suite of licenses for the storage of diesel, heating oil and propane in storage tanks across the resort. Perisher implemented an Environmental Management System to manage compliance with the environmental regulatory framework, and mitigate potential environmental risks arising from its operations.
State, Local and Other Regulations
Various federal, state, local and provincial regulations also govern our resort operations, including liquor licensing and food safety regulations applicable to our food and beverage operations and safety standards relating to our lift operations and heli-ski operations at Whistler Blackcomb. In addition, each resort is subject to and must comply with state, county, regional and local government land use regulations and restrictions, including, for example, employee housing ordinances, zoning and density restrictions, noise ordinances, and wildlife, water and air quality regulations. 
Water and Snowmaking
We rely on a supply of water for operation of our ski areas for domestic and snowmaking purposes and for real estate development. Availability of water depends on existence of adequate water rights, as well as physical delivery of the water when and where it is needed. To provide a level of predictability in dates of operation and favorable snow surface conditions at our ski areas, we rely on snowmaking, which requires a significant volume of water, most of which is viewed as a non-consumptive use. Approximately 80% of the water is returned to the watershed at spring runoff. Examples of our water sources include:

• | In Colorado, we own or have ownership interests in water rights in reservoir companies, reservoirs, surface streams, groundwater wells and other sources.


• | Park City receives water for snowmaking from the Park City Municipal Corporation and Summit Water Distribution Company pursuant to various long-term agreements.


• | Whistler Blackcomb receives water rights used for snowmaking through licenses from the Province which describe annual allowable volumes on a number of its mountain creeks, and Whistler Blackcomb typically uses only a small percentage of its licensed water.


• | Heavenly’s primary sources of water purchased for domestic and snowmaking uses are the South Tahoe Public Utility District and Kingsbury General Improvement District, which are California and Nevada utilities, respectively.


• | Northstar obtains water through a cooperative arrangement with the Northstar Community Services District (“NCSD”). Together with the NCSD, we, through our lease with affiliates of EPR Properties, control surface water rights that we use for snowmaking.


• | Kirkwood co-owns with the Forest Service surface water rights sufficient for current and planned snowmaking at the resort. Kirkwood’s water is stored in nearby Caples Lake under contract with its owner/operator.


• | Afton Alps, Mt. Brighton and Wilmot rely on on-site water wells and reservoirs for snowmaking.


• | Perisher is also subject to the Water Act of 1912 (NSW) (“NSW Water Act”), which regulates the use of water sources (such as rivers, lakes and groundwater aquifers) in the Kosciuszko National Park. Perisher relies on six water licenses issued under the NSW Water Act and a water extraction agreement with an independent third party for the purposes of extracting water for snowmaking.
