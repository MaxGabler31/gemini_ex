ITEM 1. Business
General

We are a California-based cannabis company with vertically integrated operations including large scale cultivation, extraction, processing, manufacturing, branding, packaging and wholesale distribution to retail dispensaries. We manufacture and distribute proprietary and select third-party brands throughout the State of California, the largest cannabis market in the world. We also provide manufacturing, extraction and distribution services to select third-party cannabis and cannabis branding companies and sell proprietary bulk flower and broker third-party bulk flower to licensed distribution and manufacturing companies in California.

On February 25, 2021, we acquired the Lowell Herb Co. and Lowell Smokes trademark brands, product portfolio and production assets from The Hacienda Company and its subsidiaries (the “Lowell Acquisition”). The Lowell Acquisition expanded our product offerings by adding a highly regarded, mature line of premium branded cannabis pre-rolls, including infused pre-rolls, to our product portfolio under the Lowell Herb Co. and Lowell Smokes brands. The Lowell Acquisition also expanded our offerings of premium packaged flower, concentrates, and vape products. We believe our pre-existing strengths in cultivation and sourcing will enhance the value of the brands and products acquired in the Lowell Acquisition. Additionally, we presently license the Lowell Herb Co. and Lowell Smokes brands to Ascend Wellness Holdings, LLC at their retail locations in Illinois and Massachusetts, and are in discussion with regard to Michigan.

The Lowell Acquisition also substantially broadened our customer base by adding highly developed direct-to-consumer channels to complement our pre-existing network of retail dispensary customers. This addition to our customer base has resulted in broader geographic coverage in California by the combined business.

On June 29, 2021, we announced the C Quadrant Acquisition, pursuant to which we acquired real property and related assets of a cannabis drying and midstream processing facility located in Monterey County, nearby our flagship cultivation operation. The 10-acre, 40,000 square foot processing facility provides drying, bucking, trimming, sorting, grading, and packaging operations for up to 250,000 pounds of wholesale cannabis flower annually. The new facility will process nearly all the cannabis that we grow at our existing cultivation operations. Additionally, we have commissioned the Lowell Farm Services (“LFS”) business unit, which engages in fee-based processing services for regional growers throughout California.

In addition to the processing facility acquired in the C Quadrant Acquisition, we operate a 225,000 square foot greenhouse cultivation facility in Monterey County, a 15,000 square foot manufacturing and laboratory facility in Salinas, California, a separate 20,000 square foot distribution facility in Salinas, California and a warehouse depot and distribution vehicles in Los Angeles, California.

Product Offerings

Our product offerings include flower, vape pens, oils, extracts, chocolate edibles, mints, gummies, tinctures and pre-rolls. We sell our products under owned and third-party brands.

Brands we own include the following:


o | Lowell Herb Co. and Lowell Smokes - premium packaged flower, pre-roll, concentrates, and vape products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | House Weed – a value driven flower, vape and concentrates offering, delivering a flavorful and potent experience with dependable quality. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | Kaizen – a premium brand offering a full spectrum of cannabis concentrates. 
o | Moon – offers a range of cannabis bars, bites and fruit chews in a variety of flavors, focusing on high- potency, high-quality and high-value. 


o | Original Pot Company – infuses its baked edibles with high quality cannabis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

o | Cypress Reserve – a premium flower brand reserved for the Company’s highest potency harvests from its greenhouses.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Flavor Extracts – provides crumble and terp sugar (which is an edible cannabis product with isolated and enhanced flavor and aromas) products that are hand-selected for optimum flavor and premium color.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Lowell Herb Co. and Lowell Smokes brands were acquired in the Lowell Acquisition. Our remaining brands were developed prior to such acquisition.

We exclusively manufacture and distribute Dr. May tinctures and topicals in California. We also provide third party extraction processing and third-party distribution services, and bulk extraction concentrates and flower to licensed manufacturers and distributors. Our focus during 2021 was on our owned brands and limiting the number of third-party brands manufactured and distributed. The Lowell Acquisition is a significant expansion of this strategy.

Cultivation

We conduct cannabis cultivation operations located in Monterey County, California. We currently operate a cultivation facility which includes four greenhouses totaling approximately 225,000 square feet sited on 10 acres located on Zabala Road. Farming cannabis at this scale enables us to curate specialized strains and maintain greater control over the quantity and quality of cannabis available for our products, preserving the consistency of our flower and cannabis feedstocks for our extraction laboratory and product manufacturing operations.

The first harvest was in the third quarter of calendar 2017. In 2021 we completed a series of facility upgrades to our greenhouses and supporting infrastructure, which will increase facility output approximately four times from that generated in 2019. These facility improvements include separate grow rooms configured with drop-shades, supplemental lighting, upgraded electrical capability with environmental controls and automated fertigation, and raised gutter height in two of the greenhouses. We harvested approximately 9,000, 17,000 and 32,000 pounds of flower in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and are currently projecting to harvest between 35,000 and 40,000 pounds in 2022 as a result of these facility upgrades and improvements. We have invested approximately $7.2 million in our greenhouse renovations to date. The completion and commissioning of the renovated greenhouses is expected to further reduce unit costs of cultivation and make available additional cannabis flower and feedstocks for our extraction and processing, packaging and distribution operations. In 2022 we expect to complete the headhouse which will include redundant drying and processing capacity should LFS reach processing capacity during the fall outdoor harvesting season.

We maintain a strict quality control process which facilitates a predictable output yield of pesticide-free products.

Extraction

Extraction operations were first launched by us in the third quarter of 2017 with the commissioning of our 5,000 square foot licensed laboratory within our Salinas manufacturing facility. The lab contains six separate rooms that can each house one independent closed loop volatile extraction machine (meaning that the machine does not expose the products to open air), which are designed to process the cannabis through the application of hydrocarbon or ethanol solvents, to extract certain concentrated resins and oils from the dried cannabis. This process is known as volatile extraction, which is an efficient and rapid method of extracting cannabis. These resins, oils and concentrates are sold as ingestible products known as “shatter,” rosin, wax, sugar, diamonds, “caviar,” and “crumble”.

4


We currently own and operate five closed loop volatile extraction machines, each housed in a separate room, and each having the capacity to process approximately 100 pounds of dry product per day yielding approximately 5 kilograms of cannabis concentrates. We also currently own and operate 14 purge ovens to work in conjunction with the 5 extraction units in the laboratory. Purge ovens, also known as vacuum ovens, are used after the processing by the extraction units to remove the solvents from the end-product in a low pressure and high heat environment.

In 2021 we commenced solventless extraction activities with the capacity to process approximately 120 pounds of biomass daily yielding approximately 4 kilograms of cannabis concentrates. We currently own and operate one extraction unit which works in conjunction with 5 freeze dryers, 2 ice machines, 3 water filtration systems, 1 UV sterilizer, 2 rosin presses and an 80 square foot walk-in freezer. The solventless process yields a superior product to the volatile extraction process and is the fastest growing category in concentrates. 

The extraction operations utilize cannabis feedstocks from our cultivation site, supplemented with feedstock acquired from multiple third-party cultivations. Concentrate production is packaged as branded extracts, such as crumble, shatter, wax and sugar for distribution, incorporated into its manufactured edible products and sold in bulk to other licensed enterprises. In addition, extraction is provided on a fee-based service on third-party material.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing facility is located in Salinas, California and houses our edible product operations and extraction and distillation operations. The edible product operations utilize internally produced cannabis oil, which can also be supplied from multiple external sources. Our manufacturing operations produce a wide variety of cannabis-infused products and occupies 10,000 square feet in our 15,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Salinas. Our products include chocolate confections, baked goods, hard and soft non-chocolate confections, and topical lotions and balms. Lowell Farms utilizes modern commercial production equipment and employs food grade manufacturing protocols, including industry-leading standard operating procedures designed so that its products meet stringent quality standards. We have implemented updated compliance, packaging and labeling standards to meet all regulatory requirements, including the California Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act.

We also operate an automated flower filling and packaging line and an automated pre-roll assembly line for making finished goods in those respective categories with feedstock grown by the Lowell Farms cultivation operations.

Processing

On June 29, 2021 we announced that we acquired real property and related assets of a cannabis drying and midstream processing facility located in Monterey County, nearby our flagship cultivation operation. The 10-acre, 40,000 square foot processing facility provides drying, bucking, trimming, sorting, grading, and packaging operations for up to 250,000 pounds of wholesale cannabis flower annually. The new facility processes nearly all the cannabis that we grow at our existing cultivation operations. Additionally, we commissioned the new business unit LFS, which engages in fee-based processing services for regional growers from primarily the Salinas Valley area, one of the largest and fastest growing cannabis cultivation regions in the country, as well as throughout California. LFS operations became operational during the third quarter of 2021.
Distribution and Distribution Services

We have a primary distribution center, warehouse and packing facility located in Salinas, California and a service center and distribution depot in Los Angeles, California. We provide physical warehousing and delivery to retail dispensary customers throughout the State of California for our manufactured products as well as third party branded products distributed on behalf of other licensed product manufacturers. Deliveries are made daily to over 80% of the licensed dispensaries in California utilizing a fleet of 21 owned and leased vehicles. We provide warehousing, delivery, customer service and collection services for select third-party brands. We will increase our fleet of vehicles as necessary to meet delivery requirements from increased proprietary and third-party brand sales.

5

Technology Platform

We maintain an automated, on-demand supply chain logistics platform, utilizing e-commerce, enterprise resource planning and other technology to manage product movement, order taking and logistics needs.
Inventory Management

We have comprehensive inventory management procedures, which are compliant with the rules set forth by the California Department of Cannabis Control (formerly the California Department of Consumer Affairs’ Bureau of Cannabis Control) and all other applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, and other requirements. These procedures ensure strict control over Lowell Farms’ cannabis and cannabis product inventory from cultivation or manufacture to sale and delivery to a licensed dispensary, distributor or manufacturer, or disposal as cannabis waste. Such inventory management procedures also include measures to prevent contamination and maintain the quality of the products cultivated, manufactured or distributed.
Sources, Pricing and Availability of Raw Materials, Component Parts or Finished Products

We presently source flower feedstock for sale primarily from our cultivation facility. We have developed relationships with local cannabis growers whereby flower quantities are readily available at competitive prices should the sourcing need arise. We source our biomass needs in extraction from our cultivation facility and from third-party suppliers. Remaining biomass material is readily available from multiple sources at competitive prices. Lowell Farms manufactures substantially all cannabis oil and distillate needs from its internal extraction operations. A small amount of specialized cannabis oil is procured from multiple external sources at competitive prices. Lowell Farms manufactures all finished goods for its proprietary brands. Third party distributed brand product is sourced directly from third party partners.
U.S. Cannabis Market 

The emergence of the legal cannabis sector in the United States, both for medical and adult use, has been rapid as more states adopt regulations for its production and sale. A majority of Americans now live in a state where cannabis is legal in some form and approximately one-third of the population lives in states in which adult or recreational use is permitted as a matter of, and in accordance with, applicable state and local laws.1 According to Fortune Business Insights, the global legal marijuana market is anticipated to reach a value of US$97.35 billion by the end of 2026 from US$10.60 billion in 2018. The market is predicted to rise at a compounded annual growth rate of 32.6% during the period 2019 to 2026.2

The use of cannabis and cannabis derivatives to treat or alleviate the symptoms of a wide variety of chronic conditions, while not recognized by the FDA, has been accepted by a majority of citizens with a growing acceptance by the medical community. A review of the research, published in 2015 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found solid evidence that cannabis can treat pain and muscle spasms.3 The pain component is particularly important, because other studies have suggested that cannabis can replace pain patients’ use of highly addictive, potentially deadly opiates.4 Although hemp, defined as cannabis and derivatives of cannabis with not more than 0.3% THC, has been descheduled from the Controlled Substances Act, the FDA has regulatory oversight over foods drugs and cosmetics containing such products under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act of 1938. It is possible that as the federal and state agencies legalize certain products, the FDA may issue rules and regulations, including good manufacturing practices related to the growth, cultivation, harvesting and processing of such products, even if they are not marketed as drugs. It is also possible that the FDA would require that facilities where medical-use cannabis is grown to register with the FDA and comply with certain federally prescribed regulations, certifications, testing, or other requirements. The potential impact on the cannabis industry is uncertain and could include the imposition of new costs, requirements, and prohibitions.

Although we are not currently engaged in the production or distribution of medical marijuana products, the FDA has exerted regulatory oversight over hemp-derived CBD products, especially as it pertains to packaging and labeling requirements under the Food & Drug Cometic Act. The FDA is currently taking action in the form of Warning Letters, but may also take more extreme enforcement such as recalls, disgorgement or penalties. If we are unable to comply with regulations or facility registration as prescribed by the FDA, it may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Polls conducted throughout the United States consistently show overwhelming support for the legalization of medical cannabis, together with strong majority support for the full legalization of recreational adult-use cannabis. As of November 11, 2019, “Around nine-in-ten Americans favor legalization for recreational or medical purposes” and “Only fewer than one-in-ten say it should not be legal.”5 These are large increases in public support over the past 40 years in favor of legal cannabis use.

Currently, in the United States, the majority of states, as well as the territories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis in some form, and 18 states — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia — have legalized cannabis for adult or recreational use. 

With respect to medical marijuana, as more research centers study the effects of cannabis-based products in treating or addressing therapeutic needs, and assuming that research findings demonstrate that such products are effective in doing so, management believes that the size of the U.S. medical cannabis market will also continue to grow as more States expand their medical marijuana programs and new States legalize medical marijuana. Although the Company only operates in the State of California, it may seek opportunities to expand into other States within the United States that have legalized cannabis use either medicinally or recreationally.

Notwithstanding the fact that a majority of states and the District of Columbia have now legalized adult-use and/or medical cannabis, cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law with cannabis listed as a Schedule I drug under the CSA. See “United States Regulatory Environment”.
Growth Strategy

While the legalization of cannabis throughout the United States continues to expand both in the adult use (recreational) and medical markets, and the size of the U.S. cannabis market will continue to provide growth opportunities, management believes that focusing on the substantial California market and becoming profitable and self-sustaining is the appropriate near-term growth strategy for the Company.

We plan to capitalize on the significant increase in cannabis consumption in California through the robust marketing of the recently acquired Lowell branded products and our other proprietary brands, the continued expansion of our brand and distribution footprint and the exploitation of our increased cultivation capacity. We will selectively seek opportunities to further expand our brands and operations in California through acquisitions or alliances. We currently license the Lowell brand in Illinois and Massachusetts and we plan on exploring additional licensing of our marque Lowell brand in additional states.

We may also seek to expand our cultivation footprint within California by either purchasing an existing cultivation business or by entering into a lease arrangement with a suitable property to develop cultivation facilities. 


7


We currently have no retail facilities within the state of California but continue to evaluate such opportunities and could seek to enter retail at a future date.

Also, we may consider, but do not currently have definitive plans or timelines for our expansion beyond California as these markets continue to expand.

Competitive Conditions

We compete with other branded licensed cultivators, manufacturers and distributors, offering similar products and services, within California.

Currently, the California cannabis industry is largely comprised of small to medium-sized entities. We believe that the vast majority of our competitors are relatively small operations. Over time, it is expected that within California the industry will begin to consolidate as market-share will increasingly favor larger and more sophisticated operators.

We expect to face additional competition from new entrants. To remain competitive, we expect to invest in scale, people, processes and technology to maintain cost and product leadership over our competitors.

We may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

Also, we expect to face continued competition from the illicit or “black-market” commercial activities that still operate within the state. Despite state-level legalization of cannabis in the United States, such operations remain abundant and present substantial competition to Lowell Farms. In particular, illicit operations, because they are largely clandestine, are not required to comply with the extensive regulations with which we must comply in order to conduct business, and accordingly may have significantly lower costs of operation. It is estimated that the current illicit cannabis market in California exceeds $8.5 billion.6

Intangible Property

To date, we have 12 registered federal trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, 6 California state trademark registrations and 2 Illinois state trademark registrations. In addition, we have 2 federal trademark applications pending and 2 pending Canadian applications. We own over 100 website domains, including www.lowellfarms.com, and numerous social media accounts across all major platforms. Lowell Farms maintains strict standards and operating procedures regarding its intellectual property, including the regular use of nondisclosure, confidentiality, and intellectual property assignment agreements.

Lowell Farms has developed numerous proprietary technologies and processes. These proprietary technologies and processes include its information system software, cultivation, edible manufacturing and extraction techniques, quality and compliance processes and new product development processes. While actively exploring the patentability of these techniques and processes, Lowell Farms relies on non-disclosure/confidentiality arrangements and trade secret protection. Lowell Farms has invested significant resources towards developing recognizable and unique brands consistent with premium companies in analogous industries.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") may deny federal trademark registration to any name, product, or other assets that violate the law, including cannabis products. However, hemp-derived goods and CBD products with less than 0.3% THC, as well as ancillary products or services, may be eligible for federal trademark registration. Additionally, the USPTO may accept trademark applications for consulting services or goods that do not directly involve the cannabis flower, such as computer software, educational platforms, and brand apparel. Cannabis products, goods, and services that do not meet the USPTO standard for trademark registration may qualify for state trademark registration in states where such products, goods, and services have been legalized.


8


No guarantee can be given that Lowell Farms will be able to successfully assert its trademark rights, nor can the Company guarantee that its trademark registrations will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any such invalidity, particularly with respect to a product name, or a successful intellectual property challenge or infringement proceeding against the company, could have a material adverse effect on Lowell Farms’ business.

Employees

Lowell Farms employs personnel with a wide range of skill sets, including those with masters’ and bachelors’ degrees in their respective fields. With respect to cultivation, Lowell Farms recruits individuals with plant science and agricultural experience, and personnel have the practical experience necessary to cultivate high yielding, multiple strain variety cannabis plants and to develop new cannabis strains through selective horticultural practices. With regard to extraction, Lowell Farms recruits individuals with extraction and distillation experience for its product lines, and personnel have the practical experience and knowledge necessary to process the raw, dried cannabis product through volatile and solventless extraction processes, thereby generating high yields of cannabis extracts and distillates. In addition, Lowell Farms personnel have the practical experience and knowledge necessary to conduct secondary processing of cannabis biomass into crude cannabis oil, distillate, and concentrates, including shatter, wax and crystals, and to utilize the natural terpenes in cannabis to formulate premium vaporizer oils. Terpenes are the oils that give cannabis plants their smell. They come from the same components as tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) and cannabidiol (“CBD”).

With regard to product development and manufacturing, Lowell Farms recruits individuals with professional culinary education for edibles product development for its edibles division, and personnel have extensive experience in confectionary product development and manufacturing, particularly with regard to cannabis edibles, including chocolates, candies, cookies, gummies, beverages and tinctures.

With regard to sales and distribution, we recruit employees who retain a high degree of industry awareness and knowledge who can interface with dispensaries state-wide and introduce our products with the intention of retaining and potentially increasing shelf-space and the intention of maintaining or increasing market share. Our sales and distribution teams are important conduits for collecting intelligence on consumer behavior and trends. Our distribution capabilities are critical to building trust with dispensaries that they will receive inventory on a timely and consistent basis.

Lowell Farms currently possesses all specialized skills and knowledge it requires, but will continue to compete with other cannabis and manufacturing companies to secure and retain such staff.

As of March 15, 2022, we had 201 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees, all of whom are located in California. Additionally, Lowell Farms utilizes contract employees in security, cultivation, packaging and warehousing activities. The use of contract employees enables Lowell Farms to manage variable staffing needs and in the case of cultivation and security personnel, access to experienced, qualified and readily available human resources.

In 2018, the manufacturing personnel of Lowell Farms were organized by UFCW Local 5. In 2020, prior to the completion of a collective bargaining agreement, the union workers voted to decertify UFCW Local 5. Under California law, the holder of a cannabis license with 20 or more employees must enter into a “labor peace agreement” with a union or provide a notarized statement to the Department of Cannabis Control that it will do so. A “labor peace agreement” is a private contract between an employer and a union that requires both parties to waive certain rights under federal labor law in connection with union organizing activities. Following the decertification of UFCW Local 5, Lowell Farms provided such a notarized statement to the Department of Cannabis Control. There has been no further union organizing activity of which the Company is aware involving its employees.

United States Regulatory Environment

Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where Lowell Farms is currently involved, directly or through its subsidiaries in the cannabis industry. Lowell Farms is directly engaged in the manufacture, extraction, cultivation, package, sale or distribution of cannabis in the adult-use and/or medical industries in the State of California. The Company derives all of its revenues from the cannabis industry in the State of California, which industry is illegal under U.S. federal law. The Company’s cannabis-related activities are compliant with applicable State and local law, and the related licensing framework, and the Company is not aware of any non-compliance with applicable State and local law, and the related licensing framework, by any of the Company’s clients to whom the Company renders services. Nonetheless, such activities remain illegal under U.S. federal law. The enforcement of relevant laws is a significant risk.

The Company evaluates, monitors and reassesses this disclosure, and any related risks, on an ongoing basis, and the same will be supplemented and amended to investors in public filings, including in the event of government policy changes or the introduction of new or amended guidance, laws or regulations regarding marijuana regulation. Any non-compliance, citations or notices of violation which may have an impact on the Company’s licenses, business activities or operations will be promptly disclosed by the Company.

United States Federal Overview 

The United States federal government regulates drugs in large part through the CSA. Marijuana, which is a form of cannabis, is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. As a Schedule I controlled substance, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse; no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. According to the U.S. federal government, cannabis having a concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, greater than 0.3% on a dry weight basis is marijuana. Cannabis with a THC content below 0.3% is classified as hemp. The scheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance is inconsistent with what we believe to be widely accepted medical uses for marijuana by physicians, researchers, patients, and others. Moreover, despite the clear conflict with U.S. federal law, currently the majority of states, as well as the territories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis in some form, and 18 states, as well as the District of Columbia, have legalized cannabis for adult or recreational use. As further evidence of the growing conflict between the U.S. federal treatment of cannabis and the societal acceptance of cannabis, the FDA on June 25, 2018 approved Epidiolex. Epidiolex is an oral solution with an active ingredient derived from the cannabis plant for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, in patients two years of age and older. This was the first FDA-approved drug that contains a purified substance derived from the cannabis plant. In this case, the substance is cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical component of marijuana that does not contain the psychoactive properties of THC.

Unlike in Canada, which uniformly regulates the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of marijuana at the federal level under the Cannabis Act (Canada), marijuana is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. State laws regulating marijuana are in conflict with the CSA, which makes marijuana use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal. Although our activities are compliant with the applicable state and local laws in California, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve us of liability under United States federal law nor provide a defense to any federal criminal action that may be brought against us.

In 2013, as more and more states began to legalize medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal law and these State-level regulatory frameworks. Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal agencies and banking institutions through a series of Department of Justice, or DOJ, memoranda. The most notable of this guidance came in the form of a memorandum issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013, which we refer to as the Cole Memorandum.


10


The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal agencies on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states and quickly set a standard for marijuana-related businesses to comply with. The Cole Memorandum put forth 8 prosecution priorities:


1. | Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gang and cartels; 
3. | Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
4. | Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
5. | Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 
6. | Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; 
7. | Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and
8. | Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property. 


On January 4, 2018, former United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys, which we refer to as the Sessions Memo. Rather than establishing national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under State law, the Sessions Memo simply rescinded the Cole Memorandum and instructed that “[in] deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the [DOJ’s] finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions.” Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles.

Neither Attorney General William Barr, who succeeded Attorney General Sessions, nor any subsequent Acting Attorney General provided a clear policy directive for the United States as it pertains to State-legal marijuana-related activities. Merrick Garland currently serves as Attorney General and it is not yet known whether the Department of Justice will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Mr. Garland indicated at a confirmation hearing before the United States Senate that it did not seem to him to be a good use of limited resources to pursue prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.

Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole Memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys.

As an industry best practice, despite the recent rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the Company abides by the following standard operating policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:


1. | ensure that its operations are compliant with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | ensure that its cannabis related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained (for example: in the states where cannabis is permitted only for adult-use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements); 
3. | implement policies and procedures to ensure that cannabis products are not distributed to minors; 
4. | implement policies and procedures to ensure that funds are not distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels; 
5. | implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to ensure that such compliance system is effective in tracking inventory and preventing diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or across any state lines in general;
6. | ensure that its state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs, is engaged in any other illegal activity or any activities that are contrary to any applicable anti-money laundering statutes; and 
7. | ensure that its products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.

In addition, the Company conducts background checks to ensure that the principals and management of its operating subsidiaries are of good character, have not been involved with other illegal drugs, engaged in illegal activity or activities involving violence, or use of firearms in cultivation, manufacturing or distribution of cannabis. The Company will also conduct ongoing reviews of the activities of its cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate and the policies and procedures that are related to possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of the licensed premises, including the cases where such possession is permitted by regulation. See “Risk Factors”.

Significantly, companies authorized to operate in states with medical marijuana laws and robust regulatory schemes enjoy additional protection under the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment (it is also sometimes referred to as the “Rohrabacher-Farr” or “Joyce-Leahy” Amendment) (the “Amendment”). The Amendment was first approved in 2014 and prevents the U.S. Department of Justice from using federal funds to prosecute state-compliant medical marijuana operators in states that have legal (medical) cannabis programs.  Moreover, the Amendment has been included in the federal budget approved by Congress since its introduction. It should be noted; however, that the Amendment must be renewed each fiscal year in order to remain in effect.

United States Border Entry

The United States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) enforces the laws of the United States as they pertain to lawful travel and trade into and out of the U.S. Crossing the border while in violation of the CSA and other related United States federal laws may result in denied admission, seizures, fines, and apprehension. CBP officers determine the admissibility of travelers who are non-U.S. citizens into the United States pursuant to the United States Immigration and Nationality Act. An investment in our Subordinate Voting Shares, if it became known to CBP, could have an impact on a non-U.S. citizen’s admissibility into the United States and could lead to a lifetime ban on admission.

Because marijuana remains illegal under United States federal law, those investing in Canadian companies with operations in the United States cannabis industry could face detention, denial of entry, or lifetime bans from the United States for their business associations with United States marijuana businesses. Entry happens at the sole discretion of CBP officers on duty, and these officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a non-US citizen or foreign national. The government of Canada has previously warned travelers that previous use of marijuana, or any substance prohibited by United States federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the United States. Business or financial involvement in the marijuana industry in the United States could also be reason enough for CBP to deny entry. On September 21, 2018, CBP released a statement outlining its current position with respect to enforcement of the laws of the United States. It stated that Canada’s legalization of cannabis will not change CBP enforcement of United States laws regarding controlled substances and because marijuana continues to be a controlled substance under United States law, working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal may affect admissibility to the United States. As a result, CBP has affirmed that, employees, directors, officers, managers and investors of companies involved in business activities related to marijuana in the United States (such as Lowell Farms), who are not United States citizens, face the risk of being barred from entry into the United States.

Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Access to Banking

The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States that involve anti-money laundering, financial recordkeeping and the proceeds of crime, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (referred to herein as the “Bank Secrecy Act”), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States.

Additionally, under United States federal law, it may potentially be a violation of federal anti-money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of any Schedule I controlled substance. Banks and other financial institutions could potentially be prosecuted and convicted of money laundering under the Bank Secrecy Act for providing services to cannabis businesses. Therefore, under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other financial service could be charged with money laundering or conspiracy.

While there has been no change in U.S. federal banking laws to accommodate businesses in the large and increasing number of U.S. states that have legalized medical or adult-use marijuana, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“FinCEN”), in 2014, issued guidance (the “FinCEN Guidance”) to prosecutors of money laundering and other financial crimes. The FinCEN Guidance advised prosecutors not to focus their enforcement efforts on banks and other financial institutions that serve marijuana-related businesses so long as that marijuana-related business activities are legal in their state and none of the federal enforcement priorities referenced in the Cole Memorandum are being violated (such as keeping marijuana out of the hands of organized crime). The FinCEN Guidance also clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations, including thorough customer due diligence, but makes it clear that they are doing so at their own risk. The customer due diligence steps typically include:


1. | Verifying with the appropriate State authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a State license to operate its marijuana-related business; 
3. | Requesting available information about the business and related parties from State licensing and enforcement authorities; 
4. | Developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus adult-use customers);
5. | Ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; 


13


6. | Ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in the FinCEN Guidance; and 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. | Refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk.


With respect to information regarding State licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where States make such information available.

While the FinCEN Guidance decreased some risk for banks and financial institutions considering servicing the cannabis industry, in practice it has not increased banks’ willingness to provide services to marijuana-related businesses. This is because current U.S. federal law does not guarantee banks immunity from prosecution, and it also requires banks and other financial institutions to undertake time-consuming and costly due diligence on each marijuana-related business they accept as a customer.

Those State-chartered banks and/or credit unions that have agreed to work with marijuana businesses are typically limiting those accounts to small percentages of their total deposits to avoid creating a liquidity risk. Since, theoretically, the federal government could change the banking laws as it relates to marijuana-related businesses at any time and without notice, these banks and credit unions must keep sufficient cash on hand to be able to return the full value of all deposits from marijuana-related businesses in a single day, while also keeping sufficient liquid capital on hand to service their other customers. Those State-chartered banks and credit unions that do have customers in the marijuana industry can charge marijuana businesses high fees to cover the added cost of ensuring compliance with the FinCEN Guidance.

As an industry best practice and consistent with its standard operating procedures, Lowell Farms adheres to all customer due diligence steps in the FinCEN Guidance and any additional requirements imposed by those financial institutions it utilizes. However, in the event that any of our operations, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues accruing from such operations in the United States were found to be in violation of anti-money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions could be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize our ability to declare or pay dividends or effect other distributions.

In the United States, the “SAFE Banking Act” has been put forth which would grant banks and other financial institutions immunity from federal criminal prosecution for servicing marijuana-related businesses if the underlying marijuana business follows State law. The SAFE Banking Act has been adopted by the House of Representatives multiple times since its initial introduction. Furthermore, the House of Representatives has passed other pieces of legislation key to marijuana reforms, such as the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act. The MORE Act would remove marijuana from the CSA and eliminate criminal penalties for individuals who manufacture, distribute or possess marijuana. While there is strong support in the public and within Congress for legislation such as the Safe Banking Act and the MORE Act, there can be no assurance that any such legislation will be adopted by both the House of Representatives and Senate. In both Canada and the United States, transactions involving banks and other financial institutions are both difficult and unpredictable under the current legal and regulatory landscape. Legislative changes could help to reduce or eliminate these challenges for companies in the cannabis space and would improve the efficiency of both significant and minor financial transactions.

Tax Concerns

An additional challenge for marijuana-related businesses is that the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 280E are being applied by the IRS to businesses operating in the medical and adult-use marijuana industry. Section 280E prohibits marijuana businesses from deducting their ordinary and necessary business expenses, forcing them to pay higher effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. The effective tax rate on a marijuana business depends on how large its ratio of non-deductible expenses is to its total revenues. Therefore, businesses in the legal cannabis industry may be less profitable than they would otherwise be. Furthermore, although the IRS issued a clarification allowing the deduction of cost of goods sold, the scope of such eligible cost items is interpreted very narrowly, and the bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs are not permitted to be capitalized as part of inventory cost basis and deducted as part of cost of goods sold, or otherwise deducted from gross profit, in determining taxable income.

The 2018 Farm Bill

CBD is a non-psychoactive chemical found in cannabis and is often derived from hemp, which contains, at most, only trace amounts of THC. On December 20, 2018, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (popularly known as the 2018 Farm Bill) was signed into law. Until the 2018 Farm Bill became law, hemp fell within the definition of “marijuana” under the CSA and the DEA classified hemp as a Schedule I controlled substance because hemp is part of the cannabis plant.

The 2018 Farm Bill defines hemp as the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of the plant with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% by dry weight and removes hemp from the CSA. The 2018 Farm Bill requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, to, among other things: (1) evaluate and approve regulatory plans approved by individual states for the cultivation and production of industrial hemp, and (2) promulgate regulations and guidelines to establish and administer a program for the cultivation and production of hemp in the U.S. The regulations promulgated by the USDA will be in lieu of those States not adopting State-specific hemp regulations. Hemp and products derived from it, such as CBD, may then be sold into commerce and transported across State lines provided that the hemp from which any product is derived was cultivated under a license issued by an authorized state program approved by the USDA and otherwise meets the definition of hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill also explicitly preserved the authority of the FDA to regulate hemp-derived products under the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Many have expected that the FDA will promulgate its own rules for the regulation of hemp-derived products. Notwithstanding the anticipated FDA rules, on October 29, 2019, the USDA published its proposed rules for the regulation of hemp, (referred to herein as the “USDA Rule”). The USDA Rule will go into effect immediately upon the conclusion of the public comment period and publication in the federal register by the USDA. The USDA Rule, among other things, sets minimum standards for the cultivation and production of hemp, as well as requirements for laboratory testing of hemp.

State Level Overview and Compliance Summary

In the United States, cannabis is largely regulated at the State level. Although California authorizes medical and adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed entities, and numerous other states have legalized marijuana in some form, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia remains illegal, and any such acts are criminal acts under U.S. federal law. Although we believe that our business activities are compliant with applicable State and local laws, strict compliance with State and local laws with respect to marijuana may neither absolve us of liability under U.S. federal law, nor provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against us. Any such proceedings brought against us may result in a material adverse effect on our business.
California Regulatory Landscape

In 1996, California was the first State to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This provided an affirmative defense for defendants charged with the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief. In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law, decriminalizing the use, possession, and collective cultivation of medical marijuana, and establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana patients.

In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the “Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act,” or MCRSA. The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. The system created testing laboratories and distributors. Edible infused product manufacturers would require either volatile solvent or non-volatile solvent manufacturing licenses depending on their specific extraction methodology. Multiple agencies would oversee different aspects of the program and businesses would require a State license and local approval to operate. However, in November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the “Adult Use of Marijuana Act,” or AUMA, creating an adult-use marijuana program for adult-use 21 years of age or older. In June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult-Use Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act, or MAUCRSA, which amalgamated MCRSA and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern the medical and adult-use licensing regime for marijuana businesses in the State of California. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018. In 2021, the three primary licensing agencies that regulated marijuana at the state level were the Bureau of Cannabis Control, or BCC, California Department of Food and Agriculture, or CDFA, and the California Department of Public Health, or CDPH.

On January 10, 2020, the three cannabis licensing agencies announced that California Governor Gavin Newsom’s budget proposal for cannabis industry regulation and taxation included plans to consolidate the three licensing entities into a single Department of Cannabis Control by July 2021. With the passage of AB 141 on July 12, 2021, the California Licensing Agencies were consolidated into the Department of Cannabis Control (“DCC”).  On September 8, 2021, the DCC announced proposed emergency regulations to move all cannabis regulations into Title 4 of the California Code of Regulations, with a stated goal of consolidating and improving the regulations. The proposed emergency regulations were in the review and comment period which closed on September 20, 2021.


15


One of the central features of MAUCRSA is known as “local control.” In order to legally operate a medical or adult-use marijuana business in California, an operator must have both a local and State license. This requires license-holders to operate in cities or counties with marijuana licensing programs. Cities and counties in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to marijuana operators, or, alternatively, can choose to ban marijuana licenses.

Licenses

Once an operator obtains local approval, the operator must obtain State licenses before conducting any commercial marijuana activity. There are multiple license categories that cover all commercial activity. Lowell Farms and its subsidiaries are licensed to operate Medical and Adult-Use Manufacturing, Nursery, Cultivation, Processing and Distribution facilities under applicable California and local jurisdictional law. Lowell Farms’ licenses permit it to possess, cultivate, process, manufacture and wholesale medical and adult-use cannabis and cannabis goods in the State of California pursuant to the terms of the various licenses issued by the Department of Cannabis Control. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at the Lowell Farms facilities in California.

The following licenses are held by the Company: 


Agency | License | City/County | Type of License 
-------+---------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------
CDFA | CCL18-0003496 | Monterey County | Nursery 
CDFA | CCL18-0003514 | Monterey County | Processor 
CDFA | CCL-21-0004259 – CCL-21-0004262 | Monterey County | Cultivation: Small Mixed-Light Tier 2 
CDFA | CCL 18-0001803 and 1804, CCL18-0003497 – CCL 18-0003503 | Monterey County | Cultivation: Small Mixed-Light Tier 2 
BCC | C11 0000816 LIC | City of Salinas | Distributor Provisional (Salinas) 
BCC | C11 0000685 | City of Los Angeles | Distributor Provisional (Los Angeles) 
CDPH | CDPH-10002196 | City of Salinas | Manufacturing Type 7: Volatile Extraction


The following license is held by 20800 Spence Road LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lowell SR LLC:


Agency | License | City/County | Type of License
-------+---------------+-----------------+----------------
CDFA | CCL20-0002424 | Monterey County | Processor 


California State and local licenses, including for the City of Los Angeles, are renewed annually. Each year, licensees are required to submit a renewal application per published guidelines. While renewals are annual, there is no limit on the number of permitted annual renewals. To renew a City of Los Angeles license with the Department of Cannabis Regulation, DCR, a renewal application and renewal fee are required to be paid by the licensee no earlier than 120 calendar days before the expiration of the license, and no later than 60 calendar days before the expiration of the license. At the time of a license renewal application, a licensee must include updated annual licensing documents. As part of the renewal process, the DCR may require modification to the licensee’s security plan. To renew a license, a licensee must be in good standing as required by the DCR and shall not be delinquent on any City tax or fee.


16


In respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Lowell Farms would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business. While Lowell Farms’ compliance controls have been developed to mitigate the risk of any material violations of a license arising, there is no assurance that Lowell Farms’ licenses will be renewed in the future in a timely manner. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the licensing renewal process could impede the ongoing or planned operations of Lowell Farms and have a material adverse effect on Lowell Farms’ business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

California License and Regulations

The Adult-Use and Medicinal Cultivation licenses that have been granted to Lowell Farms permit cannabis cultivation activity, which means any activity involving the planting, growing, harvesting, drying, curing, grading or trimming of cannabis. Such licenses further permit the production of a limited number of non-manufactured cannabis products and the sales of cannabis to certain licensed entities within the State of California for resale or manufacturing purposes.

Lowell Farms’ Adult-Use and Medicinal Manufacturing licenses permit Lowell Farms to extract concentrated cannabis, THC, CBD and other cannabis extracts from cannabis plants, then convert them to cannabis concentrates, edibles, balms, beverages, vapes and a variety of other consumer goods. Lowell Farms also packages and labels these goods, including processed flower (the smokable part of the cannabis plant) for wholesale delivery.

The Adult-Use and Medicinal Distribution licenses permit Lowell Farms to complete cannabis related distribution activity which means the procurement, sale, and transportation of cannabis and cannabis products between licensed entities. Distribution activity is permissible to and from certain Lowell Farms and non-Lowell Farms licensees.

In the State of California, only cannabis that is grown in California can be sold in the state. Although California is not a vertically integrated system, Lowell Farms is vertically integrated and has the capabilities to cultivate, harvest, manufacture and wholesale cannabis and cannabis products to licensed retail dispensaries. Under manufacturing, distribution and cultivation licenses, the State of California also allows Lowell Farms to make a wholesale purchase of cannabis from, or a distribution of cannabis and cannabis product to, another licensed entity within the state.

California – Local Licensure, Zoning and Land Use Requirements

To obtain a State license, cannabis operators must first obtain local authorization, which is a prerequisite to obtaining State licensure. California’s DCC requires confirmation from the applicable locality that an applicant is in compliance with local requirements and has either been granted authorization to, upon State licensure, continue previous cannabis activities or commence cannabis operations. One of the basic aspects of obtaining local authorization is compliance with all local zoning and land use requirements. Local governments are permitted to prohibit or otherwise regulate the types and number of cannabis businesses allowed in their locality. Some localities have limited the number of authorizations an entity may hold in total or for various types of cannabis activity. Others have tiered the authorization process, granting the initial rounds of local authorization to applicants that previously conducted cannabis activity pursuant to the CUA or those that meet the locality’s definition of social equity.
California – Record-Keeping and Continuous Reporting Requirements

California’s State license application process additionally requires comprehensive criminal history, regulatory history and personal disclosures for all beneficial owners. Any criminal convictions or civil penalties or judgments occurring after licensure must promptly be reported to the regulatory agency from which the licensee holds a license. State licenses must be renewed annually. Disclosure requirements for local authorization may vary, but generally tend to mirror the State’s requirements.

17


Licensees must also keep detailed records pertaining to various aspects of the business for up to 7 years. Such records must be easily accessible by the regulatory agency from which the licensee holds a license. Additionally, licensees must record all business transactions, which must be uploaded to METRC, the statewide traceability system. Lowell Farms is in compliance in all material respects with these record-keeping and disclosure requirements.

Storage and Security

To ensure the safety and security of cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products, Lowell Farms is required to do the following:

o | maintain fully operational security alarm systems; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | contract for state-certified security guard services; 
o | maintain video surveillance systems that records continuously 24 hours a day and maintains those recordings for at least 90 days; 
o | ensure that the facility’s outdoor premises have sufficient lighting; 
o | store cannabis and cannabis product only in areas per the premises diagram submitted to the State of California during the licensing process; 
o | store all cannabis and cannabis products in a secured, locked room or a vault; 
o | report to local law enforcement within 24 hours after being notified or becoming aware of the theft, diversion, or loss of cannabis; and 
o | ensure the safe transport of cannabis and cannabis products between licensed facilities, maintain a delivery manifest in any vehicle transporting cannabis and cannabis products. Only vehicles registered with the DCC, that meet DCC distribution requirements, are to be used to transport cannabis and cannabis products.

Marijuana Taxes in California

Several types of taxes are imposed in California for adult use sale. For 2020 and 2021, cultivators had the choice of being taxed at $9.65, per dry-weight ounce of cannabis flowers or $1.35 per ounce of wet-weight plants. Further, cultivators were required to pay $2.87 per ounce for cannabis leaves. Effective January 1, 2022, taxes increased to $10.08 per dry-weight ounce of cannabis flowers or $1.41 per ounce of wet-weight plants and cultivators are required to pay $3.00 per ounce for cannabis leaves, representing an increase of 3.2% - 4.5%. California also imposes an excise tax of 15%. Cities and counties apply their sales tax along with the state’s excise and many cities and counties have also authorized the imposition of special cannabis business taxes which can range from 2% to 10% of gross receipts of the business.

The Company has retained legal counsel and/or other advisors in connection with California’s marijuana regulatory program. The Company has developed standard operating procedures for licenses that are operational.

California – Operating Procedure Requirements

License applicants must submit standard operating procedures describing how the operator will, among other requirements, secure the facility, manage inventory, comply with the State’s seed-to-sale tracking requirements, dispense cannabis, and handle waste, as applicable to the license sought. Once the standard operating procedures are determined compliant and approved by the applicable State regulatory agency, the licensee is required to abide by the processes described and seek regulatory agency approval before any changes to such procedures may be made. Licensees are additionally required to train their employees on compliant operations and are only permitted to transact with other legal and licensed businesses.

18


Lowell Farms complies with these operational and training requirements by systematically training employees in various aspects of regulatory requirements, ensuring that operational and business practices are aligned with regulatory requirements, and by conducting internal audits to ensure compliance and identify areas for further training.

California – Site-Visits & Inspections

As a condition of State licensure, operators must consent to random and unannounced inspections of the commercial cannabis facility as well as the facility’s books and records to monitor and enforce compliance with State law. Many localities have also enacted similar standards for inspections, and the State of California has already commenced site-visits and compliance inspections for operators who have received State temporary or annual licensure.
California – Compliance Procedures

Lowell Farms utilizes MAX ERP, an integrated enterprise compliance platform, which integrates Lowell Farms’ inventory management program and standard operating procedures with the software’s compliance and quality features to facilitate compliance with State and local requirements. MAX ERP features include a compliance software solution that offers lot and batch control, recall management, document control and quality analysis. Additionally, Lowell Farms utilizes standard operating procedure building tools to facilitate the implementation and maintenance of compliant operations and tracks all required licensing maintenance criteria.
City of Los Angeles – Compliance Procedures

Following submission of a pre-application request and once compliance with the business premises location is completed, including all zoning requirements and sensitive use restrictions, the City of Los Angeles DCR will request and review attestations from primary personnel and owner(s) associated with the application. Following such review, the DCR will issue a determination of eligibility/ineligibility for further processing. A determination of eligibility is based on, among other things, an initial inspection and environmental clearance. Following a determination of eligibility, the DCR reviews the application for completeness, including the status of state licenses and verification of local compliance under way with the state agencies. Following temporary approval, applicants may apply for an annual license.

Continued compliance includes ongoing, unannounced inspections, investigations and audits conducted by the employees or agents of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health or the following City departments: the DCR, the Department of Building and Safety, the Department of City Planning, the Police Department, the Fire Department and the Office of Finance. Inspections may include an examination of employee practice; cannabis safety; proper storage; equipment/utensils; facility; plumbing fixtures; sign/license requirements; record keeping; compliance and enforcement; and requirements for manufacturing.

Lowell Farms has developed a robust compliance program designed to ensure operational and regulatory requirements continue to be satisfied, and has retained outside counsel to monitor its compliance with U.S. State and local law on an ongoing basis. Lowell Farms will continue to work closely with its legal counsel to develop and improve its internal compliance program and will defer to their legal opinions and risk mitigation guidance regarding California’s complex regulatory framework. The internal compliance program requires continued monitoring by managers and executives of Lowell Farms to ensure all operations conform to and comply with required laws, regulations and legally compliant standard operating procedures.
