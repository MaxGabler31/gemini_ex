ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 
Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” the “Company,” or “ARCA”) are in the business of recycling major household appliances in North America by providing turnkey appliance recycling and replacement services for utilities and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs through our subsidiaries ARCA Recycling, Inc. and ARCA Canada Inc.  In addition, through our GeoTraq Inc. (“GeoTraq”) subsidiary, a development stage company, we are engaged in the development, design and, ultimately, we expect the sale of, cellular transceiver modules, also known as Cell-ID modules. Prior to December 30, 2017, we sold new major household appliances in the United States though a chain of seventeen Company-owned retail stores operating under the name ApplianceSmart®. On December 30, 2017, we, together with our subsidiary ApplianceSmart, Inc. (“ApplianceSmart”), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with ApplianceSmart Holdings LLC (the “Purchaser”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Live Ventures Incorporated (“Live”), pursuant to which we sold to the Purchaser all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (the “ApplianceSmart Stock”) of ApplianceSmart in exchange for $6,500,000. Effective April 1, 2018, Purchaser issued the Company a promissory note with a three-year term in the original principal amount of $3,919,494 for the balance of the purchase price. ApplianceSmart is guaranteeing the repayment of this promissory note. In addition, we had a 50% interest in a joint venture, ARCA Advanced Processing, LLC (“AAP”), which recycles appliances in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, which we sold on August 15, 2017. See “Item 1 – Business - Recent Developments” for more information regarding the transactions involving GeoTraq, ApplianceSmart, and AAP.
 
As a leading recycler of major household appliances, we generate revenues from:
 

1. | Fees charged for collecting and recycling appliances for utilities and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Fees charged for recycling and replacing old appliances with new ENERGY STAR® appliances for energy efficiency programs sponsored by electric and gas utilities.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Sale of byproduct materials, such as metals, from appliances we recycle.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Sale of carbon offsets created by the destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants acquired through various recycling programs.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Through December 30, 2017, we generated revenues from the retail sales of appliances at our ApplianceSmart stores.
 
We were incorporated in Minnesota in 1983, although through our predecessors we began our appliance retail and recycling business in 1976. On March 12, 2018, we reincorporated into the State of Nevada. Our principal office is located at 175 Jackson Avenue North, Suite 102, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55343-4565.

Improper disposal of old appliances threatens air, ground and water resources because many types of major appliances contain substances that can damage the environment. These harmful materials include:
 

1. | Mercury, which easily enters the body through absorption, inhalation or ingestion, potentially causing neurological damage. Mercury-containing components may be found in freezers, washers and ranges.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Chlorofluorocarbon (“CFC”), hydrochlorofluorocarbon, and hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants (collectively, “Refrigerants”), which cause long-term damage to the earth’s ozone layer and may contribute to global climate change. Refrigerators, freezers, room air conditioners and dehumidifiers commonly contain Refrigerants. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | CFCs having a very high ozone-depletion potential that may also be used as blowing agents in the polyurethane foam insulation of refrigerators and freezers.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Other materials, such as oil, that are harmful when released into the environment.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The U.S. federal government requires the recovery of refrigerants upon appliance disposal and also regulates the management of hazardous materials found in appliances. Most state and local governments have also enacted laws affecting how their residents dispose of unwanted appliances. For example, many areas restrict landfills and scrap metal processors from accepting appliances unless the units have been processed to remove environmentally harmful materials.  As a result, old appliances usually cannot be discarded directly through ordinary solid waste systems.
 
In addition to these solid waste management and environmental issues, energy conservation is another compelling reason for proper disposal of old appliances. The U.S. Department of Energy’s updated appliance energy efficiency standards that took effect in September 2014 require new refrigerators to be 25 to 30 percent more efficient than those manufactured only one year earlier. Refrigerators manufactured today use about one-fifth as much electricity as units made in the mid-1970s.
 
While new refrigerators can save a significant amount of energy in the home, more than 20 percent of all U.S. households have a second refrigerator in the basement or garage. These units are typically 15-25 years old and consume about 750 to 1500 kilowatt-hours per year, driving electric bills up by more than $150 annually per household.
 
Utilities have become important participants in dealing with energy inefficient appliances as a way of reducing peak demand on their systems and avoiding the capital and environmental costs of adding new generating capacity. To encourage the permanent removal of energy inefficient appliances from use, many electric utility companies sponsor programs through which their residential customers can retire working refrigerators, freezers and room air conditioners.  Utility companies often provide assistance and incentives for consumers to discontinue use of a surplus appliance or to replace their old, inefficient appliances with newer, more efficient models. To help accomplish this, some utilities offer appliance replacement programs for some segments of their customers, through which older model kitchen and laundry appliances are recycled and new highly efficient ENERGY STAR® units are installed.
 
The EPA has been supportive of efforts by electric utilities and other entities that sponsor appliance recycling programs to ensure that the collected units are managed in an environmentally sound manner. In October 2006, the EPA launched the Responsible Appliance Disposal (“RAD”) Program, a voluntary partnership program designed to help protect the ozone layer and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Through the program, RAD partners use best practices to recover ozone-depleting chemicals and other harmful materials from old refrigerators, freezers, room air conditioners and dehumidifiers. In 2010, ApplianceSmart became the first independent retailer in the country to become a RAD partner. Because of our appliance recycling expertise, we were active participants in helping to design the RAD program and currently submit annual reports to the EPA to document the environmental benefits our utility customers that are RAD partners have achieved through their recycling programs.
 
Technology
 
GeoTraq is a development stage company in the business of acquiring new technologies for development and marketing. GeoTraq is a location-based service (“LBS”) technology provider planning to manufacture and sell cellular transceiver modules and associated services specifically enabled by Cell-ID. GeoTraq addresses the large LBS market segment that is currently under served with existing solutions due to high deployment costs (hardware, service, logistics), limited battery life and large form factor.
 
We believe that there is a large under-served portion of the LBS market that is not addressed by existing solutions. RFID and Wi-Fi require close proximity for asset tracking, while GPS is too bulky and power hungry for many needs. GeoTraq addresses the white space in-between by exclusively using Cell-ID technology. GeoTraq’s technology allows for a substantially lower cost solution, extended service life, a small form factor and even disposable devices, which we believe can significantly reduce return logistics costs.

Company Background
 
Recycling
 
We started our business in 1976 as a used appliance retailer that reconditioned old appliances to sell in our stores.  Under contracts with national and regional retailers of new appliances, such as Sears and Montgomery Ward, we collected the replaced appliance from the retailer's customer’s residence when one of their stores delivered a new appliance in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, Miami or Atlanta market. Any old appliances that we could not sell in our stores were sold to scrap metal processors. In the late 1980s, stricter environmental regulations began to affect the disposal of unwanted appliances, and we were no longer able to take appliances that contained hazardous components to a scrap metal processor. At that time, we began to develop systems and equipment to remove the harmful materials so that metal processors would accept the appliance shells for processing. We then offered our services for disposing of appliances in an environmentally sound manner to appliance manufacturers and retailers, waste hauling companies, rental property managers, local governments and the public.
  
In 1989, we began contracting with electric utility companies to provide turnkey appliance recycling services to support their energy conservation efforts. Since that time, we have provided our services to approximately 400 utilities and other providers of energy efficiency programs throughout North America.
 
We currently have contracts to recycle, or to replace and recycle, appliances for approximately 180 utilities across North America.
 
We have seen continued interest from sponsors of energy efficiency initiatives that recognize the effectiveness of recycling and replacing energy inefficient appliances.  We are aggressively pursuing electric, water and gas utilities, public housing authorities and energy efficiency management companies going forward and expect that we will continue to submit proposals for various new appliance recycling and replacement programs accordingly. However, for a variety of reasons, we still have a limited ability to project revenues from utility programs.  We cannot predict recycling volumes or if we will be successful in obtaining new contracts in 2018.
 
We operate thirteen recycling centers in the U.S. and Canada to process and recycle old appliances according to all federal, state, provincial and local rules and regulations. ARCA uses U.S. EPA RAD-compliant methods to remove and properly manage hazardous components and materials, including CFC refrigerants, mercury, polyurethane foam insulation and recyclable materials, such as ferrous and nonferrous metals, plastics and glass. All of our facilities comply with licensing and permitting requirements, and employees who process appliances receive extensive safety and hazardous materials training.
 
We entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with 4301 Operations, LLC, (“4301”) to establish and operate a regional processing center (“RPC”). 4301 has significant experience in the recycling of major household appliances and they contributed their existing business to the joint venture. Under the Joint Venture Agreement, the parties formed a new entity known as ARCA Advanced Processing, LLC (“AAP”) and each party has a 50% interest in AAP. We contributed $2.0 million to the joint venture and 4301 contributed their equipment and existing business to the joint venture. The joint venture commenced operations on February 8, 2010. We sold our interest in AAP on August 15, 2017. See “Item 1 – Business - Recent Developments.”
 
We purchased and installed a UNTHA Recycling Technology ("URT") materials recovery system, for which we are the exclusive North American distributor, to enhance the capabilities of the RPC in Philadelphia. We completed the installation of the URT materials recovery system in the third quarter of 2011. The URT materials recovery system recovers approximately 95 percent of the foam insulation from refrigerators; reduces typical landfill waste of the refrigerator by 83 percent by weight; lowers greenhouse gas and ozone-depleting substance emissions recovered from insulating foam compared with what typically happens in the industry today; and recovers high-quality plastics, aluminum, copper, steel and pelletized foam from refrigerators that can be used to make new products or for other beneficial use.
 
Geotraq
 
In a move to diversify our offering beyond our current appliance and other capabilities, on August 18, 2017, we acquired GeoTraq. GeoTraq is a development stage company in the business of acquiring new technologies for development and marketing. GeoTraq is a location-based service (“LBS”) technology provider planning to manufacture and sell cellular transceiver modules and associated services specifically enabled by Cell-ID. GeoTraq addresses the large LBS market segment that is currently under served with existing solutions due to high deployment costs (hardware, service, logistics), limited battery life and large form factor, We believe that there is a large under-served portion of the LBS market that is not addressed by existing solutions. RFID and Wi-Fi require close proximity for asset tracking, while GPS is too bulky and power hungry for many needs. GeoTraq addresses the white space in-between by exclusively using Cell-ID technology. GeoTraq’s technology allows for a substantially lower cost solution, extended service life, a small form factor and even disposable devices, which we believe can significantly reduce return logistics costs.
 
The GeoTraq acquisition allows us the ability to deploy Internet of Things devices to locate, monitor and track the movement of inventory and other assets.

ApplianceSmart
 
At December 30, 2017, ApplianceSmart operated seventeen stores: six in the Minneapolis/St. Paul market; one in Rochester, Minn.; one in St. Cloud, Minn.; three in the Columbus, Ohio market; four in the Atlanta, Georgia market; and two in the San Antonio, Texas market.  ApplianceSmart is a major household appliance retailer with two product categories: one consisting of typical and commonly available, innovative appliances, and the other consisting of affordable value-priced, niche offerings, such as close-outs, factory overruns, discontinued models and special-buy appliances, including out-of-carton merchandise and others.  One example of a special-buy appliance may be due to manufacturer product redesign, in which a current model is updated to include a few new features and is then assigned a new model number. Because the major manufacturers—primarily Whirlpool, General Electric and Electrolux—ship only the latest models to retailers, a large quantity of the previous models often remain in the manufacturers’ inventories. Special-buy appliances typically are not integrated into the manufacturers’ normal distribution channels and require a different method of management, which we provide.
 
For many years, manufacturers relied on small appliance dealers to buy these specialty products to sell in their stores.  However, many small retailers are struggling to compete with large appliance chains as the five largest retailers of major appliances account for nearly 75% of the sales volume.  At the same time, expansion of big-box retailers that sell appliances has created an increase in the number of special-buy units, further straining the traditional outlet system for these appliances. Because these special-buy appliances have value, manufacturers and retailers need an efficient management system to recover their worth.
 
See “Item 1 – Business - Recent Developments.”
 
Manufacturer Supply
 
We have entered into contracts or other arrangements for purchasing appliances that we sell in our ApplianceSmart stores or provide for utility appliance replacement programs.  These contracts and arrangements are with the following six major manufacturers:
1.       Electrolux
 
2.       GE Appliances
 
3.       LG
 
4.       Samsung
 
5.       Whirlpool
 
6. AGA/Marvel
 
There are no guarantees on the number of units any of the manufacturers will sell us. However, we believe purchases from these six manufacturers will provide an adequate supply of high-quality appliances for our ApplianceSmart stores and our appliance replacement programs.
Subsidiaries
 
GeoTraq Inc., a Nevada corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary that was initially incorporated in Nevada on October 20, 2016. GeoTraq is a development stage company engaged in the development, design and, ultimately, we expect the sale of, cellular transceiver modules, also known as Cell-ID modules. We acquired GeoTraq on August 18, 2017. See “Item 1 – Business - Recent Developments.”

On August 15, 2017 Recleim PA, LLC paid in full all BB&T indebtedness owed by AAP in the amount of $3,454,000 and terminated and released all security interests in AAP and ARCA’s equipment as part of Recleim PA LLC’s purchase of certain equipment and assets from AAP on the same date. Recleim PA LLC is also assuming approximately $768,000 in AAP liabilities and assuming all of ARCA’s liabilities to Haier US Appliance Solutions, Inc, dba GE Appliances (“GEA”).
 
Customers and Source of Supply
 
We also provide services for electric utility companies and other sponsors of energy efficiency initiatives that offer their customers appliance recycling and replacement programs as energy conservation measures. ApplianceSmart offers reverse logistics services to manufacturers and retailers needing an efficient way to manage appliances that fall outside their normal distribution and sales channels.
 
Utility Companies: We contract with utility companies or their program administrators and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs to provide a full range of appliance recycling and replacement services to help them achieve their energy savings goals. The contracts usually have terms of one to three years, with provisions for renewal at the option of the utility. Under some contracts, we manage all aspects, including advertising of the appliance recycling or replacement program. Under other contracts, we provide only specified services, such as collection and recycling.
 
Our contracts with utility customers prohibit us from repairing and selling appliances or appliance parts we receive through their programs. Because the intent of these programs is to conserve electricity, we have instituted tracking and auditing procedures to assure our customers that those appliances do not return to use.

Our pricing for energy efficiency program contracts is generally on a per-appliance basis and depends upon several factors, including:
 
1.       Total number of appliances expected to be processed and/or replaced.
 
2.       Length of the contract term.
 
3.       Specific services the utility requires us to provide.
 
4.       Market factors, including labor rates and transportation costs.
 
5.       Anticipated revenue associated with the sale of recycled appliance byproducts.
 
6.        Competitive bidding scenarios.
 
GeoTraq: GeoTraq is a development stage company and currently has no customers. GeoTraq sources its raw materials, including electronic chips, computers and software from various third parties. GeoTraq is not dependent on any single supplier for its modules.
 
Appliance Manufacturers: We work with appliance manufacturers, including Electrolux, GE Appliances, LG, Samsung and Whirlpool, to acquire the appliances we sell in our ApplianceSmart stores. We purchase new, special-buy appliances, such as discontinued models, out-of-carton units and factory overruns, and sell them at a significant discount to full retail prices. In addition, our participation in a national buying cooperative enables us to purchase the latest models of new appliances to fill out our product mix. Although we believe our current sources for appliances are adequate to supply our retail stores and allow us to grow our sales, we face the risk that one or more of these sources could be lost.
Company Operations
 
In our recycling operations, our Company-trained technicians first inspect and categorize each appliance to identify the types of hazardous materials, if any, it contains. We then process the appliances to remove and manage the environmentally hazardous substances according to federal, state and local regulations. Plastics and other recyclable components are managed by materials recyclers, and we deliver the processed appliance shells to local scrap processing facilities, where they shred and recycle the metals. We are aggressively pursuing additional utility customers but have a limited ability to project revenues from new utility programs in 2018 and thereafter. We cannot predict recycling or replacement volumes. However, we were successful in obtaining new contracts in 2017 with new and former customers across the country.
 
Many of the appliances we receive from manufacturers are still in the factory carton and ready to sell. Other appliances need repair or cosmetic work before we deliver them to our ApplianceSmart stores. All appliances we sell are new, under factory warranty and covered by a 100% money-back guarantee. We also offer extended warranties, appliance delivery, factory-trained technician service and recycling of customers replaced appliances.
 
Appliances that do not meet our quality standards for sale at our ApplianceSmart stores and appliances collected through utility customers’ energy conservation programs are recycled to prevent re-use. We process and recycle these units using environmentally sound systems and techniques.
 
GeoTraq is a development stage company in the business of acquiring new technologies for development and marketing. GeoTraq is continuing to develop its technology and has recently entered into pilot test agreements with various third parties.
 
ApplianceSmart provided a full range of appliance recycling support services for energy efficiency programs in North America. We also purchase major appliances, primarily from appliance manufacturers, to sell through our ApplianceSmart stores.
 
Principal Products and Services
 
At December 30, 2017, we generated revenues from three sources: retail, recycling and byproduct, including carbon offsets. Recycling revenues were generated by charging fees for collecting and recycling appliances for utilities and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs and through the sale of new ENERGY STAR® appliances to utility companies for installation in the homes of a specific segment of their customers. Byproduct revenues were generated by selling scrap materials, such as metal and plastics, from appliances we collected and recycled, including those from our ApplianceSmart stores and those processed at AAP. Carbon offset revenues were created by the destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants acquired through various recycling programs from our ApplianceSmart stores and through processing of refrigerators and freezers at AAP. Retail revenues were generated through the sale of appliances at our ApplianceSmart stores. Our technology segment is comprised of a development stage company and did not generate any revenues in 2017.

During fiscal year 2017, we operated three reportable segments: retail, recycling and technology (commencing on August 18, 2017). During fiscal year 2016, we operated two reportable segments: retail and recycling. The retail segment is comprised of sales generated through our ApplianceSmart stores. Our recycling segment includes all fees charged for collecting, recycling and installing appliances for utilities and other customers and includes byproduct revenue, which is generated primarily through the recycling of appliances. Our technology segment is comprised of a development stage company, we are engaged in the development, design and, ultimately, we expect the sale of, cellular transceiver modules, also known as Cell-ID modules. In 2017, through August 15, 2017 and 2016, we consolidated AAP in our financial statements. Sales generated by AAP are included in byproduct revenues in our recycling segment. Financial information about our segments is included in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 6 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We use a variety of methods to promote awareness of our products and services. We believe that we are recognized as a leader in the appliance recycling and replacement industry and, prior to our sale of ApplianceSmart, in special-buy appliance retailing.
 
We market our appliance recycling and replacement services to utility companies and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs by contacting prospective end user customers directly, delivering educational presentations at conferences for energy efficiency professionals, participating in utility industry trade shows, networking with key affiliates of electric power and environmental associations, and promoting on our corporate website at www.ARCAInc.com.  We submit sales proposals for our services to interested parties and in response to requests for bid.
 
GeoTraq is a development stage company in the business of acquiring new technologies for development and marketing and had no sales during 2017.
 
Our ApplianceSmart concept included establishing large showrooms in metropolitan locations where we offer consumers a selection of hundreds of appliances at each of our stores. Our visual branding consists of ample display of product, manufacturers’ signage and custom-designed ApplianceSmart materials. We advertise our stores through television, radio, print media, social media and direct mail. Through www.ApplianceSmart.com, consumers can also search our inventory and purchase appliances online.
 
Seasonality
 
Promotional activities for programs in which the utility sponsor conducts all advertising are generally strong during the second and third calendar quarters, leading to higher customer demand for services during that time period.  As a result, we experience a surge in business during the second and third calendar quarters, which generally declines through the fourth and first calendar quarters until advertising activities resume.
 
GeoTraq currently has no customers and therefore does not currently experience seasonality.
 
Prior to our sale of ApplianceSmart, we experienced some seasonality in retail revenues, with revenues in the second and third calendar quarters being slightly higher than revenues in the first and fourth calendar quarters.
 
Competition
 
Many factors, including obtaining adequate resources to create and support the infrastructure required to operate large-scale appliance recycling and replacement programs, affect competition in the industry. We generally compete for contracts with several other appliance recycling businesses, energy services management companies and new-appliance retailers. We also compete with small hauling or recycling companies based in the program’s service territory. Many of these companies, including used-appliance dealers that call themselves “appliance recyclers,” resell in the secondary market a percentage of the used appliances they accept for recycling. The unsalable units may not be properly processed to remove environmentally harmful materials because these companies do not have the capability to offer the full range of services we provide.

7
-

 

We expect our primary competition for appliance recycling and replacement contracts with existing and new customers to come from a variety of sources, including:
 
1.       Existing recycling companies.
 2.       Entrepreneurs entering the appliance recycling business.
 3.       Management consultants.
 4.       Major waste hauling companies.
 5.       Scrap metal processors.
 6.       National and regional new appliance retailers.
 
In addition, utility companies and other customers may choose to provide all or some of the services required to operate their appliance recycling and replacement programs internally rather than contracting with outside vendors. We have no assurance that we will be able to compete profitably in any of our chosen markets.
 
The industry in which GeoTraq plans on operating is extremely competitive and constantly changing. Within the location-based services industry, there are a significant number of companies that are competing for customers, recurring fees, administrative fees and many other unique opportunities for revenue. GeoTraq’s principal competitors are GPS and RFID companies.
 
Prior to our sale of ApplianceSmart, our retail competition comes mainly from new-appliance and other special-buy retailers. Each ApplianceSmart store competes with local and national retail appliance chains, as well as with independently owned retailers. Many of these retailers have been in business longer than us and may have significantly greater assets.
 
Government Regulation
 
Federal, state and local governments regulate appliance collection, recycling and sales activities. While some requirements apply nationwide, others vary by market. The many laws and regulations that affect appliance recycling include landfill disposal restrictions, hazardous waste management requirements and air quality standards. For example, the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act prohibit the venting of all Refrigerants while servicing or disposing of appliances.
 
Each of our recycling facilities maintains the appropriate registrations, permits and licenses for operating at its location. We register our recycling centers as hazardous waste generators with the EPA and obtain all appropriate regional and local licenses for managing hazardous wastes. Licensed hazardous waste companies transport and recycle or dispose of the hazardous materials we generate. Our collection vehicles and our transportation employees are required to comply with all U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) licensing requirements.
 
We have been recognized for our work in protecting the environment from the harmful effects of improper appliance disposal. In 2004, the EPA awarded us, along with our former customer Southern California Edison Company (“SCE”), the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award for the environmentally responsible manner in which we collect and dispose of appliances. In 2007, we were again recognized by the EPA with a Best of the Best Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award as part of an appliance recycling team responsible for “the most exceptional global contributions in the first two decades of the Montreal Protocol.” We were recognized by SCE as the sole recipient of the 2010 Environmental Excellence Award for our “exemplary support and service of SCE’s Appliance Recycling Program” and commitment to providing “the highest levels of performance and service to SCE and program participants while maintaining the strong values and ethics that exemplify a value-added supplier.” ARCA has provided services for SCE since 1994.
 
In 2009, our then President and Chief Executive Officer, Edward R. (Jack) Cameron, was selected to represent the appliance recycling industry in the Climate Action Reserve’s 23-member workgroup that was tasked with developing the U.S. Ozone-Depleting Substances Project Protocol for the Destruction of Domestic High Global Warming Potential Ozone-Depleting Substances. The Climate Action Reserve is a national offsets program working to ensure integrity, transparency and financial value in the U.S. carbon market. The protocol was issued on February 3, 2010, and provides guidance to account for, report and verify greenhouse gas emission reductions associated with destruction of high global warming potential ozone-depleting substances that would have otherwise been released to the atmosphere, including those used in both foam and refrigerant applications.
 
In January 2013, through the authority of the California Air Resources Board, California launched a greenhouse gas (“GHG”) cap-and-trade program that will encompass 85% of the state’s emissions and affect all businesses operating in California by 2020; in 2017, the state legislature extended the program through 2030. The first compliance period enforcing the GHG emissions limits for capped business sectors began January 1, 2013. Entities may meet up to eight percent of their compliance obligations with freely sold or traded offset credits, such as those created through the voluntary destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants. We have been an active participant in California’s developing carbon offset market and anticipate increased involvement as the program expands.
 
Our retail stores obtain business licenses, sales tax licenses and permits required for their locations. Our distribution and service vehicles comply with all DOT licensing requirements. In addition, in 2010, ApplianceSmart became the first independent retailer in the country to partner with the EPA in the Responsible Appliance Disposal (“RAD”) Program. Through RAD, partners commit to employing best environmental practices to reduce emissions of ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases through the proper disposal of refrigeration appliances at end of life. RAD partners report program results to the EPA annually to help quantify climate protection efforts.

Although we believe that further governmental regulation of the appliance recycling industry could have a positive effect on us, we cannot predict the direction of future legislation. Under some circumstances, for example, further regulation could materially increase our operational costs or reduce environmental requirements for disposing of appliances at end of life. In addition, under some circumstances we may be subject to contingent liabilities because we handle hazardous materials. We believe we are in compliance with all government regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials, and we have environmental insurance to mitigate the impact of any potential contingent liability.
