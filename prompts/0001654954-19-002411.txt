 AutoWeb, Inc. was incorporated on May 17, 1996, under the laws of the State of Delaware. Unless specified otherwise, as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “AutoWeb” refer to AutoWeb, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 Available Information
  
 Our corporate website is located at www.autoweb.com. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. At or through the Investor Relations section of our website we make available our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Overview
  
 We are a digital marketing company for the automotive industry that assists automotive retail dealers (“Dealers”) and automotive manufacturers (“Manufacturers”) market and sell new and used vehicles to consumers through our programs for online lead and traffic referrals, Dealer marketing products and services, online advertising and mobile products.
 
 Our consumer-facing automotive websites (“Company Websites”) provide consumers with information and tools to aid them with their automotive purchase decisions and the ability to submit inquiries requesting Dealers to contact the consumers regarding purchasing or leasing vehicles (“Leads”). Leads are internally-generated from our Company Websites (“Internally-Generated Leads”) or acquired from third parties (“Non-Internally-Generated Leads”) that generate Leads from their websites (“Non-Company Websites”). Our click traffic referral program provides consumers who are shopping for vehicles online with targeted offers based on make, model and geographic location. As these consumers conduct online research on our Company Websites or on the site of one of our network of automotive publishers, they are presented with relevant offers on a timely basis and, upon the consumer clicking on the displayed advertisement, are sent to the appropriate website location of one of our Dealer, Manufacturer or advertising customers.

  Products and Services
  
 We sell Internally-Generated Leads and Non-Internally-Generated Leads directly to Dealers and indirectly to Dealers through a wholesale market consisting of Manufacturers and other third parties in the automotive Lead distribution industry.  The click traffic program links consumers to Dealers and Manufacturer websites when the consumers click on advertisements on Company Websites as well as websites operated by third parties that have contracted with the Company as publishers under the click traffic program. In addition to our Leads and click traffic programs, we also offer Dealers and Manufacturers other products and services, including WebLeads+ and Payment Pro®, to assist them in capturing online, in-market customers and selling more vehicles by improving conversion of Leads to sale transactions.
 Lead Programs
  
 We provide Dealers and Manufacturers with opportunities to market their vehicles efficiently to potential vehicle buyers.  Dealers participate in our Lead programs, and Manufacturers participate in our Lead programs, our display advertising programs and our direct marketing programs, reaching consumers who are in the market to acquire a vehicle.  For consumers, we provide, at no cost to the consumer, an easy way to obtain valuable information to assist them in their vehicle shopping process. Leads may be submitted by consumers through our Company Websites or through Non-Company Websites. For consumers using our Company Websites, we provide research information, including vehicle specification data, safety data, pricing data, photos, videos, regional rebate and incentive data, and additional tools, such as the compare and configuration tools, to assist them in this process.  We also provide additional content on our Company Websites, including our database of articles, such as consumer and professional reviews, and other analyses.  Additional automotive information is also available on our Company Websites to assist consumers with specific vehicle research, such as the trade-in value of their current vehicle.
   
  New Vehicle Leads Program. Our Leads program for new vehicles allows consumers to submit requests for pricing and availability of specific makes and models.  A new vehicle Lead provides a Dealer with information regarding the make and model of a vehicle in which the consumer is interested, and may also include additional data regarding the consumer’s needs, including any vehicle trade-in, whether the consumer wishes to lease or buy, and other options that are important to the vehicle acquisition decision. A Lead will usually also include the consumer’s name, phone number and email address and may include a postal address.
  
 Dealers participating in our new vehicle Leads program are provided with iControl by AutoWeb, our proprietary technology that allows Dealers many options to filter and control the volume and source of their Leads. iControl by AutoWeb can be controlled at the dealership (or by a representative of AutoWeb on behalf of the dealership), at the Dealer group level from a web-based, easy-to-use console that makes it quick and simple for dealerships to change their Lead acquisition strategy to adjust for inventory conditions at their dealerships and broader industry patterns (such as changes in gas prices or changes in consumer demand). From the console, dealerships can easily contract or expand territories and increase, restrict or block specific models and Lead web sources, making it much easier to target inventory challenges and focus marketing resources more efficiently.
  
 Our Leads are subject to quality verification that is designed to maintain the high-quality of our Leads and increase the Lead buy rates for our Lead customers. Quality verification includes the validation of name, phone number, email address and postal address. Our quality verification also involves proprietary systems as well as arrangements with third-party vendors specializing in customer validation. After a Lead has been subjected to quality verification, if we have placement coverage for the Lead within our own Dealer network, we send the Lead to Dealers that sell the type of vehicle requested in the consumer’s geographic area. We also send an email message to the consumer with the Dealer’s name and phone number, and if the Dealer has a dedicated internet manager, the name of that manager. Dealers contact the consumer with a price quote and availability information for the requested vehicle. In addition to sales of Leads directly to Dealers in our network, we also sell Leads wholesale to Manufacturers for delivery to their Dealers and to third parties that have placement coverage for the Lead with their own customers.
  
 Dealers participate in our retail new vehicle Lead program by entering into contracts directly with us or through major Dealer groups. Generally, our Dealer contracts may be terminated by either party on 30 days’ notice and are non-exclusive. The majority of our retail new vehicle Lead revenues consists of either a monthly subscription or a per-Lead fee paid by Dealers in our network. We reserve the right to adjust our fees to Dealers upon 30 days’ prior notice at any time during the term of the contract. Manufacturers (directly or through their marketing agencies) and other third parties participate in our wholesale new vehicle Lead programs generally by entering into agreements where either party has the right to terminate upon prior notice, with the length of time for the notice varying by contract. Revenues from retail new vehicle Leads accounted for 18%, 19% and 22% of total revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenues from wholesale Leads accounted for 52%, 46% and 46% of total revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
  
  Used Vehicle Leads Program. Our used vehicle Lead program allows consumers to search for used vehicles according to specific search parameters, such as the price, make, model, mileage, year and location of the vehicle. The consumer is able to locate and display the description, price and, if available, digital images of vehicles that satisfy the consumer’s search parameters.  The consumer can then submit a Lead for additional information regarding a vehicle that we then deliver to the Dealer offering the vehicle. In addition to sending Leads directly to Dealers through our Lead delivery system, consumers may choose to contact the Dealer using a toll free number posted next to the vehicle search results. We charge each Dealer that participates in the used Vehicle Leads program a monthly subscription or per Lead fee.  Revenues from used vehicle Leads accounted for 7%, 9% and 10% of total revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

  Other Dealer Products and Services
  
 In addition to Leads and AutoWeb traffic programs, we also offer products and services that assist Dealers in connecting with in-market consumers and closing vehicle sales.
  
  WebLeads+. Designed to work in connection with a Dealer’s participation in our Lead programs, WebLeads+ is a third-party product that offers a Dealer multiple coupon options that display relevant marketing messages to consumers visiting the Dealer’s website.  When a Dealer uses WebLeads+, consumers visiting the Dealer’s website are encouraged to take action in two ways.  First, while interacting with the Dealer website, a consumer is presented with a customized special offer formatted for easy Lead submission. If a vehicle quote is requested, the Lead goes directly into the dealership management tool so a salesperson can promptly address the customer’s questions.  Second, if the consumer leaves the Dealer’s website but remains online, the WebLeads+ product keeps the coupon active in a new browser, providing the Dealer a repeat branding opportunity and giving the consumer an easy way to re-engage with the Dealer’s website through submission of a Lead.  The additional Leads generated by the coupons are seamlessly integrated into our Extranet tool.

  Payment Pro®.  Payment Pro® is a Dealer website conversion tool based on a third-party product that offers consumers real-time online monthly payment information based on an instant evaluation process.  The payments are based on the consumer’s credit, the actual vehicle being researched and the Dealer finance rates without requiring the consumer to provide personal information, such as date of birth or social security number. The Lead goes directly into the Dealer’s management tool so that a salesperson can promptly address the consumer’s inquiry.
  
  Advertising Programs
  
 Our Company Websites attract an audience of prospective automotive buyers that advertisers can target through display advertising. A primary way advertisers use our Company Websites to reach consumers is through vehicle content targeting. This allows automotive marketers to reach consumers while they are researching one of our automotive segments such as mini-vans or SUVs and offer Manufacturers sponsorship opportunities to assist in their efforts both in terms of customer retention and conquest strategies. Our Company Websites also offer Manufacturers the opportunity to feature their makes and models within highly contextual content. Through their advertising placements, Manufacturers can direct consumers to their respective websites for further information. We believe this transfer of focused, interested consumers to Manufacturer sites is the most significant action measured by Manufacturers in evaluating our performance and value for the Manufacturer’s marketing programs. Through our agreement with a third party, the third party sells our fixed placement advertising across our Company Websites to automotive advertisers. We also offer a direct marketing platform that enables Manufacturers to selectively target in-market consumers during the often-extended vehicle shopping process. Designed to keep a specific automotive brand in consideration, our direct marketing programs allow automotive marketers to deliver specific communication through either email or direct mail formats to in-market consumers during their purchase cycle.
  
  Our click traffic program is our pay-per-click advertising program. The click traffic program utilizes proprietary technology to offer consumers who are shopping targeted offers based on make, model and geographic location. As these consumers are conducting research on one of AutoWeb’s consumer facing websites or on the site of one of our network of automotive publishers, they are presented with relevant offers on a timely basis and, upon the consumer clicking on the displayed advertisement, are sent to the appropriate website location of one of our Dealer, Manufacturer or advertising customers. The AutoWeb network of publisher websites reaches and engages with millions of potential car buyers each month, and we believe it provides high-intent, high-quality traffic that Dealers and other customers cannot typically reach through their own marketing efforts. The click traffic program is flexible and in addition to driving traffic to a vehicle detail page, it can also send website traffic to new vehicle sales, service, used vehicles or to any other department where a customer wants to engage with in-market consumers. In addition, we believe that the click traffic program can be used to conquest competitive shoppers who are researching another brand more effectively than can typically be done using other search engines. Advertisers only pay for the clicks they receive, and are able to structure campaigns with flexible budgets and no long-term commitments in order to manage spend versus key performance indicators. Ongoing feedback from our customers is that this traffic provides highly targeted marketing opportunities and is a valuable tool to help Dealers sell more vehicles.
  
 Advertising revenues, including direct marketing, accounted for 22%, 24% and 16% of total revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
  
  Strategy
  
 Our goal is to garner a larger share of the billions of dollars spent annually by Dealers and Manufacturers on automotive marketing services.  We plan to achieve this objective through the following principal strategies:
  
   
6




 
  Increasing The Supply of High-Quality Leads. High-quality Leads are those Leads that result in high transaction (i.e., vehicle acquisition) closing rates for our Dealer customers.  Internally-Generated Leads are generally higher quality than Non-Internally-Generated Leads and increase the overall quality of our Lead portfolio. Non-Internally-Generated Leads are of varying quality depending on the source of these Leads. We plan to increase the supply of high-quality Leads generated to sell to our customers primarily by:
  
   ●
Increasing traffic acquisition activities for our Company Websites. Traffic to our Company Websites is monetized primarily though the creation of Leads that are delivered to our Dealer or Manufacturer customers to help them market and sell new and used vehicles, and through the sale of advertising space on our Company Websites. We plan to increase the traffic to our Company Websites through effective search engine optimization (“SEO”) and search engine marketing (“SEM”) traffic acquisition activities and enhancements to our Company Websites. SEO is the practice of optimizing keywords in website content to drive traffic to a website through natural search, and SEM is the practice of bidding on keywords on search engines to drive traffic to a website

 
 o SEO and SEM traffic acquisition activities. Traffic to our Company Websites is obtained through a variety of sources and methods, including direct navigation to our Company Websites, SEO, SEM, direct marketing and partnering with other website publishers that provide links to our websites.  Our goal is that over time, paid traffic such as SEM will be balanced by greater visitation from direct navigation and SEO, which we expect to result in increased Lead volumes and gross profit margins.
  
 o Continuing to enhance the quality and user experience of our Company Websites.  We continuously make enhancements to our Company Websites, including enhancements of the design and functionality of our Company Websites.  These enhancements are intended to position our Company Websites as comprehensive best in class destinations for automotive purchase research by consumers. By doing so, we believe we will increase the volume of our Internally-Generated Leads.
  
   ●
 Increasing the conversion rate of visitors to Leads on our Company Websites.  Through increased SEO and SEM activities and significant content, tools and user interface enhancements to our websites, we believe we will be able to increase the number of website visits and improve website “engagement,” and thereby increase the conversion of page views into Leads.  We believe that an increased conversion rate of page views into Leads could result in higher revenue per visitor.

 
   ●
Relationships    with Suppliers of High-Quality, Non-Internally-Generated Leads. We plan to continue to develop and maintain strong relationships with suppliers of Non-Internally-Generated Leads that consistently provide high-quality Leads.

 
  Increasing Leads Sales to our Customers. Our principal source of revenue comes from sales of Leads to our retail and wholesale Lead customers. Our goal is to increase sales of Leads to our customers primarily by:
  
   ●
  Increasing Lead Sales to Dealers. Sales of Leads to our Dealer network constitute a significant source of our revenues.  During 2018, we continued to focus our Dealer acquisition and retention strategies on dealerships to which we could deliver a higher percentage of our Internally-Generated Leads.  We believe this will result in increased vehicle sales for our Dealers and ultimately stronger relationships with us because, based on our evaluation of the performance data and information discussed above, we believe our Internally-Generated Leads are of high-quality. Our goal is to increase the number of Leads sold to our retail Dealer customers by:

 
   o
 increasing the quality of the Leads sold to our Dealers,

   o
 increasing the number of Dealers in our Dealer network,

   o
 reducing Dealer churn in our Dealer network,

   o
 providing customizable Lead programs to meet our Dealers’ unique marketing requirements,

   o
 providing additional value added marketing services that help Dealers more effectively utilize the internet to market and sell new and used vehicles,

   o
 increasing overall Dealer satisfaction by improving all aspects of our services,

   o
 increasing the size of our retail Dealer footprint,

   o
 focusing on higher revenue Dealers that are more cost-effective to support, and 

   o
 enhancing our internal Lead generation activities by leveraging our expanded retail lead coverage.

 
   ●
 Increasing Lead Sales to Wholesale Customers.  We currently have agreements to sell Leads to most Manufacturer Lead programs.  We intend to continue to demonstrate the value of third-party leads to Manufacturers by utilizing close rate and cross sell data that demonstrates that third party leads result in incremental sales for the Manufacturers.  Our intention is to increase revenue by having Manufacturers enhance business rules, program capacity, pricing and coverage so that each Manufacturer can purchase more of our Internally-Generated Leads.

  Continuing to develop the click traffic program for online automotive advertisers and publishers.  Our click traffic program uses proprietary technology and a pay-per-click business model to analyze web traffic and adjust advertiser costs accordingly based on traffic quality.  This traffic network is targeted to attract high-intent, high-volume publishers and is intended to allow them to monetize traffic that has previously been under-monetized.  In-market car shoppers are presented with highly relevant display advertisements and benefit from an online experience that delivers information that consumers use in making their car buying decisions.  Manufacturers benefit from this high-quality traffic from serious in-market car buyers.  Our click traffic program enables Manufacturers and Dealers to optimize their advertising by driving traffic to appropriate areas of their Tier 1 (Manufacturer national advertising), Tier 2 (Manufacturer and advertising associations regional advertising) and Tier 3 (Dealer) websites.  
  
 We believe that Manufacturers and Dealers will see the measurable attribution from this click traffic and will reallocate marketing spend from traditional channels into this emerging medium. We also plan to grow the size of this addressable marketplace by adding high-quality and high-volume automotive publishers to our network, by targeting in-market consumers on a variety of social media platforms and by continuing to optimize this advertising platform on our consumer facing websites. In addition, we believe that the flexibility of our solution combined with high-quality traffic with automotive purchase intent may allow us to grow our click advertiser base as the level of attribution from this product is understood by advertising partners.
  
  Increasing Display Advertising Revenues.  As traffic to, and time spent on, our Company Websites by consumers increases, we will seek to increase our advertising revenues.  Through our agreement with a third party, we benefit from the third party’s relationships with major automotive Manufacturers and/or the third party’s advertising agencies by increasing revenue for our traditional display advertising.  It is our belief that if the volume of our traffic increases, advertisers will recognize this increased value by agreeing to purchase additional advertising space available on our Company Websites.  Additionally, we believe that our AutoWeb Traffic Product provides an opportunity to increase AutoWeb advertising revenue through additional monetization opportunities for our existing and growing traffic.
  
  Focus on Mobile Technologies.  As consumers increasingly engage with internet content using mobile devices, AutoWeb will continue to focus on mobile technologies that facilitate communication between Dealers and consumers on smart phones and tablets at the time, place, and in a manner preferred by many consumers.   This focus on the mobile platform is a core part of our strategy moving forward regarding lead generation, automotive research, website advertising and traffic generation.
  
  Continuing to Expand our Products and Services. We gather significant amounts of data on consumer intent as it relates to purchasing vehicles.  We intend to use this data to create products and services, including direct business database offerings, that we believe will ultimately help Manufacturers and Dealers market and sell more new and used vehicles.  Our objective is to generate revenues from this asset in the most effective and efficient ways possible.
  
  Strategic Acquisitions, Investments and Alliances. Our goal is to grow and enhance our business. We may do so, in part, through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. We continue to review strategic opportunities that may provide opportunities for growth. We believe that strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances may allow us to increase market share, benefit from advancements in technology and strengthen our business operations by enhancing our product and service offerings.
  
 Our ability to implement the foregoing strategies and plans is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will successfully implement our strategies and plans.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
  
  Seasonality
  
 Our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to various factors, including consumer buying trends, changing economic conditions, Manufacturer incentive programs and actual or threatened severe weather events.   Lead volume is typically highest in summer (third quarter) and winter (first quarter) months, followed by spring (second quarter) and fall (fourth quarter) months.
 Intellectual Property
  
 Our intellectual property includes patents related to our innovations, products and services; trademarks related to our brands, products and services; copyrights in software and creative content; trade secrets; and other intellectual property rights and licenses of various kinds. We seek to protect our intellectual property assets through patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other laws and through contractual provisions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business in order to secure our proprietary rights and additionally limit access to, and disclosure of, our proprietary information.  We have registered trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including AutoWeb®, AutoWeb.com®, the global highway logo, Autobytel, Autobytel.com, MyGarage, iControl by Autobytel®, TextShield®, and Payment Pro®. We cannot provide any assurances that any of our intellectual property rights will be enforceable by us in litigation.

 Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
  
  Competition
  
 In the automotive-related digital marketing services marketplace we compete for Dealer and Manufacturer customers.  Competition with respect to our core Lead referral programs continued to be impacted by changing industry conditions in 2018. We continue to compete with several companies that maintain business models similar to ours, some with greater resources. In addition, competition has increased from larger competitors that traditionally have competed only in the used vehicle market.  Dealers continue to invest in their proprietary websites and traffic acquisition activities, and we expect this trend to continue as Dealers strive to own and control more Lead generating assets under their captive brands.  Additionally, all major Manufacturers that market their vehicles in the U.S. have their own websites that market their vehicles direct to consumers and generate Leads for delivery direct to the Manufacturers’ Dealers. We compete based on quality of our Leads and pricing.
  
 We believe that third-party Leads have been the standard in our industry for many years.  However, we continue to observe new and emerging business models, including pay-per-sale and consumer pay models, relating to the generation and delivery of Leads.  From time to time, new products and services are introduced that take the focus away from third-party Lead generation, which we believe is a profitable way to sell vehicles to in-market buyers.  Dealers and Manufacturers may decide to pull back on their third-party Lead programs to test these new approaches.
  
 In the display advertising marketplace, we compete with major internet portals, transaction-based websites, automotive related companies, numerous lifestyle websites and emerging entrants in the relatively new automotive click revenue medium. According to Emarketer forecasts, the top two digital advertising platforms in the U.S. are Google and Facebook, which Emarketer expects to maintain their dominant hold on digital advertising dollars. We also compete with traditional marketing channels such as print, radio and television.
  
 In pay-per-click advertising, we compete with established search engine providers as well as with a growing number of digital marketing platforms focused on generating dealership website traffic from inventory listings and social media campaigns. In addition, some industry providers who have historically specialized in inventory aggregation or on providing SEM agency services to Dealers are now expanding into the area of website traffic generation. Also, many dealership website providers are now offering traffic solutions as part of their bundle of services.
 
 In addition, some traditional data providers are moving to deliver personalized digital marketing services at scale. These digital marketing hubs and data management platforms provide marketers with standardized access to audience data, content, workflow triggers and operational analytics to automate execution and optimization of multichannel campaigns. These services could be used as a source of lead generation and website traffic by Dealers and Manufacturers and could replace our existing product offerings.
 
  Customers
  
 We have a concentration of credit risk with our automotive industry related accounts receivable balances, particularly with Urban Science Applications (which represents several Manufacturer programs), Media.net Advertising, and General Motors. During 2018, approximately 37% of our total revenues were derived from these three customers, and approximately 41% or $11.2 million of gross accounts receivable related to these three customers at December 31, 2018.  Urban Science Applications accounted for 18% and 21% of total revenues and accounts receivable, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. Media.net Advertising accounted for 10% and 6% of total revenues and accounts receivable, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. General Motors accounted for 9% and 13% of total revenues and accounts receivable, respectively, as of December 31, 2018.
 Operations and Technology
  
 We believe that our future success is significantly dependent upon our ability to provide high-performance, reliable and comprehensive websites, advertising systems; enhance consumer and Dealer product and service offerings; maintain the highest levels of information privacy; and ensure transactional security. Our Company Websites and advertising systems are hosted at secure third-party data center facilities and public cloud providers. These data centers and public cloud systems utilize redundant power infrastructure, redundant network connectivity, multiple locations, distributed services, fire detection and suppression systems and security systems to prevent unauthorized access and to provide high availability of their services, upon which our technology is built, deployed and operated. Our network and computer systems are built on industry standard technology.
  
 System enhancements are primarily intended to accommodate increased traffic across our Company Websites, improve the speed in which Leads and advertisements are processed and introduce new and enhanced products and services. System enhancements entail the implementation of sophisticated new technology and system processes. We implement industry standard automation and delivery processes and employ centralized quality assurance to improve the quality, scalability, security, and availability of our products. We plan to continue to make investments in technology as we believe appropriate.
  
  Government Regulation
  
 We are subject to laws and regulations generally applicable to providers of digital marketing services, including federal and state laws and regulations governing data security and privacy; voice, email and text messaging communications with consumers; unfair and deceptive acts and practices; advertising; contests, sweepstakes and promotions; and content regulation. For additional important information related to government regulation of our business, including governmental regulations relating to the marketing and sale of automobiles, see the information set forth in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Employees
  
 As of March 5, 2019, we had 199 employees.
