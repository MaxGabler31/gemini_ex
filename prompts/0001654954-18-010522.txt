ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Overview
  
 We design, develop and sell rechargeable advanced lithium-ion batteries for industrial uses, including our first-ever UL 2771 Listed lithium-ion “LiFT Pack” forklift batteries. We have developed an innovative high power battery cell management system (“BMS”) and have structured our business around this core technology. Our proprietary BMS provides three critical functions to our battery systems:
  
  ●
  Cell Balancing : This is performed by adjusting the capacity of each cell in a storage system according to temperature, voltage, and internal impedance metrics. This cell balancing management assures longevity and performance of the overall system.

 
  ●
  Monitoring : This is performed by way of a physical connection to individual cells for monitoring voltage and performing calculations from basic metrics to determine remaining capacity and internal impedance. This monitoring assures accurate measurements to best manage the system and assure longevity.

 
  ●
  Error Reporting : This is performed by analyzing data from system monitoring and making decisions on whether the system is operating out of normal specifications. This error reporting is crucial to system management as it ensures ancillary devices are not damaging the storage system and will give the operator an opportunity to take corrective action to maintain long overall system life. Telemetry and remote monitoring are available to enhance this capability.

 
 Using our proprietary BMS technology, we are able to offer completely integrated energy storage solutions or custom modular standalone systems to our clients. In addition, we have also developed a suite of complementary technologies and products that accompany and enhance the abilities of our core BMS products to meet the needs of the growing advanced energy storage market.
  
 Current Business Strategy
  
 We are primarily focusing on the lift equipment market targeting dealers and distributors, and secondarily, on the airport ground support equipment market.  Our strategy was to complete the rollout of a full product lineup for forklifts during the fiscal year 2018 and we have several evaluation units with customers covering the full product line as well as sold units in the ground support equipment market. In January 2016, we obtained certification from Underwriters Laboratory (“UL”), a global safety science organization, on our LiFT Packs for forklift use listed to UL 2271. The UL Listing demonstrates the quality, safety and reliability of our LiFT Pack line for customers, distributors, dealers and OEM partners. We believe we have emerged from this effort with a substantially enhanced product, particularly in the areas of overall design and durability, as well as, features that improve our LiFT Packs’ value and performance for customers. We shipped our first UL certified LiFT Pack to our customers beginning in May 2016.  Currently, we are working with various lift equipment original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), their dealers and battery distributors to bring our advanced energy storage systems to the lift equipment market.  These multiple channels provide a range of customers flexibility in evaluating and purchasing Flux packs.
  
 We have also begun marketing directly to end-users, primarily in the food and beverage industry, with a focus on educating the customer on the many benefits of utilizing lithium-ion batteries over the traditional lead acid batteries in their walkie pallet jack forklifts. Such benefits include no water maintenance, faster charge times, longer lasting and longer run times. Such efforts resulted in Flux being named one of Food Logistics Magazine’s 2017 Champions: Rock Stars of the [Food & Beverage] Supply Chain. This recognition underscores the increasing interest, piloting and shipments of Flux LiFT Packs to power multi-shift operations at a growing base of food industry distribution centers across America.
  
 In addition, the current process of working with the lift equipment sector has included securing “technical approval” by the OEMs for compatibility with their equipment and then developing a sales network utilizing existing battery distributors and equipment dealers. Our product development has included pilot programs and trials with national account end users and industrial equipment manufacturers. Such pilot programs have been highly beneficial in providing us with the much-needed feedback necessary to improve our battery packs. 
  
 Our primary focus in the past few years has been with our entry-level LiFT Pack line to power walkie pallet jack forklifts. We have begun our rollout of packs for the full product line of electric forklifts. Our modular and scalable design enables us to optimize design, inventory, and part count to accommodate natural product extensions. We are now piloting and selling packs to customers for Class 3 end riders, Class 2 reach trucks, and Class 1 counterbalance forklifts. We plan to be competitive in offering UL certified packs and are currently assessing implementation strategy by product sector.

 In addition to the rollout of packs for forklifts, we have developed and are now selling lithium packs for airport ground support equipment. Our first pilot program, organized by Averest, Inc., a leading distributor of industrial batteries and chargers for aviation ground support equipment, was with a leading regional airline at Los Angeles International Airport. The test program was deemed an unqualified success.  This successful pilot program, along with several more recent subsequent trials with other major airlines have resulted in significant sales during fiscal year 2018 to a major service provider of airport ground service. We have also received additional orders from a second major airline for delivery in Fall 2018. The recent traction with these major customers highlights the scalability of our design and engineering capabilities, as well as, our proprietary battery management technology for a broad array of motive power applications. Importantly it also moves us into a customer price point of roughly $20,000 to $34,000 per pack for several power rating alternatives, creating an excellent new leg of growth potential.
  
 In summary, we are developing a suite of complementary technologies and products that utilize our core BMS technology. Sales during the year ended June 30, 2018 were primarily to customers located throughout the United States.
  
 History
  
 We were incorporated in Nevada in 1998.  In May 2012, we changed our name to Flux Power Holdings, Inc. (“Flux”).
  
 We operate our business through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Flux Power, Inc. (“Flux Power”). Flux Power was incorporated in October 2009 to provide solutions to exploit the lithium battery market for small electric vehicles.
Corporate Transactions
  
 On August 10, 2017, we filed a certificate of amendment to our articles of incorporation with the State of Nevada effectuating a reverse split of our common stock at a ratio of 1 for 10, whereby every ten pre-reverse stock split shares of common stock automatically converted into one-post reverse stock split share of common stock, without changing the $0.001 par value or authorized number of our common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split became effective in the State of Nevada on August 18, 2017. Michael Johnson, our director and beneficial owner of Ensenjay Investments, LLC (“Esenjay”), owning a majority of our issued and outstanding common stock approved the Reverse Stock Split on July 7, 2017 by written consent.
  
 In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, proportionate adjustments have been made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all outstanding options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities entitling the holders to purchase, exchange for, or convert into, shares of common stock.  All references to shares of common stock and per share data for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split on a retroactive basis.
  
 DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS
  
 Our Business
  
 We are in the business of energy storage and battery management. In October 2009, we started to develop technologies for the advanced energy storage market and began shipping prototype product in the second quarter of 2010 while continuing to develop our intellectual property portfolio. In 2011, we began shipping Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards validated products and then started shipping ancillary products to enhance our overall product line. Focusing on cell management of large format lithium cells, our technology dramatically extends the battery system life, lowering the overall cost of ownership to a level which makes lithium competitive with lead-acid in numerous applications.

 In January 2016, we obtained certification from Underwriters Laboratory (“UL”) on our LiFT Packs for forklift use listed to UL 2271. The UL Listing, issued by UL, a global safety science organization, demonstrates the quality, safety and reliability of our LiFT Pack line for customers, distributors, dealers and OEM partners. We believe we have emerged from this effort with a substantially enhanced product line, particularly in the areas of overall design and durability, as well as, features that improve our LiFT Packs’ value and performance for customers. We shipped our first UL certified LiFT Pack to our customers beginning in May 2016. Our LiFT Packs are now the first and only UL Listed lithium-ion batteries available across the brands of the major OEMs.
  
 In April 2016, we began piloting our custom-developed, 72-volt battery pack for use with electric aviation ground support equipment.  The pilot program, organized by Averest, Inc., a leading distributor of industrial batteries and chargers for aviation ground support equipment, was with a leading regional airline at Los Angeles International Airport. The test program wrapped up in August 2016 and was deemed an unqualified success.  Now, working with a distributor focused on the airlines, we are planning to provide more test units, to support the sales cycle, for additional airlines. The successful development and 3-month pilot highlights the scalability of our design and engineering capabilities, as well as, our proprietary battery management technology for a broad array of motive power applications. Importantly it also moves us into a customer price point of roughly $20,000 to $34,000 per pack for several power rating alternatives, creating an excellent new leg of growth potential.
  
 We have since developed, field tested our evaluation units, and sold units of LiFT Packs for use in Class 3 end riders, Class 2 reach trucks, and Class 1 counterbalance forklifts. The evaluation units have provided us with crucial information on the further development of the battery packs in order to better serve this market.
  
  We design, develop, and sell rechargeable advanced energy storage systems. We have developed an innovative high power battery cell management system (“BMS”) and have structured our business around this core technology. Our proprietary BMS provides three critical functions to our battery systems:
  
  ●
  Cell Balancing : This is performed by continuously adjusting the capacity of each cell in a storage system according to temperature, voltage, and internal impedance metrics. This management assures longevity and performance of the overall system.

 
  ●
  Monitoring : This is performed through temperature probes, a physical connection to individual cells for voltage and calculations from basic metrics to determine remaining capacity and internal impedance. This monitoring assures accurate measurements to best manage the system and assure longevity.

 
  ●
  Error reporting : This is performed by analyzing data from monitoring each individual cell and making decisions on whether the individual cell or the system is operating out of normal specifications. This error reporting is crucial to system management as it ensures ancillary devices are not damaging your storage system and will give the operator an opportunity to take corrective action to maintain long overall system life. Telemetry and remote monitoring services are available to enhance this capability.

 
 Using our proprietary battery management technology, we are able to offer completely integrated energy storage solutions or custom modular standalone systems to our clients. In addition, we have also developed a suite of complementary technologies and products that accompany and enhance the abilities of our BMS to meet the needs of the growing advanced energy storage market.
  
 Industry Background for the Energy Storage Market
  
 The energy storage market has grown over recent years from one mostly reliant on lead-acid technologies created in the 1800s to one leveraging advanced chemistries and the corresponding ability to store more energy in less space. Back-up power has increasingly grown to depend on telematics to accurately gauge system health. Electric vehicles have adopted lighter weight energy storage to increase range and payload abilities and grid management applications have sought to increase the cycle life of their systems to assure better returns on their investments over the long term. We believe that all of these needs will cause the advanced energy storage market to grow exponentially over the next five (5) to ten (10) years.
 Lift Equipment - Material Handling Equipment
  
 We currently focus our business on lift equipment. Lift equipment commonly called a forklift truck (also called a lift truck, a fork truck, or a forklift) is a powered industrial truck used to lift and transport materials. The modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. The forklift has since become an indispensable piece of equipment in manufacturing and warehousing operations. Lift equipment is produced in a range of power capacities from smaller lift type equipment such as a Walkie (ie., pallet jack) to a ride-on forklift. A segment of forklifts, particularly larger forklifts, use propane with an internal combustion engine for power. This segment has been experiencing a secular decline, with a shift to electric powered forklifts. The larger fleets of forklifts more typically use battery powered forklifts. Lift equipment vehicles are not new technology and don’t require new testing, which can cause delays in product placement. The existing lift equipment market primarily uses lead-acid batteries, which is a legacy technology and can lead to customer dissatisfaction with life cycles, performance, and additional maintenance costs. We believe the replacement of lead-acid batteries with lithium cells dramatically extends run time and the battery system life, lowering the overall cost of ownership to a level which makes lithium very competitive with lead-acid in numerous applications.

  Other Equipment Solutions
  
 We have produced battery packs on an opportunistic basis for applications including robotic mining equipment, portable packs for field operations by the U.S. military, and solar, grid-tie energy storage in an office setting. We currently are building and selling lithium packs for airport equipment, commonly called ground support equipment (“GSE”), to power the baggage/cargo trucks. These packs provide much higher levels of power ratings of up to 600 amp hours at 72 volts. Initial customer response indicates our packs to be performing very well with high satisfaction.
Battery Types
  
 The most common battery technologies currently available to address forklift equipment, electric vehicle and grid management markets include the following:
  
 Lead-acid Batteries: Lead-acid is one of the most developed battery technologies as it has been in use since the 1800s, with the modern lead-acid battery introduced in 1913. It is relatively easy to manufacture and is an inexpensive and ubiquitous energy storage medium. Automobile manufacturers use lead-acid for starter batteries and lead-acid has been used widely in electric vehicle and grid management solutions. Unfortunately, lead-acid batteries weigh more per unit of stored energy and have less power output per unit mass versus advanced energy storage system technologies and thus are not well suited for advanced applications such as grid management devices and electric vehicles. In addition, lead can be hazardous to the environment and there are efforts in many countries to phase this legacy technology out over time.
  
 Nickel Batteries: Nickel batteries, NiCd (nickel cadmium) or NiMH (nickel metal hydride) are durable and inexpensive technologies with relatively high power. Unfortunately, cadmium is not a safe material and exposure can result in health hazard to humans and damage to the environment. An alternative to the toxic NiCd battery is NiMH, which has greater energy versus lead-acid batteries and is more suitable to a wider range of applications. The NiMH was used in early electric vehicles and some other bulk storage applications. These chemistries are not as energy dense as advanced lithium batteries and thus are now being displaced out of the advanced energy storage system market by more energy dense chemistries.
  
  Legacy Lithium Chemistries: Lithium batteries are more energy dense versus lead-acid, NiCd or NiMH batteries and are more volumetrically and weight efficient. Introduced in the 1990s, lithium batteries made their way into portable electronics devices like laptop computers and cell phones. Unfortunately, early lithium cobalt was prone to heat issues when arranged in large groups and if a battery cell were compromised a fire or explosion could result. This attribute made early lithium batteries unsuitable for large grid management devices and electric vehicles. The cobalt in these early cells was also a more expensive metal versus the compounds used in modern lithium batteries. 
  
 Advanced Energy Storage Lithium Batteries: The current generation of advanced energy storage lithium batteries was developed in the late 1990s. These new chemistries improve upon energy density, volumetrics and weight metrics. There have also been great enhancements to the safety of these modern lithium batteries. Heat and catastrophic failure issues do not plague advanced energy storage systems today. There has also been a significant increase in modern lithium batteries’ cycle life. This makes today’s advanced energy storage systems the most conducive to electric vehicle and grid management use.
  
 Other Technologies: Ultra capacitors and fuel cells have been proposed as potential alternatives or replacements to lithium batteries. Ultra capacitors deliver high power and have an extended cycle life but suffer from poor energy density. This makes them suitable for small burst power needs but not for grid storage and electric vehicle devices. Fuel cells generate energy converting a fuel, typically hydrogen to energy. Fuel cell systems offer good energy density and short charge times, but are poor performers in terms of power and cycle life. Fuel cell systems are suitable for devices with small power needs and short life spans but are generally not popular in forklifts due to initial capital cost for hydrogen generation or purchase.
  
  Current Advanced Energy Storage Application Needs
  
 There are a number of features required of advanced energy storage applications today, such as:
  
 Target Application Power: An advanced energy storage system must be able to deliver the electrical power required. Electrical power, measured in watts, is the rate at which electrical energy is delivered. Electric industrial vehicles, in particular, need enough power to assure smooth acceleration through a systems discharge curve and grid management systems need enough power to meet load demands.
  
 Duration of Charge/Run Times: An advanced energy storage system must be able to provide a certain total amount of electrical energy. Total electrical energy is measured in watt hours and is the product of power and time. Advanced energy storage systems with greater energy can perform for a longer duration when compared to legacy technologies. For example, lithium-ion batteries provide up to 25% longer run times than legacy batteries of comparable capacity, or amps per hour rating. The total electrical energy of an advanced energy storage system determines an electric vehicle’s range per charge and a grid management device’s total power.
  
   
7


  
 
 High/Sustained Power: The energy that an advanced energy storage system can provide in total depends on the power requirements of the device in which it is installed. When an advanced energy storage system delivers higher power, the available energy of the advanced energy storage system is less than if it was delivering lower power. Advanced energy storage systems are better suited to deliver high power versus legacy lead-acid. For example, the higher power required to push a vehicle like an electrically propelled boat through the water would be detrimental to legacy power technologies because their lack of ability to operate as efficiently in high power applications. Advanced energy storage systems are able to supply a high power required without detriment to the energy storage system.
  
 Safe Operation: For almost all industrial equipment, electric vehicle and grid management solutions, the safety of an advanced energy storage system is of utmost importance. Legacy lead-acid batteries tend to get hot with heavy operation and the toxic nature of these legacy chemistries can be troublesome in the event of a cell breach. Advanced energy storage systems focus on chemistries that do not violently react with oxygen so a cell breach is less likely to result in an explosion or fire. Lithium iron phosphate is known to be the “lithium chemistry of choice” for many large format applications due to its lower cost and greater safety attributes.
  
 Extended Life: The cycle life of an advanced energy storage system is the total number of times the system can be charged and discharged while still performing to specification in the device installed. Legacy lead-acid technologies often do not perform to specification past 500 cycles in industrial equipment applications, especially for the smaller forklifts. In comparison, an advanced energy storage system can last three to five times as long in the same application.
  
 Volumetrics and Weight: The weight and size of advanced energy storage systems are of crucial importance to both portable power and grid management devices. In electric vehicles, where packaging space is precious, a lightweight system can greatly enhance range. In grid management devices that seek to extend current back-up power time benefit from better volumetrics and devices that shift load or peak-shave for improved average energy costs benefit from small advanced energy storage systems that keep connections between cells at a minimum.
  
 Lowest Cost: Advanced energy storage systems provide power dense solutions with extended cycle life which, together, equate to very cost conscious solutions for most applications in the industrial vehicle equipment, portable power, and grid management market segments. We believe that, in our products, advanced energy storage systems can cost much less than legacy lead-acid technologies over the course of the product life.
  
 Our Products and Services
  
 We seek to gain market share in the advanced energy storage segment, with current focus on lift equipment, using our system technologies that extend life, add much needed safety mechanisms, and communication and cycle life memory tools. We are focused on cell and system management tools. From our modular 24-volt to 72-volt energy storage solutions to stackable charging, we provide the building blocks to create custom systems designed for a diverse set of applications. We provide capable systems that meet cost and performance targets which we believe, in many cases and based on the life cycle data of the lead-acid batteries provided by the manufacturers; outperform traditional lead-acid technologies on both metrics. Our systems use lithium-ion cells that are denser in energy than traditional lead-acid batteries, which allow our batteries to hold more charge over the same weight. In addition, our BMS protects the lithium-ion batteries enabling the lithium-ion batteries to reach their full life and cycle potential and outlasting lead-acid based batteries which would have to be replaced and thereby adding additional costs over the same time period. Our systems manage individual cells and their charge cycles, which generally allows for more consistent discharge capability and ease of maintenance over an unmanaged battery. Through our BMS, we have enhanced battery systems overall to provide safer, more reliable and extended life rechargeable energy storage systems for applications including motive, marine, industrial, military, stationary, and grid management markets.
  
 BMS. Our proprietary BMS product provides three critical functions for battery systems: cell balancing, monitoring parameters and reporting errors to the system. Our BMS monitors parameters and reports errors to other devices, which can then determine the best action to take to prevent failure. Another BMS function is system cell balancing. The BMS will analyze each battery cell in the system during charge and discharge to determine which cells to balance to prevent overcharging and allow the other batteries to catch-up and equalize capacity throughout the system. 
  
 Battery Modules. We supply high-power, energy-dense advanced energy storage modules for industrial equipment, electrical vehicles, and governmental applications. Our entry level, walkie pallet jack pack consists of the Flux Power 24-volt lithium pack and individual 3.2 volt cells. Our scalable design includes products for 36-volt, 48-volt, and 72-volt applications in various sizes to 900AH to provide the full product line-up. We offer varying chemistries and configurations based on the applications. Our battery modules are designed for our BMS.  We currently use Lithium-ion cells, specifically lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4). We are not in the business of developing new battery cell chemistries and are thus “agnostic” as to chemistry and can take advantage of new chemistries when available in the market.

 Chargers. Our smart charging solutions are designed to interface with our battery management system. We offer 24-volt onboard chargers for our Class 3 products, and smart “wall mounted” chargers for large applications. 
  
 Application Integration. We are one of the few developers to successfully integrate lithium packs in a variety of applications including forklifts and related industrial equipment. The technology complexity of lithium requires knowledgeable engineering and testing.
  
 Marketing and Sales
  
  Customer Concentrations
  
 We currently sell products directly to our customers, through OEMs, lift equipment dealers, battery distributors and the ultimate end-user. Our direct customers vary from small companies to Fortune 500 companies.
  
 During the year ended June 30, 2018, we had two major customers that each represented more than 10% of our revenues on an individual basis, or approximately $3,181,000 or 77% of our total revenues.

 Technology
  
 We believe our cell management and communication tools extend battery system life and improve system performance by managing individual cells in a system, communicating individual cell conditions to ancillary devices, and communicating individual cell conditions to other devices which either require or supply power. Whether it is lift equipment or related industrial equipment, we provide capable systems that meet cost and performance targets which we believe, in many cases and based on the life cycle data of the lead-acid batteries provided by the manufacturers; outperform traditional lead-acid technologies on both metrics. Our systems use lithium-ion cells that are denser in energy than traditional lead-acid batteries, which allow our batteries to hold more charge over the same weight. In addition, our BMS protects the lithium-ion batteries enabling the lithium-ion batteries to reach their full life and cycle potential and outlasting lead-acid based batteries which would have to be replaced and thereby adding additional costs over the same time period. Our systems manage individual cells and their charge cycles, which generally allow for more consistent discharge capability and ease of maintenance over an unmanaged battery by:

 Production process
  
 Except for charger components and battery cells, we design and assemble all of our own products in-house and outsource manufacturing when possible.
  
 Batteries. Since our battery management system and battery modules are not tied to any specific lithium-ion battery chemistry, we can source our batteries from a variety of manufacturers to meet our needs as well as our customers’ needs. During this past year, we have sourced our batteries from several suppliers, all having manufacturing operations in China, with some having wholesale warehouses in the United States.

 Battery Modules and Packs. We design all of our battery modules and packs in-house. In addition, we occasionally design and assemble prototype battery packs and storage systems for our customers.
  
 Chargers. We currently buy chargers from several sources, all of whom are U.S. based suppliers.
  
 BMS. We design our BMS modules/boards and have two granted patents. We source manufacturing of the boards to two local board houses. We are currently developing further technology enhancements to this BMS technology, including the use of more efficient board components, and are planning to file related patents.
  
 In-House Product Assembly:
  
 BMS units, Chargers and CAN Current Sensors: Units are outsourced, programmed and tested at our facility before shipping.
  
 Battery Cell Modules: We receive completed module cases and lids for applications of 24-volt, 36-volt, 48-volt, and 72-volt. Cells are packed in the module cases, connected to BMS, and secured in place. Lids with BMS installed are programmed and calibrated. Each full unit is sealed and tested before shipping. 
 
 Volume sales will enable cost reductions by:
  
 Manufacturability Optimization: We are currently building products to be as robust and full-featured as possible to meet initial demand that typically reflects smaller quantity needs. With investment in equipment and process, labor assembly and process can drive cost reductions.
  
 Low Cost Designs: As we receive more feedback from customers, we will strive to achieve cost reduction to improve alignment of pack features and quality that meet customer satisfaction at reduced cost.
  
 Advanced Manufacturing Capabilities: We are currently seeking out advanced manufacturing relationships to further enhance our abilities.
  
 Suppliers
  
 We obtain a limited number of components and supplies included in our products from a small group of suppliers. During the year ended June 30, 2018 we had three suppliers who accounted for more than 10% of our total purchases, on an individual basis. Purchases for these three suppliers totaled $2,285,000 or 50% of our total purchases.
  
 During the year ended June 30, 2017 we had three suppliers who accounted for more than 10% of our total purchases, on an individual basis. Purchases for these three suppliers totaled $1,665,000 or 57% of our total purchases.
  
 In the past we have sourced Lithium batteries from a number of suppliers. We continuously assess our battery sourcing to improve consistency, responsiveness, and quality.
  
 Research and Development
  
 Research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were approximately $1,956,000 and $1,052,000, respectively. Such expenses consist primarily of materials, supplies, salaries and personnel related expenses, stock-based compensation expense, consulting costs and other expenses. Research and development expenses in fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (“Fiscal 2018”) were higher than fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 (“Fiscal 2017”) primarily due to the development and implementation of the higher capacity packs for Class 1, 2, and 3 forklifts. As we continue to develop our product line, we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to be a substantial part of our focus. We currently perform our research and development at our facility in Vista, California. We seek to develop innovative new and improved products for cell and system management along with associated communication, display, current sensing and charging tools.
Competition
  
 Our competitors in the lift equipment sector are primarily major lead acid battery manufacturers, including, but not limited to: GNB, Hawker, Deka, Enersys, Crown Battery, Douglas and Interstate. We are not aware that these suppliers currently offer lithium-based products for lift equipment in any significant volume to end users, equipment dealers, OEMs or battery distributors. In addition, there are several OEMs who offer a lithium battery on Class 3 forklifts for sale only with their own forklifts. There are a growing number of lithium pack providers entering the market, small in volume sales, most of whom are adding a lithium product to existing power products. These competitors entering the market typically do not have ties to the major battery companies or OEM lift equipment manufacturers. We do expect more entrants to the lithium market, especially from the major battery companies over time. Given the multi-billion dollar addressable market, we believe more entrants into lithium showcase the advantages over lead acid.

 We believe that we have several technological and business advantages over our competitors, which will lead to our success in the advanced energy storage market. Our concentration on cell and system management tools has allowed us to compete with a much lower capitalization structure. Further, since our BMS is not based on any specific cell chemistry, we can source cells from different manufacturers based on the performance needs and cost. This flexibility in cell sourcing allows us to provide complete storage systems at a lower cost versus our current competition. We are also differentiated by the ability to integrate battery packs successfully into a variety of applications. 
  
 Our UL Listing, received in January 2016 and the first such certification for forklift application, demonstrates the quality, safety and reliability of our LiFT Pack line for customers, distributors, dealers and OEM partners. We believe we have emerged from this effort as a market leader in quality and experience.
  
 Our marketing and sales strategy is to actively pursue the following market segments:
  
 Lift Equipment - Material Handling Equipment: The advantage of the lift equipment market is that it is an indispensable piece of equipment in manufacturing and warehousing operations. Lift equipment vehicles are not new technology and don’t require new testing which can cause delays in product placement. The existing lift equipment market uses lead-acid batteries, which is outdated technology and can lead to customer dissatisfaction with life cycles, performance, and additional maintenance costs. The replacement of lead-acid batteries with lithium cells dramatically extends the battery system life, lowering the overall cost of ownership to a level which makes lithium competitive with lead-acid in numerous applications. We believe with marketing efforts we will be able to reach larger target markets.
  
 Ground Support Equipment: Our products’ telematics, modularity, longevity and low-cost solutions fit with airport equipment solutions, commonly known as ground support equipment, operated by all airlines to transport baggage and related cargo. These applications are well suited to our modular and scalable pack designs and benefit from our pack innovation derived from LiFT Packs and the related harsh environments. We have conducted successful pilot programs and plan to continue introduction of these packs to a variety of customers, with expectations of significant revenue opportunity in the coming year.
  
 Military (Defense) and Municipal: Our products’ longevity and easy integration make it a fit for energy storage applications for both the military and municipal markets. Although these markets have longer integration timelines, we believe they represent potentially significant additions to our revenue mix in future periods.
  
 Intellectual Property
  
 Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents pending, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. In addition to such factors as innovation, technological expertise and experienced personnel, we believe that a strong patent position is important to remain competitive.
  
 As of June 30, 2018, we have one issued patent and three trademark registrations protecting the Flux Power name and logo. We intend to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology and to seek protection of our intellectual property internationally in a broad range of areas. We do not know whether any of our efforts will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection.
  
 Government Regulations
  
 Product Safety Regulations. Our products are subject to product safety regulations by Federal, state, and local organizations. Accordingly, we may be required, or may voluntarily determine to obtain approval of our products from one or more of the organizations engaged in regulating product safety. These approvals could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and, if redesign were necessary, could result in a delay in the introduction of our products in various markets and applications.

 Environmental Regulations. Federal, state, and local regulations impose significant environmental requirements on the manufacture, storage, transportation, and disposal of various components of advanced energy storage systems. Although we believe that our operations are in material compliance with current applicable environmental regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities.
  
 Moreover, Federal, state, and local governments may enact additional regulations relating to the manufacture, storage, transportation, and disposal of components of advanced energy storage systems. Compliance with such additional regulations could require us to devote significant time and resources and could adversely affect demand for our products. There can be no assurance that additional or modified regulations relating to the manufacture, storage, transportation, and disposal of components of advanced energy systems will not be imposed.
  
 Occupational Safety and Health Regulations. The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (“Cal/OSHA”) and other regulatory agencies have jurisdiction over the operations of our Vista, California facility. Because of the risks generally associated with the assembly of advanced energy storage systems we expect rigorous enforcement of applicable health and safety regulations. Frequent audits by or changes, in the regulations issued by Cal/OSHA, or other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our operations, may cause unforeseen delays and require significant time and resources from our technical staff.
  
 Employees
  
 As of June 30, 2018, we had fifty-three (53) full-time employees. We engage outside consultants for business development and operations or other functions from time to time. None of our employees are currently represented by a trade union.
