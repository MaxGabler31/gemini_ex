Item 1. Business.



SATIVUS TECH CORP. (formerly SEEDO CORP.) (the “Company”, “Our” or “We”) was formed on January 16, 2015, under the laws of the State of Delaware. Prior to September 14, 2018, we were solely a provider of risk management and asset protection (“RAP”) services for businesses, individuals and families. On September 14, 2018, (“the Company”) executed an Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement with Eroll Grow Tech Ltd. (“Eroll”), an Israeli Corporation that was formed on May 18, 2015 under the laws of the state of Israel. On September 17, 2018, the Board of Directors adopted an Amendment to its Articles, changing the name of the Corporation to SEEDO CORP. Since the Acquisition of Eroll and through to December 31, 2019, Eroll produced a plant growing device managed and controlled by an artificial intelligent algorithm, allowing consumers to grow their own herbs and vegetables effortlessly from seed to plant, while providing optimal conditions to assure premium quality produce year-round.



During the third quarter of 2019, Eroll was experiencing financial and operational difficulties and during 2020, entered liquidation proceedings through the Nazareth District Court of the State of Israel (the “Court”). On March 25, 2020, the Court approved the purchase of all of Eroll’s assets by a non-related third-party and therefore, the Company no longer has any legal ties nor privity with Eroll.



On July 19, 2020, the Company formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary in Israel, Hachevra Legiduley Pkaot Beisrael Ltd. (the “New Subsidiary”), to develop a fully automated and remotely managed system for growing saffron and other vegetables. On November 5, 2020, the New Subsidiary changed its name to Saffron-Tech Ltd. (or “Saffron”).



The Company, through Saffron Tech, is focusing on its in-house research and development of agriculture technology products, among others, in the fields of exotic plants and mushrooms. Saffron Tech plans to roll out its proof of concept in the coming months. This technology is designed to provide turnkey automated growing containers for high-quality, high-yield saffron all year round. The Company is in advanced stages of developing and testing a fully automated and remotely managed system for growing high-quality, high-yield saffron anywhere and anytime.



The Company’s proof of concept utilizes the “Grow Next to Consumer” policy and is therefore sustainable and fit the COVID-19 restrictions on transport. It is also environmentally friendly, using economic levels of water, space, fertilizer, and energy. Accounting to the Company’s calculations, we believe that the controlled indoor growing area will produce ten times more yield compared to the same land area using traditional methods. The sealed environment eliminates the need for harmful pesticides and herbicides, producing a clean and safe product that is easy to control from anywhere. The Company’s solution is easily scalable and pre-designed to quickly grow operations.



Saffron is used in many industries, such as the food industry, particularly by famous chefs and Michelin starred restaurants, the natural cosmetics industry and the natural medicine industry and as a dye in the textile industry. Medicinal claims as an anti-depressant, antioxidant, and antiseptic are constantly increasing.



The global saffron market size was valued at $1 Billion in 2019 and is anticipated to attain a revenue based CAGR of 7.3% from 2020 to 2027. The market is expected to grow over the next few years on account of demand from the pharmaceutical sector, particularly in countries with rapid population expansion.



Since the incorporation Saffron Tech, Saffron Tech has hired three employees and several consultants to commence the roll out of our proof of concept. Saffron Tech has signed several agreements with Israeli companies, including Growin Ltd (“Growin”) and the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture’s research organization – The Volcani Center (“Volcani”). Growin is the owner of proprietary systems for indoor agriculture and Saffron Tech has acquired the exclusive right to market, sell and commercialize our product based on Growin’s hydroponic machines. Volcani will assist Saffron Tech in writing the protocols required to grow saffron in a controlled and automated way, including the use of robotics and AI.

Assuming the maximum amount is raised, the Company will own approximately 80% of the Saffron Tech. The Crowd Funding Round was closed on February 16, 2021, having raised the full amount. Fund raising expenses accumulated to $155 and the net amount raised through Pipelbiz was $1.4 million.



On August 10, 2021, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Saffron Tech, has been awarded a $446 thousand grant from the Israeli Innovation Authority (“IIA”).

The funds will be allocated to enable the company to expand its facilities, allowing it to grow more saffron for commercial use. As of December 31, 2021, Saffron Tech received a total of $268 from the IIA.
