Item 1. BUSINESS
Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc., collectively with its subsidiaries ("PPIH", "Company" or "Registrant"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of products in one reportable segment: Piping Systems. In February 2017, the Company began the re-naming and re-branding of MFRI, Inc. under the Perma-Pipe name now that the Company operates in a single business segment under the Perma-Pipe brand. The Company believes this decision will better serve its mission and strategy, positions it well in the industry and global market, and positions it to leverage the strong reputation Perma-Pipe has established since beginning operations. The Company's name change to Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc. was effective March 20, 2017. The Company's common stock is reported under its new ticker symbol "PPIH" since March 21, 2017. The Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. Years and balances described as 2017 and 2016 are for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Products and services. The Company engineers, designs, manufactures and sells specialty piping systems, and leak detection and location systems. Specialty piping systems include: (i) industrial and secondary containment piping systems for transporting chemicals, hazardous fluids and petroleum products, (ii) insulated and jacketed district heating and cooling ("DHC") piping systems for efficient energy distribution to multiple locations from central energy plants, and (iii) the coating and/or insulation of oil and gas gathering flow and long lines for oil or mineral transportation. The Company's leak detection and location systems are sold with its piping systems or on a stand-alone basis, to monitor areas where fluid intrusion may contaminate the environment, endanger personal safety, cause a fire hazard, impair essential services or damage equipment or property.
The Company frequently engineers and custom fabricates to job site dimensions and incorporates provisions for thermal expansion due to varying temperatures. This custom fabrication helps to minimize the amount of field labor required by the installation contractor. Most of the Company's piping systems are produced for underground installations and, therefore, require trenching, which is the responsibility of the general contractor, and done by unaffiliated installation contractors.
The Company’s piping systems are typically sold as a part of large discrete projects, and both the domestic and Canadian customer demand varies by season. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A")."
Operating Facilities: The Company operates its business from the following locations:

Perma-Pipe, Inc. | Perma-Pipe Middle East FZC 
Niles, IL | Fujairah, United Arab Emirates 
New Iberia, LA | Perma-Pipe Saudi Arabia, LLC 
Lebanon, TN | Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Perma-Pipe Canada, Ltd. | Perma-Pipe India Pvt. Ltd 
Camrose, Alberta, Canada | Gandhidham, India 

Customers and sales channels. The Company's customer base is industrially and geographically diverse. In the United States, the Company employs national and regional sales managers who use and assist a network of independent manufacturers' representatives, none of whom sells products that are competitive with the Company's piping systems. The Company employs a direct sales force as well as an agent network in the U.S., Canada, and in several countries in the Middle and Far East to market and sell products and services.
On January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's net sales.
Three customers accounted for 34.9% of accounts receivable on January 31, 2018, and two customers accounted for 33.2% of accounts receivable at January 31, 2017.
Backlog. The Company’s backlog on January 31, 2018 was $46.7 million compared to $44.6 million on January 31, 2017, all of which is expected to be completed within the next 12 months. The Company defines backlog as the revenue value resulting from confirmed customer purchase orders that have not yet been recognized as revenue. However, by industry practice, orders may be canceled or modified at any time. If a customer cancels an order, the customer is normally responsible for all finished goods produced or shipped, all direct and indirect costs incurred and also for a reasonable allowance for anticipated profits. No assurance can be given that these amounts will be recovered after cancellation. Any cancellation or delay in orders may result in lower than expected revenue.
Intellectual property. The Company owns several patents covering its piping and electronic leak detection systems. The patents are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate because the Company believes its sales would not be materially reduced if patent protection were not available. The Company owns numerous trademarks connected with its piping and leak detection systems including the following U.S. trademarks: Perma-Pipe®, Chil-Gard®, Double Quik®, Escon-A®, FluidWatch®, Galva-Gard®, Polytherm®, Pal-AT®, Stereo-Heat®,

LiquidWatch®, PalCom®, Xtru-therm®, Auto-Therm®, Pex-Gard®, Multi-Therm®, Ultra-Therm®, Cryo-Gard®, Sleeve-Gard®, Electro-Gard® and Sulphur-Therm®. The Company also owns a number of trademarks throughout the world. Some of the Company's more significant trademarks include: Auto-Therm®, Cryo-Gard®, Electro-Gard®, Sleeve-Gard®, Permalert®, Pal-AT®, Perma-Pipe®, Polytherm®, Ric-Wil®, and Xtru-therm®.
Suppliers. The basic raw materials used in production are pipes and tubes made of carbon steel, alloy, copper, ductile iron, plastics and various chemicals such as polyols, isocyanate, urethane resin, polyethylene and fiberglass, mostly purchased in bulk quantities. The Company believes there are currently adequate supplies and sources of availability of these needed raw materials. Steel prices began to rise in early 2018 and are expected to continue to rise with seasonal demand and an improving economy in the first and second quarters of 2018. The Company expects normal seasonal price movement during 2018 with steel prices higher than average when compared to 2017. The Company has been updating its quoting system for the movements in steel prices and expects to recover these price differentials through price increases in its products.
The sensor cables used in the Company's leak detection and location systems are manufactured to the Company's specifications by companies regularly engaged in manufacturing such cables. The Company owns patents for some of the features of its sensor cables. The Company assembles the monitoring component of its leak detection and location systems from components purchased from many sources.
Competition. The piping systems market is highly competitive. The Company believes its principal competition consists of between 10 to 20 major competitors and more small competitors. The Company believes that quality, service, engineering design capabilities and support, a comprehensive product line, timely execution, plant location and price are key competitive factors. The Company also believes it has a more comprehensive line for DHC than any competitor. Some competitors have greater financial resources and cost advantages as a result of manufacturing a limited range of products or have a manufacturing plant closer to the point of final product deployment.
Research and Development. The Company primarily conducts its research and development function on a contract-by-contract basis to accommodate the product specifications mandated by its customers. The Company does not maintain a standalone research and development function.
Government regulation. The demand for the Company's leak detection and location systems and secondary containment piping systems, which is a small percentage of the Company's total annual piping sales, is driven by federal and state environmental regulation with respect to hazardous waste. The U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act requires, in some cases, that the storage, handling and transportation of fluids through underground pipelines feature secondary containment and leak detection. The U.S. National Emission Standard for hydrocarbon airborne particulates requires reduction of airborne volatile organic compounds and fugitive emissions. Under this regulation, many major refineries are required to recover fugitive vapors and dispose of the recovered material in a process sewer system, which then becomes a hazardous secondary waste system that must be contained. Although there can be no assurances as to the ultimate effects of these governmental regulations, the Company believes such regulations may increase the demand for its piping systems products. 
In Canada, due to provincial and federal government regulations, the National Energy Board (NEB) requires that all buried pipelines that cross provincial boundaries or the United States-Canada border, have an anti-corrosion coating system applied. The Company believes that this regulation has a positive effect on demand for its products due to the Company's unique expertise with respect to anti-corrosion coating. 
Employees
As of January 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 196 employees working in the United States, of which approximately 79 were under two collective bargaining agreements, one expiring on March 31, 2019, and the other on April 30, 2020. There were approximately 469 employees working at the Company's international locations. The Company considers its relationship with its employees to be good.
