BUSINESS STRATEGY
We are the worldwide leader in manufacturing and distribution of wheels, tires, assemblies and undercarriage products and serve our customers' needs through product innovation and quality service in the Company's key markets: agriculture, earthmoving/construction, and consumer. Other strategic considerations include:
•Tire Technology 
The Company has developed an LSW tire technology, featuring a larger rim diameter and a smaller sidewall than standard tires. With LSW tire technology, which has been widely adopted within the automotive industry, users experience reduced power hop, road lope, soil compaction, and fuel consumption as well as improved safety and performance. Both power hop and road lope can disturb ride quality and impede equipment performance. The benefits correspond to Titan’s markets through superior comfort, ride and fuel economy. Our LSW proprietary larger footprint agricultural products provide a framework for expansion 
of carbon sinks, reducing soil compaction and improving soil health. Reduced soil compaction from the larger footprint of the 
LSW product requires less tillage thus reducing the release of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Titan continues to enhance the LSW technology and expand its LSW product and other tire offerings in both the agricultural and construction segments. 
•Increase Aftermarket Tire Business
The Company has concentrated on increasing Titan's presence in the tire aftermarket, which historically has been somewhat less cyclical than the OEM market. The aftermarket also offers the potential for higher profit margins and is a larger market. Titan’s strategy to enhance the Company's aftermarket platform focuses on improving the customer experience and product positioning in key sales markets. To support this strategy, the Company has a dedicated salesforce for the tire aftermarket.
•Improve Operating Efficiencies
The Company regularly works to improve the operating efficiency of assets and manufacturing facilities. Titan integrates each facility’s strengths through, among other things, transfer of equipment and business to the facilities that are best equipped to handle the work, which enables Titan to increase utilization and spread operating costs over a greater volume of products. Titan continues to implement a comprehensive program to refurbish, modernize, and enhance the technology of its manufacturing equipment. Titan has also made investments to streamline processes, increase productivity, and lower costs in the selling, general and administrative areas.
•Enhance Design Capabilities and New Product Development
Equipment manufacturers constantly face changing industry dynamics. Titan directs its business and marketing strategy to understand and address the needs of customers and demonstrate the advantages of products. In particular, the Company often collaborates with customers in the design of new and enhanced products and recommends modified products to customers based on the Company's own market information. These value-added services enhance Titan’s relationships with customers. The Company tests new designs and technologies and develops manufacturing methods to improve product quality, performance, and cost.
•Reduction of Non-Core Assets and Other Strategic Considerations
The Company has reduced non-core assets and continues to explore ways to improve underperforming assets in an effort to
improve cash flow and working capital and reduce debt.
The Company’s expertise in the manufacture of off-highway wheels, tires, and undercarriage systems and components has
permitted it to take advantage of opportunities to acquire businesses that complement this product line. In the future, Titan may
consider strategic partnerships, joint ventures or make additional strategic acquisitions of businesses that have an off-highway
focus. The Company continually explores worldwide opportunities to expand its manufacturing and distribution capabilities in
order to serve new and existing geographies.
SUSTAINABILITY
Titan is committed to be a positive force in the lives of our employees, customers and in the communities they work and live. The Company has made significant progress on the environmental, social and governance (ESG) areas by creating and updating various policies, preparing new forms of monitoring, and expanding disclosure of data regarding operations. 
The protection of the environment is a core value at Titan. We are dedicated to the continual improvement of environmental performance of our global operations. In 2021, Titan solidified these values becoming a signatory of the United National Global Compact, a set of international principles focusing on universal human rights, labor, the environment, and anti- corruption. From there, we began revisiting our policies with both new policies and adopting updates which reflect these core values. With each of these updates, we have taken a stand against child and forced labor, harassment and discrimination at any of our sites or supplier or contractor sites. We will adhere to these ethical standards and will follow outlined procedures for any infraction. 
Titan works toward continuous improvement in considering our impact on the environment. Whether it is creating tires that reduce soil compaction, which also help our customers increase yield, closely tracking our business operations to identify reduced use of harmful solvents, finding use for recycled materials or discovering new ways to design our facilities more sustainably, we are committed to making ongoing strides toward lessening our impact on our world.
As part of our commitment to the environment, Titan has Environmental Management Systems in place across many of our global facilities. Our systems monitor and track energy consumption, waste management, pollution prevention, emissions control and overall environmental health throughout our footprint, which enables us to measure and continuously improve environmental performance. We also conduct routine internal environmental assessment audits at our facilities. Currently 17 of our locations are ISO 14001 certified, making up 46% of our facility footprint. We continue to strive for efficiency and operational improvements to lessen our impact on the environment.
HUMAN CAPITAL
The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop talent to deliver on the Company’s strategy. To support these objectives, the Company’s human capital programs are designed to: keep people safe and healthy; develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions; and facilitate internal talent mobility.

EMPLOYEES
At December 31, 2021, the Company employed approximately 7,500 people worldwide, including approximately 4,400 located outside the United States. 
At December 31, 2021, the employees at each of the Company's Bryan, Ohio; Freeport, Illinois; and Des Moines, Iowa facilities, which collectively account for approximately 63% of the Company’s U.S. employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements. By January 12, 2022, the employees represented by the United Steelworkers at each of the Company’s Bryan, Ohio; Freeport, Illinois; and Des Moines, Iowa facilities voted to ratify new three year contracts which expire on November 16, 2024.
Outside the United States, the Company enters into employment agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements generally correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. 
COMPETITION
The Company competes with several domestic and international companies, some of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than Titan.  The Company believes it is a primary source of steel wheels to the majority of its North 
American customers.  Major competitors in the off-highway wheel market include Accuride, Gianetti, GKN Wheels, Ltd., Jantsa, Maxin, Pronar, Rimex, Trelleborg Group, Topy Industries, Ltd and Wheels India Limited.  Significant competitors in the off-highway tire market include Alliance Tire Company Ltd., Balkrishna Industries Limited (BKT), Bridgestone/Firestone, Michelin, Mitas a.s., and Pirelli. Significant competitors in the undercarriage market include Berco and Caterpillar.

The Company competes on the basis of price, quality, sales support, customer service, design capability, and delivery time.  The Company's position of manufacturing both the wheel and the tire allows Titan to provide innovative assembly solutions for our customers, creating a competitive advantage in the marketplace. The Company’s ability to compete with international competitors may be adversely affected by various factors, including currency fluctuations and tariffs imposed by domestic and foreign governments.  Titan owns the molds and dies used to produce its wheels and tires. However, certain of the Company’s OEM customers could elect to manufacture their own products to meet their requirements or to otherwise compete with the Company.  The Company may be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates, or competitors developing products that are more effective, less expensive, or otherwise rendering certain of Titan’s products less competitive.  From time to time, certain of the Company’s competitors have reduced their prices in particular product categories, which has prompted Titan to reduce prices as well.  There can be no assurance that competitors of the Company will not further reduce prices in the future or that any such reductions would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
OPERATIONS
Titan’s operations include manufacturing wheels, manufacturing tires, combining these wheels and tires into assemblies, and manufacturing undercarriage systems and components for use in the agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer markets.  These operations entail many manufacturing processes in order to complete the finished products.
•Wheel Manufacturing Process
Most agricultural wheels are produced using a rim and a center disc. A rim is produced by first cutting large steel sheets to required width and length specifications. These steel sections are rolled and welded to form a circular rim, which is flared and formed in the rollform operation. The majority of discs are manufactured using presses that both blank and form the center to specifications in multiple stage operations. The Company e-coats wheels using a multi-step process prior to the final paint top coating.

Large earthmoving/construction steel wheels are manufactured from hot and cold-rolled steel sections. Hot-rolled sections are generally used to increase cross section thickness in high stress areas of large diameter wheels. A special cold forming process for certain wheels is used to increase cross section thickness while reducing the number of wheel components. Rims are built from a series of hoops that are welded together to form a rim base. The complete rim base is made from either three or five separate parts that lock together after the rubber tire has been fitted to the wheel, the parts have been fully assembled, and the assembly inflated.

For most wheels in our consumer segment, the Company manufactures rims and center discs from rolled and flat steel. Rims are rolled and welded, and discs are stamped and formed from the sheets. The manufacturing process then entails welding the rims to the centers and painting the assembled product.
•Tire Manufacturing Process
The first stage in tire production is the mixing of rubber, carbon black, and chemicals to form various rubber compounds. These rubber compounds are then extruded and processed with textile or steel materials to make specific components. These components – beads (wire bundles that anchor the tire with the wheel), plies (layers of fabric that give the tire strength), belts (fabric or steel fabric wrapped under the tread in some tires), tread, and sidewall – are then assembled into an uncured tire carcass. The uncured carcass is placed into a press that molds and vulcanizes the carcass under set time, temperature, and pressure into a finished tire.
•Wheel and Tire Assemblies
The Company’s position as a manufacturer of both wheels and tires allows Titan to mount and deliver one of the largest selections of off-highway assemblies in North America. Titan offers this value-added service of one-stop solution for wheel and tire assemblies for the agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer segments. Both standard and LSW assemblies are delivered as a single, complete unit based on each customer’s specific requirements.
•Undercarriage Manufacturing Process
The undercarriage components (track groups, track and carrier rollers, idler assemblies, and sprockets) are all manufactured from steel and produced according to the Company's specifications or if requested alternatively according to customer specification.
All tractor type track groups (up to 250 ton class) produced by the Company are built from five major parts: shoes, right and left hand links, pins, bushings and bolts and nuts. Shoes are manufactured from different shapes of hot rolled profiles (depending on application), sheared to length, and then heat treated for high wear bending and breaking resistance. Alternatively tailormade special shaped shoes are obtained from heat treated steel cast in the Company foundry. Right and left hand links are die forged, hot trimmed, mass heat treated, machined, and finally induction hardened on rail surface for optimal wear and fatigue resistance. Pins are made from round bars that are cut, machined, heat treated, and surface finished. Bushings are generally cold extruded, machined, mass heat treated, and finally carburized or induction hardened or through hardened for wear resistance and optimal toughness. All monobloc type track groups (250 ton class up) are high alloyed heavy castings, heat treated, induction hardened and machined to purpose in the Company foundry. 

The lifetime lubricated and maintenance-free track and carrier rollers are assembled with three major components: single or double flange roller shells (typically hot forged in halves, deep hardened, friction or arc welded, and finish machined with metallurgical characteristics depending upon size and application), shafts (generally cut from bars or forged, mass heat treated, rough machined, induction hardened, and ground) and casted brackets to fit the rollers onto the machine. The sealing of the rollers is generally obtained by Duo Cone Steel seals. 

The idler assemblies are also lifetime lubricated, for virtually no maintenance. They are offered with cast (single web or hollow design) or fabricated shells, depending on size and application, and feature induction-hardened tread surfaces for optimal wear resistance. 

The sprockets, designed to transfer the machine driving loads from the final drive to the track, are produced cast or forged in several geometric options, depending upon size and application. They are also heat treated for wear resistance and cracking resistance.

The undercarriage systems, custom designed and produced by the Company, consist of a structured steel fabricated frame, all the undercarriage components mentioned above (track groups, track and carrier rollers, idler assemblies, and sprockets) and a final drive. They are completely assembled in house, for consistent quality. 
•Quality Control
The Company is ISO certified at all four main domestic manufacturing facilities located in Bryan, Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; Freeport, Illinois; and Quincy, Illinois, as well as the majority of its foreign manufacturing facilities.  The ISO series is a set of related and internationally recognized standards of management and quality assurance.  The standards specify guidelines for establishing, documenting, and maintaining a system to ensure quality.  The ISO certifications are a testament to Titan’s dedication to providing quality products for its customers.
•International Operations
The Company operates manufacturing facilities in Latin America, Europe and Russia. The Latin American, European and Russian operations accounted for 18%, 22%, and 5% of the Company's net sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 17%, 21% and 6% of net sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
RAW MATERIALS
Steel, natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, bead wire, and fabric are the primary raw materials used by the Company.  To help ensure a consistent steel supply, Titan purchases raw steel from various steel mills and maintains relationships with steel processors for steel preparation.  The Company is not dependent on any single producer for its steel supply; however, some components do have limited suppliers.  Rubber and other raw materials for tire manufacture represent some of the Company’s largest commodity expenses.  Titan has developed a procurement strategy and practice designed to mitigate price risk and lower cost. Titan buys rubber in markets where there are usually several sources of supply.  In addition to the development of key domestic suppliers, the Company’s strategic procurement plan includes international steel and rubber suppliers to assure competitive price and quality in the global marketplace.  As is customary in the industry, the Company does not have long-term contracts for the purchase of steel or rubber and, therefore, purchases are subject to price fluctuations. 
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND ENGINEERING
The Company’s research, development, and engineering staff tests original designs and technologies and develops new manufacturing methods to improve product performance.  Titan’s engineering and manufacturing resources are focused on designing quality products that address the needs of our customers and end-users across the markets that Titan serves.  Titan’s team of experienced engineers continuously work on new and improved engineered solutions that evolve with today’s applications for the off-highway wheel, tire, and assembly markets. As a part of the design process, Titan seeks to be stewards of the environment through the adoption of eco-design principles, life cycle assessments, and evaluation of incorporating the use of recycled material and alternate environmentally friendly and sustainable raw materials where possible. Titan's advantage as both a wheel and tire manufacturer allows the Company to design, test, and bring to market innovative solutions to meet the specific needs of its customers. For example, Titan has developed the LSW technology, featuring a larger rim diameter and a smaller sidewall than standard tires, which helps reduce power hop, road lope, soil compaction, and provides improved safety and performance. Research and development (R&D) expenses are expensed as incurred.  R&D costs were $10.1 million, $9.0 million, and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND ROYALTIES
The Company owns various patents and trademarks and continues to apply for patent protection for new products.  Due to the difficult nature of predicting the interpretation of patent laws, the Company cannot anticipate or predict any material adverse effect on its operations, cash flows, or financial condition to the extent the Company is unable to protect its patents or should the Company be found to be infringing others' patents.
The Company has trademark license agreements with The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company to manufacture and sell certain farm tires under the Goodyear name. These agreements cover sales in North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Russia, and other Commonwealth of Independent States countries. Each of these agreements is scheduled to expire in 2025. The Company also has a trademark license agreement with Goodyear to manufacture and sell certain non-farm tire products in Latin America under the Goodyear name. The trademark license between the Company and The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, relating to the manufacture and sale of bias truck tires in Brazil, Mexico, Paraguay and Uruguay, was extended through December 31, 2022, and the country of Bolivia was deleted from that license.
CUSTOMERS
Titan’s 10 largest customers accounted for 40% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 35% for the year ended December 31, 2020.  Net sales to Deere & Company in Titan's agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer segments combined represented 12% and 11% of the Company's consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Titan's net sales in 2021 and 2020.  Management believes the Company is not dependent on any single customer; however, certain products are dependent on a few customers.  While the loss of any substantial customer could impact Titan’s business, the Company believes that its diverse product mix and customer base should minimize a longer-term impact caused by any such loss.
ORDER BACKLOG
The Company's backlog of orders is not considered material to, or a significant factor in, evaluating and understanding any of the Company's business segments or Titan's businesses considered as a whole.
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
The Company employs an internal sales force and utilizes several manufacturing representative firms for sales in North America, Europe, Latin America, the CIS region, and other worldwide locations.  Sales representatives are primarily organized within geographic regions.
Titan distributes wheels, tires, assemblies, and undercarriage systems directly to OEMs. The distribution of aftermarket tires occurs primarily through a network of independent and OEM-affiliated dealers.
SEASONALITY
Agricultural equipment sales are seasonal by nature.  Farmers generally order equipment to be delivered before the growing season.  Shipments to OEMs in the agricultural industry in the U.S. and Europe usually peak during the Company’s first and second quarters for the spring planting period, while shipments in Latin America usually peak during the Company's second and third quarters for the fall planting period.  Earthmoving/construction and consumer segments have historically experienced higher demand in the first and second quarters.  These segments are affected by mining, building, economic conditions and various global commodity prices.
LAWS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS
The Company's policy is to conduct its global operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements. In the ordinary course of business, similar to other industrial manufacturing companies, Titan is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state, local, and international environmental laws and regulations. From time to time, the Company has, and may in the future, incurred costs and additional charges associated with environmental compliance and cleanup projects, including remediation activities. As appropriate, the Company makes provisions for the estimated financial impact of potential environmental cleanup activities.  The Company’s policy is to accrue environmental cleanup-related costs of a non-capital nature when those costs are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Expenditures that extend the life of the related property, or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination, are capitalized. The Company does not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.  The quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors, including changing laws and regulations, advances in environmental technologies, the quality of information available related to specific sites, the assessment stage of the site investigation, preliminary findings, and the length of time involved in remediation or settlement.  Due to the difficult nature of predicting future environmental costs, the Company may not be able to anticipate or predict with certainty the potential material adverse effect on its operations, cash flows, or financial condition as a result of efforts to comply with, or any future liability under, environmental laws, regulations or other requirements.

 ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS
The Company is subject to various risks and uncertainties that it believes are significant to our business. These risks relate to or arise out of the nature of the Company's business and overall business, economic, financial, legal, and other factors or conditions that may affect the Company. In addition to risks discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are factors that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the Company's actual results to differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. In addition, other risks not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. It is impossible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of all risks or uncertainties that may impact the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.
Supplier and Raw Material Exposure
•The Company is exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities.
The Company uses various raw materials, most significantly steel, natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, bead wire, and fabric in manufacturing its products across all of its market segments. The Company does not generally enter into long-term commodity contracts and does not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge exposures to 
commodity market price fluctuations.  Therefore, the Company is exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities.   In addition, our business is susceptible to increases in other costs such as energy and natural gas prices to run our operating facilities as a result of factors beyond our control, including unfavorable weather conditions. Although the Company attempts to pass on certain material price and other cost increases to its customers, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so in the future.  Any increase in the price of steel and rubber that is not passed on to customers could result in declining margins and have a material adverse effect on Titan’s financial condition and results of operations.

•Demand for global logistical services, including container shortages, can negatively impact the cost of delivery to the end customer and unexpected delays in meeting delivery requirements to the end customer.
The Company uses various logistical providers and transportation methods including containers to transport its products to the end customers. The overall demand for containers depends largely on the rate of world trade and economic growth. During 2021 and continuing into the first quarter of 2022, the global economy has experienced a surge in demand worldwide for logistical services which has resulted in a global shortage of shipping containers, congested seaports and capacity constraints on vessels, among other challenges. The Company is exposed to significant price fluctuations on global shipping costs as well as uncertainty in terms of shipping delays as a result of the container demand and shortages. While the Company does attempt to pass on certain shipping and delivery related charges to its customer, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so into the future which could result in declining margins and have a material adverse effect on Titan's financial condition and results of operations.
•The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers.
The Company currently relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain key commodities, which consist primarily of steel and rubber, in the manufacturing of Titan products.  If the Company’s suppliers are unable to provide raw materials to Titan in a timely manner, or are unable to meet our quality, quantity or cost requirements, the Company may not in all cases be able to promptly obtain substitute sources. Any extended delay in receiving critical materials could impair Titan’s ability to deliver products to its customers. The loss of key suppliers, the inability to establish relationships with replacement suppliers, or the inability of Titan's suppliers to meet price, quality, quantity, and delivery requirements could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations.
•The Company has international operations and purchases raw material from foreign suppliers
The Company had total aggregate net sales outside the United States of approximately $944.2 million, $675.9 million, and $776.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Net sales outside the United States are a significant proportion of total net sales, accounting for 53%, 54% and 54% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Net sales from these international operations are expected to continue to represent a similar portion of total net sales for the foreseeable future.
International Operations and Sales – International operations and sales are subject to a number of risks and restrictions, that are not generally applicable to Titan’s North American operations including, but not limited to, risks with respect to currency exchange rates, economic and political destabilization, other disruption of foreign markets, restrictive actions by foreign governments (such as restrictions on transfer of funds, export duties, and quotas and foreign customs) and local epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19.  Other risks include changes in foreign laws regarding trade and investment; difficulties in establishing and maintaining relationships with respect to product distribution and support; nationalization; reforms of United States laws and policies affecting trade, restrictions on foreign investment, and restrictions on loans to foreign entities; and changes in foreign tax and other laws.  There may also be restrictions on the Company's ability to repatriate earnings and investments from international operations. There can be no assurance that one or a combination of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to increase or maintain its international sales and results of operations.

Foreign Suppliers – The Company purchases raw materials from foreign suppliers.  The production costs, profit margins, and competitive position of the Company are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where Titan purchases goods, relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where the products are sold.  The Company’s results of operations, cash flows, and financial position may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies.
Industry and Customer Base
•The Company operates in cyclical industries and is subject to changes in the economy.
The Company's sales are substantially dependent on three major industries: agricultural equipment, earthmoving/construction equipment, and consumer products.  The business activity levels in these industries are subject to specific 
industry and general economic cycles.  Any downturn in these industries or the general economy could drive decreases in demand for Titan’s products and have a material adverse effect on Titan’s business.

The agricultural equipment industry is affected by crop prices, farm income and farmland values, weather, export markets, and government policies. The earthmoving/construction industry is affected by the levels of government and private construction spending and replacement demand. The mining industry, which is within the earthmoving/construction industry, is affected by raw material commodity prices. The consumer products industry is affected by consumer disposable income, weather, competitive pricing, energy prices, and consumer attitudes. In addition, the performance of these industries is sensitive to interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes and varies with the overall level of economic activity. The cyclical and volatile nature of the industries on which our sales are substantially dependent results in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over the business cycle.
•The Company’s revenues are seasonal in nature due to Titan’s dependence on seasonal industries.
The agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer markets are seasonal, with typically lower sales during the second half of the year. This seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in the Company’s revenues and operating results between the first half and the second half of the year.  Because much of Titan’s overhead expenses are fixed, seasonal trends can cause volatility in profit margins and Titan's financial condition, especially during slower periods. 
•The Company’s customer base is relatively concentrated.
The Company’s ten largest customers, which are primarily original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), accounted for 40% and 35% of Titan’s net sales for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net sales to Deere & Company represented 12% and 11% of Titan’s net sales for 2021 and 2020, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Titan's net sales in 2021 and 2020. Titan’s business could be adversely affected if one of its larger customers reduces, or otherwise eliminates in full, its purchases from Titan due to work stoppages or slow-downs, financial difficulties, as a result of termination provisions, competitive pricing, or other reasons.  There is also continuing pressure from OEMs to reduce costs, including the cost of products and services purchased from outside suppliers such as Titan, and in that regard OEMs may develop in-house tire and wheel capabilities.  There can be no assurance that Titan will be able to maintain its long-term relationships with its major customers which could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.
•The Company faces substantial competition from domestic and international companies.
The Company competes with several domestic and international competitors, some of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than Titan.  Titan competes on the basis of price, quality, sales support, customer service, design capability, and delivery time.  The Company’s ability to compete with international competitors may be adversely affected by various factors including, currency fluctuations and tariffs imposed by domestic and foreign governments. In addition, certain OEM customers could elect to manufacture certain products to meet their own requirements or to otherwise compete with Titan. The success of the Company's business depends in large part on its ability to provide comprehensive wheel and tire assemblies to its customers. The development or enhancement by Titan's competitors of similar capabilities could adversely affect its business.
There can be no assurance that Titan’s businesses will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the Company’s markets, or that competitors will not develop products that are more effective or less expensive than Titan products or which could render certain products less competitive.  From time to time certain competitors have reduced prices in particular product categories, which has caused Titan to reduce prices. There can be no assurance that in the future Titan’s competitors will not further reduce prices or that any such reductions would not have a material adverse effect on Titan’s business.
•The Company could be negatively impacted if Titan fails to maintain satisfactory labor relations.
Titan is party to collective bargaining agreements covering a portion of the Company's workforce. Titan is exposed to risks associated with disruptions to the Company’s operations if the Company is unable to reach a mutually agreeable domestic collective bargaining agreement. The current domestic collective bargaining agreement was ratified in January 2022 and will expire on November 16, 2024. If Titan is unable to maintain satisfactory labor relations with its employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, these employees could engage in strikes, or the Company may otherwise experience work slowdowns or be subject to other labor actions. Any such actions, and any other labor disputes with the Company’s employees domestically or internationally, could materially disrupt its operations. Future collective bargaining agreements may impose significant additional costs on Titan, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.
Liquidity
•The Company’s revolving credit facility and other debt obligations contain covenants that could limit the Company's financial and operational flexibility.
The Company’s revolving credit facility, the indenture relating to the Company’s 7.00% senior secured notes due 2028 and other debt obligations contain covenants and restrictions that may impact the Company’s business. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Restrictions” below for a further discussion of these covenants and restrictions. A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could limit Titan’s ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital investments, to raise additional debt or equity capital, to pay dividends, or to take advantage of business opportunities, including future acquisitions. Titan’s ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions.
International
•The Company may be affected by unfair trade.
Titan faces intense competition from producers both in the United States and around the world, some of which may engage in unfair trade practices.  For example, in early January 2016, Titan, along with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Worker International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) alleging that imported off-the-road tires from India and Sri Lanka and wheel and tire assemblies from China were being dumped and/or subsidized and were a cause of material injury to the domestic industry. Unfair trade may have a material adverse effect on Titan's business.
•The Company may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies.
Domestic and foreign political developments and government regulations and policies directly affect the agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer products industries in the United States and abroad. Regulations and policies in the agricultural industry such as those concerning greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and ongoing U.S. budget issues could negatively impact the Company's business. The earthmoving/construction industry is affected by changes in construction activity, housing starts, and other regulations related to the mining and the construction of roads, bridges, and infrastructure. The modification or adoption of existing laws, regulations, or policies could have an adverse effect on any one or more of these industries and, therefore, on Titan’s business.
The United Kingdom (UK) officially withdrew from the EU (Brexit) on December 31, 2020. There is uncertainty as to the scope, nature and terms of the relationship between the UK and the EU after the Brexit Transition Period. This uncertainty could adversely impact customer or investor confidence, result in additional market volatility, legal uncertainty and divergent national laws and regulations. 
In February 2022, in response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United States, other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, as well as non-member states, have announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia, certain Russian citizens and enterprises. The continuation of the conflict may trigger a series of additional economic and other sanctions enacted by the United States, other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, and other countries. The potential impact of bans, sanction programs, and boycotts on our business is uncertain at the current time due to the fluid nature of the military conflict as it is unfolding. The potential impacts include supply chain and logistics disruptions, financial impacts including disruptions to the execution of banking transactions with certain Russian financial institutions, volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, inflationary pressures on raw materials and energy, heightened cybersecurity threats and other restrictions.
As the Company maintains operations in Russia, any such economic sanctions may also result in an adverse effect on its Russian operations. The Company currently owns 64.3% of the Russian entity, which represents approximately 7% of consolidated assets of Titan as of December 31, 2021. The Russian operations represents approximately 6% of consolidated global sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the impact of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has not had a significant impact on global operations. The Company continues to monitor the potential impacts on the business and the ancillary impacts that the war could have on other global operations.

Legal and Compliance 
•Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings could adversely affect Titan's results of operations.
The Company is a party to routine legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business.  Due to the difficult nature of predicting unresolved and future legal claims, the Company cannot anticipate or predict any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of efforts to comply with, or its liabilities pertaining to, legal judgments. Any adverse outcome in any litigation involving Titan or any of its subsidiaries could negatively affect the Company's business, reputation, and financial condition.

•The Company is subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations.
The Company has international operations and must comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA prohibits these payments regardless of local customs and practices. Safeguards that Titan may implement to discourage these practices could prove to be ineffective, and violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions or other liabilities or proceedings against Titan and could adversely affect the Company's business and reputation. 
•The Company may be subject to product liability and warranty claims.
The Company warrants its products to be free of certain defects and, accordingly, may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to product liability or product warranty claims.  Losses may result or be alleged to result from defects in Titan products, which could subject the Company to claims for damages, including consequential damages.  There can be no assurance that the Company's insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that adequate insurance will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. Any claims relating to defective products that result in liability exceeding Titan’s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on Titan's financial condition and results of operations. Further, claims of defects could result in negative publicity against Titan, which could adversely affect the Company’s business and reputation.
•The Company is subject to risks associated with climate change regulations.
Governmental regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries have adopted, or are contemplating introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change.  Laws and regulations regarding climate change and energy usage may impact the Company directly through higher costs for energy and raw materials.  The Company’s customers may also be affected by climate change regulations that may impact future purchases of the Company's products.  Physical climate change may potentially have a large impact on the Company’s two largest industry segments, agriculture and earthmoving/construction.  The potential impacts of climate change and climate change regulations are highly uncertain at this time, and the Company cannot anticipate or predict any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of climate change and climate change regulations.

•The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations.
The Company’s operations are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste and other materials.  The Company’s operations entail risks in these areas, and there can be no assurance that Titan will not incur material costs or liabilities, including in connection with complying with the laws and regulations and any required remediation.  In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations, or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Titan’s customers may also be affected by environmental laws and regulations that may impact future purchases of the Company's products. 

•The Company is subject to corporate governance requirements, and costs related to compliance with, or failure to comply with, existing and future requirements could adversely affect Titan’s business.
The Company is subject to corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). These laws, rules, and regulations continue to evolve and may become increasingly restrictive in the future. Failure to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations may have a material adverse effect on Titan’s reputation, financial condition, and the value of the Company’s securities.
•The Company is subject to risks associated with maintaining adequate disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting.
Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could affect the accuracy and timing of the Company's financial reporting. Testing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosures involves significant costs and could divert management's attention from other matters that are important to Titan's business. If the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes, and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, the Company may be otherwise unable to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the listing of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE could be suspended or terminated, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the confidence in the Company's financial reporting, its credibility in the marketplace, and the trading price of Titan's common stock. 
Information Technology and Data Protection 
•The Company may be adversely affected by a disruption in, or failure of, information technology systems.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies upon information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. Technology systems are used in a variety of business processes and activities, including purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and financial reporting. The Company utilizes security measures and business continuity plans to prevent, detect, and remediate damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access (whether through cybersecurity attacks or otherwise), utility failures, and other similar disruptions. Despite Titan's security measures and safeguards, a security breach or information technology system interruption or failure may disrupt and affect the Company's business, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, potential legal claims and adversely affect Titan’s results of operations and financial conditions. There can be no assurance that any such security measures or plans will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to Titan's systems, networks, and information. Further a significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer or employee information could adversely impact the Company's reputation and could result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, significant costs, fines, and litigation, including with respect to enhanced cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. The Company is currently undergoing upgrades and improvements to its core enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems which are ‘cloud based’. Despite adequate security measures, these systems are vulnerable to disruption of service and security breaches as mentioned above. Further, investment in the ‘cloud based’ systems may have an adverse impact on short-term results of operations and financial condition. 
•The Company is subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection.
The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Titan collects personally identifiable information (PII) and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, Canada, and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction that are more restrictive than those in the U.S. Additionally, in 2016, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to the Company or Company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business.
General 
•The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely affect, the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.
COVID-19 has spread to all of the countries in which we operate. This has significantly impacted our workforce and our operations, including as a result of government mandates in certain countries to work from home to minimize the spread of the virus. In some of the countries where the Company has operations and where COVID-19 has been widespread (such as the Company’s European and Latin America locations), the Company’s operations were curtailed during portions of 2020, and to a certain extent continue today. Certain geographies (particularly Australia, Europe and Latin America) may continue to remain impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to new and emerging variants of COVID-19 resulting in higher employee absenteeism. Further, global supply chains are experiencing significant constraints as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including availability and pricing of raw materials, transportation and labor. The current constraints on the global supply chains are adding further complexity in the 
improvement to growth expectations in the near term. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our ability to conduct business and has affected the Company's operational and financial performance. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable disruption in the demand for our products in our end-markets.
•The Company is subject to foreign currency translation risk.
The Company operates in many worldwide locations and transacts business in many foreign currencies. Titan's financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars with financial statements of international subsidiaries being initially recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. dollars. Large fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other global currencies may have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
•The Company may incur additional tax expense or tax exposure.
The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and has domestic and international tax liabilities which are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Titan's income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws and regulations.  
•The Company is subject to risks related to uncertainties in global and regional economic conditions.
Our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally, regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our products tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
•The Company is not insured against all potential losses and could be harmed by natural disasters, catastrophes, or sabotage.
The Company's business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and products are produced at a limited number of locations. These facilities could be materially damaged, including as a result of natural disasters, such as fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes, or by sabotage. The Company could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, as well as damage to its reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity and efficiency, which could have a material adverse impact on Titan's business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
•Acquisitions/divestitures may require significant resources and/or result in significant losses, costs, or liabilities. 
Any future acquisitions or divestitures will depend on the Company’s ability to identify suitable opportunities, to negotiate acceptable terms, and to finance acquisitions. Titan will also face competition for suitable acquisition candidates, which may increase costs. In addition, acquisitions and divestitures require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from current operations. Furthermore, acquisitions and divestitures of businesses or facilities entail a number of additional risks and challenges including: integrating acquisitions with existing operations; and separating operations in connection with dispositions; applying internal controls and processes throughout the acquired business; potential disruption of the Company's ongoing business; inability to maintain key customer, supplier, and employee relationships; potential that transactions do not produce satisfactory returns on a timely basis or at all; and exposure to unanticipated liabilities.

International acquisitions or divestitures may be more complex and time consuming. Also, international acquisitions and divestitures may include a number of additional risks, including the integration of acquisitions or separation of divestitures in compliance with foreign laws and regulations and business and accounting systems.

Subject to the terms of its existing indebtedness, the Company may finance future acquisitions with cash from operations, additional indebtedness, and/or by issuing additional equity securities.  These commitments may impair the operation of Titan’s businesses.  In addition, the Company could face financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness, such as reducing liquidity and access to financing markets and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service such indebtedness.
