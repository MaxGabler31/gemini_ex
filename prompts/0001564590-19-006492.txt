Business Segments
 Our business is organized into three operating segments: Literacy, E&E Language, and Consumer Language. The Literacy segment derives revenue under a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model from the sales of literacy solutions to educational institutions serving grades K through 12. The E&E Language segment derives language-learning revenues from sales to educational institutions, corporations, and government agencies worldwide under a SaaS model. The Consumer Language segment derives revenue from sales to individuals and retail partners worldwide and recently completed a SaaS migration from a packaged software business. For additional information regarding our segments, see Note 18 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Prior periods are presented consistently with our current operating segments and definition of segment contribution.

Administrators can use these tools to access real-time dynamic reports and identify each learner's strengths and weaknesses.

Our team works directly with customers to plan, deploy, and promote the program for each organization, incorporate learning goals into implementation models, prepare and motivate learners, and integrate the E&E Language and Literacy solutions into technical infrastructure.
 Consumer Language:
 Rosetta Stone also offers a broad portfolio of technology-based learning products for personal use to the global consumer. Our interactive portfolio of language-learning solutions is powered by our widely recognized brand, and building on our more than 25-year heritage in language-learning.
 Many of our consumer products and services are available in flexible and convenient formats for tablets and smartphones. Our mobile apps enable learners to continue their lessons on the go and extend the learning experience away from a computer. Progress is automatically synchronized across devices to meet our customers' lifestyles. These apps may be available for download through the Apple App Store, Google Play, Amazon App Store for Android and Samsung Galaxy App Store.
 Rosetta Stone Language-Learning Solutions: Rosetta Stone provides intuitive, easy-to-use language-learning programs that can be purchased primarily as a software subscription via the web, mobile in-app purchase, or through retail channels.
 Our language-learning suite offers courses and practice applications in multiple languages, each leveraging our proprietary immersion methodology, speech recognition engine and innovative technology features. Beginner to intermediate language-learning products are available in 30 languages to build fundamental language skills. More advanced language-learning products are available in 9 of the 30 languages. We also offer online services to enhance and augment our learners' capabilities. Our Online Tutoring is an online video service that provides either one-on-one or group conversational coaching sessions with native speakers to practice skills and experience direct interactive dialogue. Our current suite of mobile language-learning apps includes companions to our computer-based language-learning apps which enables learners to access their language program anytime anywhere.
 Software Development:
 Our offering portfolio is a result of significant investment in software development. Our software development efforts include the design and build of software solutions across a variety of devices, pedagogy and curriculum development, and the creation of learning content. Our development teams build new solutions and enhance or maintain existing solutions. We have specific expertise in speech recognition technology, iterative and customer-focused software development, instructional design, and language acquisition. We continue to evaluate changes to our solutions to strengthen our brand and improve the relevance of our offering portfolio.
Customers and Distribution Channels
 No customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Most of our business is SaaS based; consequently, backlog is not significant.

Literacy:
 Our Literacy distribution channel in the United States utilizes a direct sales force as well as relationships with third-party resellers focused on the sale of Lexia solutions to K-12 schools. International distribution is primarily managed through independent resellers based in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.
 E&E Language:
 Our E&E Language distribution channel is focused on targeted sales activity primarily through a direct sales force in five markets: K-12 schools, colleges and universities, government agencies, not-for-profit organizations, and corporations. Our E&E Language-learning customers include the following:
 Educational Institutions.   These customers include primary and secondary schools and colleges and universities.
 Government Agencies and Not-for-Profit Organizations.   These customers include government agencies and organizations developing workforces that serve non-native speaking populations, offering literacy programs, and preparing members for overseas missions.
 Corporations.   We promote interest in this market with onsite visits, trade show and seminar attendance, speaking engagements, and direct mailings.
 Third-party Resellers and Partners. We utilize third-party resellers and partners to provide our language-learning solutions to businesses, schools, and public-sector organizations in markets predominantly outside the U.S.
 As part of our K-12 customer activities, our Literacy and E&E Language segments interact with employees of school districts including superintendents, procurement officers, principals and teachers. For instance, we participate in associations and events, including as a sponsor, at which such employees are present. We also invite these employees to events hosted by us, at which we discuss general educational developments as well as our products and services, and to serve on customer advisory boards to provide feedback on our products and services. We sometimes, and as permissible, pay the travel expenses of school district employees who attend company-sponsored events or serve on an advisory board. 
 Consumer Language:
 Our Consumer Language distribution channel comprises a mix of our websites, third party e-commerce websites, app-stores, consignment distributors, select retailers, and call centers. We believe these channels complement each other, as consumers who have seen our direct-to-consumer advertising may purchase at our retailers, and vice versa.
 Direct to consumer (“DTC”).   Sales generated through our e-commerce website at www.rosettastone.com, app stores such as Google Play and Apple App Store and our call centers.
 Indirect to consumer. Sales generated through arrangements with third-party e-commerce websites and consignment distributors such as Software Packaging Associates.
 Retailers.   Our retailers enable us to provide additional points of contact to educate consumers about our solutions, expand our presence beyond our own websites, and further strengthen and enhance our brand image. Our retail relationships include Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, Target, Best Buy, Staples, and others in and outside of the U.S. We may also partner at times with daily deal and home shopping resellers.
 Home School.   We promote interest in the language-learning market through advertising in publications focused on home schooling and attending local trade shows.
 Sourcing and Fulfillment
 Consistent with the SaaS model in our Literacy and E&E Language segments, we have transitioned the Consumer Language segment away from CD-based product sales to a cloud-based software subscription in order to provide an improved learner experience with instant fulfillment and mobile availability, which has also allowed us to, over time, reduce costs associated with physical packaging and distribution. Consequently, physical inventory is not significant. 
 Our physical inventory utilizes a flexible and low-cost manufacturing base. We use a third-party logistics company to obtain substantially all of our packaging components, which primarily consist of boxes for our language learning product and audio practice products, and to manufacture and fulfill finished product. We believe that we have good relationships with our vendors and that there are alternative sources in the event that one or more of these vendors is not available. We continually review our manufacturing and supply needs against the capacity of our contract manufacturers and suppliers with a view to ensuring that we are able to meet our production goals, reduce costs and operate more efficiently.

Competition
 Rosetta Stone competes in several categories within the technology-based learning industry, including literacy, enterprise and educational language learning, and consumer language learning. With Lexia, we compete primarily in the K-12 digital literacy space in the U.S. The language-learning market is highly fragmented globally and consists of a variety of instructional and learning modes: classroom instruction utilizing the traditional approach of memorization, grammar and translation; immersion-based classroom instruction; self-study books, audio recordings and software that rely primarily on grammar and translation; and free online and mobile offerings that provide content and opportunities to practice writing and speaking. 
Seasonality
 Our business is affected by variations in seasonal trends. Within our Literacy segment and K-12 Language education sales channel, sales are seasonally stronger in the second and third quarters of the calendar year corresponding to the end and beginning of school district budget years. E&E Language segment sales in our government and corporate sales channels are seasonally stronger in the second half of the calendar year due to purchasing and budgeting cycles. Consumer Language sales are affected by seasonal trends associated with the holiday shopping season. In particular, we generate a large portion of our Consumer Language sales in the fourth quarter during the period beginning on Black Friday through the end of the calendar year.
 Our operating segments are affected by different sales-to-cash patterns. Consumer Language sales typically turn to cash more quickly than E&E Language and Literacy sales, which tend to have longer collection cycles. Historically, in the first half of the year we have been a net user of cash and in the second half of the year we have been a net generator of cash.
 Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property is critical to our success. We rely on a combination of measures to protect our intellectual property, including patents, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights and non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements. In certain circumstances, we may sub-license our intellectual property including our trademarks and software for use in certain markets.
We have sixteen U.S. patents, thirteen foreign patents and several U.S. and foreign patent applications pending that cover various aspects of our language-learning and literacy technologies.
 We have registered a variety of trademarks, including our primary or house marks, Rosetta Stone, The Blue Stone Logo, Lexia, Lexia PowerUP Literacy, TruAccent, and Catalyst. These trademarks are the subject of either registrations or pending applications in the U.S., as well as numerous countries worldwide where we do business. We have been issued trademark registrations for our yellow color from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks we use today and those we develop in the future. We believe that the distinctive marks that we use in connection with our solutions are important in building our brand image and distinguishing our offerings from those of our competitors. These marks are among our most valuable assets.
 In addition to our distinctive marks, we own numerous registered and unregistered copyrights, and trade dress rights, to our products and packaging. We intend to continue to strategically register copyrights in our various products. We also place significant value on our trade dress, which is the overall image and appearance of our products, as we believe that our trade dress helps to distinguish our products in the marketplace from our competitors.
 Since 2006, we have held a perpetual, irrevocable and worldwide license from the University of Colorado allowing us to use speech recognition technology for language-learning solutions. Since 2014, we have also held a commercial license from the Florida State University Research Foundation allowing us to use certain computer software and technology in our literacy offerings. These types of arrangements are often subject to royalty or license fees.
 We diligently protect our intellectual property through the use of patents, trademarks and copyrights and through enforcement efforts in litigation. We routinely monitor for potential infringement in the countries where we do business. In addition, our employees, contractors and other parties with access to our confidential information are required to sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,040 total employees, consisting of 723 full-time and 317 part-time employees. We have employees in France and Spain who benefit from a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
