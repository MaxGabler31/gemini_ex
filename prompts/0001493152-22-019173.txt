ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Our solutions focus on three major services areas, Data as a Service, which includes data collected by our Wave Adaptive Modular Vessel (WAM-V®) autonomous vehicles or our PowerBuoy® Product lines; Power as a Service, which includes our PowerBuoy® and Subsea battery products; and our Strategic Consulting Services.
 
We provide ocean data collection and reporting, marine power, offshore communications, and Maritime Domain Awareness (“MDA”) products and consulting services. We offer our products and services to a wide-range of customers, including those in government and offshore energy, oil and gas, construction, wind power and other industries. We are involved in the entire life cycle of product development, from product design through manufacturing, testing, deployment, maintenance and upgrades. working closely with partners across our supply chain. We also work closely with our third party partners that provide us with, among other things, software, controls, sensors, integration services, and marine installation services. Our solutions enable technologies for data collection, analysis, and communication in ocean and other offshore environments, and generate actionable intelligence via a variety of inputs. We then channel the information we collect, and other communications, through control equipment linked to edge computing and cloud hosting environments.
 
Our mission is to provide intelligent maritime solutions and services that enable more secure and more productive utilization of our oceans and waterways, provide clean energy power services, and offer sophisticated surface and subsea maritime domain awareness solutions. We achieve this through our proprietary, state-of-the-art technologies that are at the core of our clean and renewable energy platforms, and our solutions and services.
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in April 1984 and began commercial operations in 1994. On April 23, 2007, we reincorporated in Delaware.
 
Our Solutions
 
Data as a Service
 
Our Data as a Service solution is at the forefront of our strategic plan to be a leader in offshore data collection, integration, analytics and real time communication for a variety of important applications. For example, our solutions can track surface movement for maritime border enforcement, illegal fishing interdiction, provide security for offshore wind farms and oil and gas fields, or provide harbor or port security as well as logistics support. We have the ability to support aquaculture and gather information on ocean currents, water quality, wind and other weather metrics, and map shorelines or subsurface areas. Additionally, we offer 24/7 monitoring solutions that can provide meaningful real time information, and long term data collection and analytics for sophisticated applications across many industries and scientific applications.
 
As part of our Data as a Service division, in October 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Adams Communication & Engineering Technology, Inc. (“ACET”) to conduct a feasibility study for the evaluation of a PB3 power and 5G communications solution in support of the U.S. Navy’s Naval Postgraduate School’s Sea, Land, Air, Military Research Initiative (“SLAMR”).
 
Maritime Domain Awareness Solution (“MDAS”)
 
The International Maritime Organization defines Maritime Domain Awareness (“MDA”) as the effective understanding of any activity that could impact the security, safety, economy, or environment related to and within our oceans and seas. Since 2002, the United States of America has had an active strategy to secure the Maritime Domain, primarily through the U.S. Navy. Furthermore, in 2020 the U.S. Coast Guard elevated Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (“IUU”) fisheries, one aspect of MDA security, as the leading global maritime threat.

We have designed our solution to provide detailed, localized maritime domain awareness that can be utilized for a wide range of applications across market segments. Our MDAS base hardware consists of a high-definition radar, a stabilized high-definition optical and thermal imaging camera, and a vessel automatic identification system (“AIS”) detection module. This hardware can be customized or supplemented by other solutions, depending on our customer’s requirements, These devices are mounted on our products, such as our PB3 PowerBuoy® or WAM-V®, and then utilizing integrated command and control software, data is sent to us and to our customers via secure communications channels. Multiple sensors can be used on a single unit based on the comprehensiveness of customer needs. Capabilities of our MDAS include 24/7 vessel tracking, automatic radar plotting, automated vessel warnings, and high-definition optical and thermal video surveillance capable of providing actionable intelligence day or night, in real time.
 
We anticipate that data from our MDAS will be processed onboard our buoys or WAM-Vs using edge computing, transmitted to our cloud-based analytics platform via secure Wi-Fi, cellular, and/or satellite systems. Surveillance data can be integrated with third party marine monitoring software or with our own MDA software solution developed together with leading partners in the technology industry to provide command and control features of a multi-buoy surveillance network. This network can be coordinated with the use of our WAM-Vs so that customers can have mobile sensor networks linked to our self-powered buoy data and communication hubs. The data can also be integrated with satellite, weather, bathymetric, and other third party data feeds to form a detailed surface and subsea picture of a monitored area.
 
The development of a complete, integrated MDAS is still underway, however, we achieved a key milestone in October 2021, with the initiation of our offshore demonstration of the new system utilizing our hardware and TimeZero software off the coast of New Jersey. To date we have collected more than 2,000 radar and AIS tracks from this demonstration, which is being used to refine the design of our MDAS. Initial field demonstration of our MDAS software began in May 2022 and is ongoing.
 
Autonomous Vehicles (“WAM-V®”)
 
On November 15, 2021, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interest of Marine Advanced Robotics, Inc. (“MAR”). Founded in 2004, MAR is the developer of the patented Wave Adaptive Modular Vessel (WAM-V®) technology, which enables roaming capabilities for uncrewed maritime systems in waters around the world. MAR launched the first WAM-V® in 2007 as a new vessel class to deliver to customers reliable autonomous surface vehicles that could provide robust, real-time data collection and reporting. MAR also provides RaaS (Robotics as a Service) allowing customers to lease WAM-V® robotics and access information from our WAM-V’s while we maintain ownership and maintenance and repair responsibilities. Today, WAM-Vs® operate in 11 countries for commercial, military and scientific uses. Our WAM-Vs exist in three primary sizes, 8, 16, and 22 feet, however, many of the design components are common across the sizes, allowing for integration of different payloads and adaption of the payload platforms for larger equipment. All sizes can be adapted to suit different propulsion methods.
 
This acquisition immediately provided the Company with an established product line that highly complements the Company’s business strategy and can be used inshore, nearshore, and offshore. Since the acquisition, the business of MAR has continued to grow and is further expanding into its core marine survey and maritime security markets in Europe, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. As we continue to leverage MAR technology with OPT, we expect to expand on the synergistic opportunities we have identified. For example, we plan to integrate the MDAS platform onto the WAM-V® to expand our MDA offering to provide a roaming MDA solution to our customers.
 
Power as a Service
 
Power as a Service solutions deliver value to customers by utilizing our managed power platforms. We continue to develop and commercialize our proprietary power platforms that generate electricity primarily by harnessing the renewable energy of ocean waves for our PowerBuoy® (“PB3”), solar power for our hybrid PowerBuoy® (the “hybrid PB”) and have the option of adding small wind turbines to supplement power generation. We also continue to commercialize our subsea battery for topside and subsea power applications and as additional storage when combined with our buoy platforms. Our focus for these solutions is on bringing autonomous clean power to our customers wherever it is required. Moreover, offshore data and communications networks require power to function, and our solution solves for this need without requiring ongoing battery replacement or older technologies such as shore to station power cables.

PB3 PowerBuoy®
 
The PB3 uses proprietary technologies that convert the kinetic energy created by the motion of ocean waves into electricity. The PB3 features a unique onboard power take-off (“PTO”) system, which incorporates both energy storage and energy management and control systems. The PB3 generates a nominal nameplate capacity rating of up to 3 kilowatts (“kW”) of peak power during recharging of the onboard batteries. Power generation is deployment-site dependent, as wave activity impacts power generation. Our energy storage system (“ESS”) has a capacity of up to a nominal 150 kW-hours to meet specific application requirements.
 
The PB3 is designed to generate power for use independent of the power grid in offshore locations. The hull consists of a main spar structure compliantly moored to the seabed and surrounded by a floating annular structure that can freely move up and down in response to the passage of the waves. The PTO system includes a mechanical actuating system, an electrical generator, a power electronics system, our control system, and our ESS which is sealed within the hull. As ocean waves pass the PB3, the mechanical stroke action created by the rising and falling of the waves is converted into rotational mechanical energy by the PTO, which in turn, drives the electric generator. The power electronics system then conditions the electrical output which is collected within an ESS.
 
The operation of the PB3 is controlled by our customized, proprietary control system. The control system uses sensors and an onboard computer to continuously monitor the PB3 subsystems. We believe that this ability to optimize and manage the electric power output of the PB3 is a significant advantage of our technology. In the event of large storm waves, the control system automatically locks the PB3, and electricity generation is suspended. However, the load center (either the on-board payload or one in the vicinity of the PB3) may continue to receive power from the ESS. When wave heights return to normal operating conditions, the control system automatically unlocks the PB3 and electricity generation and ESS replenishment recommences. This safety feature helps to prevent the PB3 from being damaged by storms.
 
A single MDAS equipped PB3 can monitor vessel traffic, with or without AIS turned on, across a specific offshore area of interest, with the ability to utilize multiple surveillance assets together over large ocean areas giving end-users visibility into potentially damaging environmental or illegal activities. Customized solutions are also available including the addition of subsea sensors to monitor for acoustic signatures, tsunami activity, and water quality.
 
hybrid PowerBuoy®
 
The hybrid PowerBuoy® (“hybrid PB”) is an alternative platform to the PB3 capable of utilizing solar and wind power. The hybrid PB is capable of providing reliable power in remote offshore locations, regardless of ocean wave conditions. We believe this product is complementary to the PB3 as it addresses a broader spectrum of customer deployment needs, including low-wave and nearshore environments, with the potential for greater product integration within each customer project. The hybrid PB is intended to provide a stable energy platform for our MDAS solution, and for agile deployment of subsea power applications, such as a surface communications hub for electric remotely operated vehicles (“eROV”) and autonomous underwater vehicles (“AUV”) used for underwater inspections and short-term maintenance, and subsea equipment monitoring and control. The design has a high payload capacity for surveillance and communications equipment, with the capability of being tethered to subsea payloads such as batteries, or with a conventional anchor mooring system. Energy is stored in onboard lithium ion batteries which can power subsea and topside payloads. As with the PB3, the control system uses sensors and an onboard computer to continuously monitor the hybrid PB subsystems. The hybrid PB is designed to be able to operate over a broad range of temperature and ocean wave conditions. It has a 30kW-hour battery system and carries up to 1.2MW-hour energy when combined with the current onboard propane storage system. We are also developing another hybrid system with increased solar capacity and increased battery storage with the option of adding incremental wind turbine power generation, replacing the propane system.

Subsea Battery
 
Our subsea battery is complementary to both the PB3 and hybrid PB products and can be deployed together with our PowerBuoys® or as a standalone unit. It offers customers the option of placing additional modular and expandable energy storage on the seabed near existing, or to be installed, subsea equipment. Our pressure-tested lithium-ion phosphate subsea batteries supply power that can enable subsea equipment, sensors, communications and AUV and eROV recharge. Our PB3 and hybrid PB are complimentary to the subsea batteries by providing a means for recharging during longer term deployments, or the batteries can be used independently for shorter term deployments.
 
The subsea battery provides both long or short-term power supply from its integrated energy storage system, enabling us to supply into a range of industries and applications, from backup power to critical subsea infrastructure to continuous operation of subsea equipment, such as electric valves. The base design of the subsea battery has a nominal 100kW-hours of available energy storage and is designed to operate in a water depth of up to 500 meters. It comes installed on a ready deployable subsea skid suitable for installation on the seabed. The subsea battery can be integrated into other subsea equipment on land prior to deployment.
 
Strategic Consulting Services
 
The focus of our Strategic Consulting Services is on delivering value to our customers in the areas of ocean engineering, structural and dynamic analysis, Front End Engineering and Design (“FEED”) studies, and motion simulation. These services can be integrated in support of our broader Power and/or Data as a Service solutions, utilizing our products or on an independent basis for third party clients. In the near term, we will focus on increasing our market share in the offshore wind market, the broader floating foundation design market, as well as with our offshore energy customers.
 
We intend to continue to grow our service sectors and strengthen our solutions through internal developments, partnerships, and potential acquisitions. Our Strategic Consulting Services were materially expanded with the acquisition of 3dent Technology, LLC (“3Dent”), in February 2021. Our team of dedicated consultants/designers has expertise in structural engineering, hydrodynamics and naval architecture. Consulting services include simulation engineering, software engineering, concept design and motion analysis. We also offer a full range of high-level offshore engineering to offshore wind developers, offshore construction companies, drilling contractors, major oil companies, service companies, shipyards, and engineering firms. For example, we advise offshore drill rig owners, including owners of floaters, jackups, and lift boats. The Company saw an increase in consulting services activity for conventional offshore energy and for offshore wind projects in the second half of fiscal 2022.
 
Strategy and marketing
 
Our strategy includes developing integrated solutions and services, including autonomous and cloud-based delivery systems for ocean data and predictive analytics to provide actionable intelligence for our clients. We believe that having demonstrated the capability of our solutions, we can advance our product and services and gain further adoption from our target markets. Our marketing efforts are focused on offshore locations that require a cost-efficient solution for renewable, reliable, and persistent power, data collection, and communications, either by supplying electric power to payloads that are integrated directly with our products or located in its vicinity, such as on the surface, the seabed, or in the water column. Our recent projects have been in the offshore energy and science and research industries.
 
Based on our market research and publicly available data, including but not limited to the 2019 DOE Report: Exploring Opportunities for Marine Renewable Energy in Maritime Markets (the “Powering the Blue Economy Report”) Report, the Westwood Global Energy World ROV Operations Forecast 2019-2023, we believe there is an increasing need for our products and services in maritime domain awareness applications and numerous other markets.

Potential customers include, but are not limited to, defense and security, offshore oil and gas, science and research, and offshore wind markets, as well as government applications in border security, vessel tracking, fishery protection and monitoring of marine protected areas. For example, autonomously monitoring and surveying offshore wind farm lease areas would enable developers to collect data needed to support environmental impact studies with low carbon emissions. This could be done with buoys and vehicles.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
We continue to commercialize our current and future products and solutions by targeting customers in our principal markets (defense and security, offshore oil and gas, science and research, and offshore wind, as well as government applications in border protection, fishery protection and marine protected areas) that require resident, semi-resident, or roaming platforms. Our platforms provide stable and reliable power sources in nearshore and remote offshore locations for short and long-term deployments. We believe that our solutions and our existing commercial relationships provide the following competitive advantages in our target markets:

● | Numerous applications within multiple major market segments. We have designed our solutions to have multiple offshore applications that can be used globally by customers. Our WAM-V® autonomous vehicles are designed for inshore and offshore deployments as fully or semi-autonomous systems and can operate in force multiplier mode. Our vehicles can support customized subsea and surface payloads, including other remotely operated or autonomous systems such as aerial drones and remotely operated vehicles (“ROV’s”). Multiple applications exist in the hydrographic survey market, across a range of industries including offshore wind and oceanographic monitoring. Our PB3 is designed for longer-term deployment in moderate to high ocean wave climates. Our hybrid PB is designed to meet the needs of customers with projects in low sea state locations and/or those requiring shorter-term deployments. We believe our subsea battery enables persistent power to be delivered from the seabed to support autonomous, all-electric subsea operations. Together, all these products can be integrated to provide customized power solutions for our customers. Our PowerBuoy® platforms can also act as persistent or short term self-powered solution platforms for payloads, such as our MDA package which can provide real-time perimeter security, vessel tracking and area surveillance for government defense, fishery protection, and offshore energy applications.

● | Considerable life-cycle cost savings over current solutions for many applications. Our PB3 is designed to operate over extended intervals between required maintenance activities. We believe that our PB3 reduces costs over multi-year operations. These cost savings are mostly due to reduced vessel and personnel servicing activities. For short term deployments, our hybrid PB is a cost-efficient means of providing MDA and subsea power solutions. Our subsea battery can provide power to sea floor systems when combined with either the PB3 or hybrid for power regeneration, thus reducing or, in some cases, eliminating the need for manned vessels to replace or recharge expended subsea batteries during mission life. Our WAM-V® vehicles displace carbon and capital intensive manned vessels, enabling savings to be realized even during short term deployments. 
● | Real-time data communications. Our systems can be equipped with a variety of communications equipment, such as 5G, 4G LTE, satellite, VHF, and Wi-Fi, which enables the transmission of data on a frequent or near-continuous basis. We believe that more frequent data communication could enable an end-user to more quickly and proactively make data-driven decisions which could result in economic advantages. Real-time data communications are an essential component of our WAM-V® operations and our MDA payload, allowing continued autonomous remote monitoring of marine traffic. 
● | Modular and scalable designs. Our WAM-Vs® exist in three primary sizes, 8, 16, and 22 feet, and many of the design components are common across the sizes, allowing for integration of different payloads and adaption of the payload platforms for larger equipment. All sizes can be adapted to suit different propulsion methods. Our PB3 and hybrid PB are designed with a modular energy storage systems which allows us to tailor its configuration to specific application requirements, including expansion of energy storage capacity, potentially allowing for a more customized solution and potential cost savings for our customers. We believe that the modular design of our subsea battery enables clients to specify larger energy storage than would be possible with just buoys and have this placed at the seabed and near existing electric subsea equipment.

● | Integrated Designs. All of our products will be designed to operate with each other in mesh or array setups. We are commercializing our existing MDA payload to operate on WAM-Vs® and believe that future integration of docking stations for WAM-Vs® into our PowerBuoys® will provide additional solutions for our customers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Flexible electrical, mechanical and communication interfaces for sensors. The WAM-V®, PB3, and hybrid PB can be equipped with payloads, either mounted on or within the platforms, or tethered to the platforms. The PowerBuoys® have mechanical and electrical interfaces which allow for simplified integration of payloads, creating flexibility for the end-user. The stable platforms of the WAM-Vs® allow for a broad range of subsea and surface sensors and assets to be integrated. Flexible interfaces reduce cost through simplified integration and deployment. 
● | Reduced carbon emission, environmentally benign system design. Our PB3 emits no carbon during operation. We further believe that our PB3 does not present significant risks to marine life, nor does it emit pollutants, and therefore has minimal environmental impact. Our electric WAM-Vs® primary source of energy is from batteries, thus enabling zero emission operations. WAM-Vs® have been demonstrated as suitable for sensitive marine area operations due to their shallow draft and zero emission profile. 
● | Ocean and factory-tested technology. We have deployed more than 70 WAM-Vs® to date across the world for commercial customers and government agencies. Our WAM-Vs® are designed to operate in a broad range of oceanic conditions and regions. On-location maintenance is designed into the WAM-Vs®. Our PB3 is designed to be durable, with a three-year interval between required maintenance activities. The PB3 has maintained operational performance through hurricanes, tropical storms and North Sea winter storms and has been successfully deployed for several clients. The hybrid PB has been demonstrated in the Atlantic off the coast of New Jersey. The subsea battery has been pressure-tested to its design depth at the Deep Ocean Test Facility in Annapolis, Maryland. Further, we continue to focus on standardizing manufacturing and production testing procedures and work closely with our supply base to ensure production repeatability. 
● | Prior commercial relationships enabled the development of our technology. Our prior and existing relationships with a broad range of government agencies, including, inter alia, the U.S. Navy, U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”), U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and NOAA, and our prior and existing relationships with commercial entities have allowed us to further develop our solutions for a variety of needs in various industries. We believe these relationships have helped position us within the public and private sectors for future commercial opportunities, which we believe enhances our market visibility and attractiveness to our prospective customers. 
● | Domestic Supply Chain. Our strategy is to utilize domestic supply chain sources, when available, to improve operations and collaboration with our supply partners. We believe this strategy reduces some of our exposure to the global sourcing and supply chain uncertainties that exist in the current environment relating to the impact of COVID-19 as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our Target Markets
 
The Company takes a rigorous approach to market evaluation. Utilizing publicly available and purchased data, we evaluate total addressable market sizes. We apply screening criteria to narrow our focus within these markets and identify sub-segments and associated service addressable market sizes. These market evaluations are updated on an ongoing basis throughout the year and more formally twice annually in line with our financial calendar. In 2019 the DOE released the Powering the Blue Economy Report. The report described eight non-grid applications where renewable marine energy could provide consistent, reliable power. The identified marine energy applications are ocean observation, underwater vehicle charging, marine aquaculture, marine algae, seawater mining, seawater desalination, coastal resiliency and disaster recovery, and isolated communities. We have been focused on addressing the energy needs of many of these applications (e.g., ocean observation, underwater vehicle charging), and other offshore applications (e.g., maritime domain awareness, well monitoring and powering subsea equipment control systems).

Defense and Security
 
Our MDAS provides the ideal understanding of the global maritime domain impacting the defense and security markets by generating actionable intelligence from the sea. This modular, standalone solution can be deployed across multiple platforms and provides remote, autonomous monitoring that enables enforcement of maritime law in dangerous and remote ocean environments to improve safety at sea. Applications include port security, maritime border protection, and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing protection, among others. Using an integrated suite of monitoring components and data communications and analysis software, our MDAS can enable 24/7, real-time, unmanned offshore monitoring capabilities.
 
We believe that our PB3 is uniquely positioned to be used to provide power and communications for multiple applications within the defense and security markets. The PB3’s ability to power multiple payloads may be an attractive feature for these markets, as their systems can be easily integrated into other PowerBuoy® applications allowing their operation to be concealed. One example of an application for domestic and international defense departments and defense contractors includes forward deployed energy and communications outposts (which is a current U.S. Department of Defense program), both above and below sea surface, as indicated in the completed study for the U.S. Navy’s Naval Postgraduate School’s Sea, Land, Air, Military Research Initiative (“SLAMR”). PB3’s enabled with our MDAS provide actionable intelligence from 24/7/365 radar and AIS vessel tracking (including “dark vessels”), automatic notifications and vessel warnings, real-time visual and Infra-Red video surveillance, with an integrated command and control user interface. Other examples of applications include perimeter security, early detection and warning systems, remote sensing stations, high frequency radar, sonar, electro-optical and infrared sensors for maritime security, network communications systems, and unmanned underwater vehicle docking stations.
 
In addition, our WAM-V® is an ideal platform servicing multiple applications within the defense and security markets, including high value asset protection, marine domain awareness, security perimeter, mine counter measures and explosive ordinance disposal, anti-submarine warfare, and border security. Multiple WAM-V’s® can also autonomously work together to provide a security perimeter and coordinate to intercept suspicious vessels and provide valuable information before the threat gets near the protected asset. WAM-Vs® can coordinate to intercept suspicious vessels and provide valuable information before the threat gets near the protected asset. The portability of the WAM-V® provides quick relocation of the entire system by air, sea or ground and the scalability of the WAM-V® technology means that a common platform can be used for multiple missions with varying requirements. Our platforms and systems are designed to be operated in compliance with our customers’ and our internal cybersecurity standards and integrate with our customers’ command and control systems (“C2”). Additionally, we actively manage cybersecurity at the corporate level.
 
IUU fishing has become a global issue with both environmental and economic consequences. According to a report published in Science Advances by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in February 2020, it is estimated the global economic impact from illegal fishing to be as high as $50 billion. Most exclusive economic zone monitoring is done by offshore patrol vessels (“OPV”), which is one of the fastest growing naval product markets with over 1,200 OPVs in service currently. We believe that our autonomous surveillance solution, which can be combined with satellite imagery, from our WAM-V®, can deliver substantial economic impact to governments over incumbent solutions in securing remote fisheries and MPAs. In the USA specifically, IUU fishing is considered a major maritime threat by the Department of Homeland Security.

Offshore Oil and Gas
 
We believe the offshore oil and gas industry is undergoing a significant transformation as it continues to invest in new technologies that enable carbon reduction, cost savings, and the electrification and digitization of operations. There are over 10,000 offshore oil and gas platforms worldwide, including exploration, production, reservoir management, and sites pending decommissioning based on information from organizations such as the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and industry organizations and publications. Driven by the growing demand for electrification, we believe that we have opportunities to implement one or more PB3s at some of these sites to displace current power solutions or augment existing technologies. Customer feedback obtained through engineering studies with multiple oil and gas customers has helped identify target applications for the PB3 – namely, temporary power for fields experiencing umbilical degradation and subsea docking stations for future resident ROV/AUV applications for inspection, maintenance, and repair. In addition, according to a 2019 Rystad Energy report, Norway is estimated to have 40% of its oil and gas production from electrified fields by 2015, as well as a growing desire for decarbonization and autonomous operations. Similarly, the market for remote and autonomous charging of subsea assets, such as ROVs and AUVs, is rapidly taking shape. Based on various reports, other applications in the oil and gas market include providing power to unmanned platforms and area surveillance during decommissioning activities. Although estimates vary in these reports, they generally point towards more than 2,000 platforms (and corresponding wells) that need to be decommissioned over the next 10 years across the globe. We see this market materializing primarily in the North Sea and regions such as Brazil and Australia. Furthermore, there is an increasing market demand for providing interim power solutions for tie-backs where umbilicals are exhibiting failures. This is evidenced by the interest in the PB3 technology demonstrated by the DeepStar and Harbour Energy feasibility studies completed by us to evaluate the use of PB3s in this application. These studies have helped us further identify specific applications in which the PB3 can reliably provide interim power for fields experiencing umbilical degradation. In addition, we believe the survey capability afforded by our WAM-V’s® is perfectly suited to serve the survey needs of the oil and gas industry. WAM-V® stability produces excellent sonar data quality in higher sea conditions than comparably sized vessels and can be used as a force multiplier to existing manned assets or as the sole deployment tool. WAM-V’s® can be outfitted with various sonar solutions depending on requirements and identify any underwater obstacles or hazards.
Marine Charting
 
Since 2019, WAM-Vs have been used in support of nautical charting efforts for NOAA-backed projects in the Great Lakes and Western Alaska. WAM-V’s® are teamed up with crewed assets to provide a force multiplier capability when compared to a crewed assets. This capability improves the production efficiency of the project as well as lowers the overall carbon footprint.
Science and Research
 
The science and research market provides environmental intelligence to the entire ocean enterprise, which supports ocean measurement, observation and forecasting, and is an important provider of information to maritime commerce and the entire “blue economy.” Maritime commerce and the scientific community depend on information in areas such as meteorology, climate change, ocean currents, and biological processes to inform operations and development. These groups often require a power and communications solution in remote offshore locations. Additionally, the increased interest in protecting marine habitats offers opportunities to collaborate with governments and NGOs to monitor marine sanctuaries.
Offshore Wind and Other Markets
 
Opportunities also exist in other markets such as supporting offshore wind farm development and aquaculture. Based on an article in the 2021 edition of the Offshore Wind Market by the US Department of Energy, the US offshore wind energy and product development pipeline grew to a potential generating capacity of 35,324 megawatts in 2020.
 
The offshore wind fleet is forecast to grow 15-fold by 2040 and move further offshore with Europe alone connecting over 500 turbines in 2019. While these turbines develop significant power, there are opportunities pre-installation of the turbines to autonomously collect ocean data during the early stages and monitoring of marine habitats during construction. There are also opportunities to support ongoing survey work once wind farms are operational to mitigate carbon emissions and to provide communication stations for aerial drones providing maintenance materials. Furthermore, the U.S. recently approved the permits for the first major utility scale offshore wind farm. Providing wave power solutions to utility scale renewable developments offers an attractive proposition to support renewable power and autonomous operations. Our solutions can support aquaculture development with systems such as species escape tracking, effluent monitoring, and other water quality considerations.
 
Our WAM-V’s® are used to perform sonar surveys that support the marine infrastructure required for offshore wind development and installation. They can also assist during the planning and environmental permitting phase including metocean and environmental data and mammal tracking. We can also protect operations through Maritime Domain Awareness to monitor operations and vessel traffic and motion data analysis for predictive maintenance and safety.

We also provide offshore engineering, consulting, and design services for offshore wind, drilling contractors, defense contractors, construction yards, engineering firms, and oil and gas, wave energy, and marine construction and service companies including design review, forensic investigation, and expert witness services.
 
Business Strategy
 
During fiscal 2022, we advanced our marketing programs, products, and solutions. We have made progress in transitioning from an R&D focused organization to more robust commercialization efforts and we are moving further into the ocean data as a service market. We intend to build on these efforts by introducing additional processes and making investments in appropriate human capital to target potential customers more effectively from demand generation to close of contract. In addition we are focusing on customer care and service efforts to increase repeat business opportunities. This strategy was further enhanced by our acquisition of MAR in November 2021.
 
The majority of the Company’s potential customers are in areas of maritime domain awareness, hydrographic survey, and IUU fishing to support persistent surveillance. These are largely for customers in the United States where the end use may be both domestic and abroad. Further, the Company’s recent acquisition of MAR provides an unmanned surface vehicle platform for use in oil & gas, renewable energy, hydrographic survey, and security and defense markets largely in North America and Europe.
 
Historically, demonstration projects have been a requisite step towards broad solution deployment and revenues associated with specific applications like our New Jersey MDAS test array as part of our Data as a Service solution. A proposal phase typically lasts from three months to two years. During the demonstration project specification, negotiation and evaluation period, we are often subject to the prospective customer’s vendor qualification process, which entails substantial due diligence of the Company and its capabilities. Such demonstrations are often a required step prior to leasing and may include negotiation of standard terms and conditions. Many proposals contain provisions which would provide the option to purchase or lease of our PowerBuoy® or WAM-V® product upon successful conclusion of the demonstration project. The Company has successfully demonstrated the capabilities of many of its solutions on its own or in customers sponsored evaluation projects and remains focused on further demonstrations to build customer awareness and confidence and to drive sales.
 
The Company is pursuing a long-term growth strategy to expand its market value proposition while growing the Company’s revenue base. This strategy includes partnerships with leading companies and organizations in adjacent and complementary markets. We continue to develop our PowerBuoy® and WAM-V® products for use in offshore power, data acquisition, and real-time data communications applications, and in order to achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following business objectives:
 

● | Integrated turn-key solutions, purchases or leases. We believe our Data and Power as a Service solutions, together with our platforms, are well suited to enable uncrewed, autonomous (non-grid connected) offshore applications, such as topside and subsea surveillance and communications, subsea equipment monitoring, early warning systems platform, subsea power and buffering, and weather and climate data collection. We have investigated and realized market demand for some of these solutions and we intend to sell and/or lease our products to these markets as part of these broader integrated solutions. Additionally, we intend to provide services associated with our solution offerings such as paid engineering studies, value-added engineering, maintenance, remote monitoring and diagnostics, application engineering, planning, training, project management, and marine and logistics support required for our solution life cycle. We continue to increase our commercial capabilities through new hires in sales, engineering, product development, safety, and application support, and through engagement of expert market consultants in various geographies. As our MDAS development continues, we expect that this will also include data and cloud services.

● | Expand customer system solution offerings through new complementary products that enable shorter and more cost-efficient deployments. We are continuously improving our technology solutions. The hybrid PB is highly complementary to the PB3 by providing the Company with additional ways to address a broader spectrum of customer deployment needs, including low-wave environments, with the potential for greater system integration within each customer project. The hybrid PB is intended for deployments for which the PB3 is not optimal, including shorter term missions and low wave environments. In addition, we have future plans to integrate PB3 and WAM-V® capabilities, including the possibility of adding recharging capabilities to our PB3’s, and MDAS capabilities to our WAM-V’s®, thus extending our reach and providing both fixed and mobile MDAS offerings to our customers.

 | The Company has also finished the development of a subsea battery system that is complementary to the Company’s PowerBuoy® products. The subsea battery system offers the possibility of creating a sea floor energy storage solution for remote offshore operations. These subsea battery systems contain lithium-ion batteries, which provide high power density to supply power to subsea equipment, sensors, communications, and the recharging of AUVs and eROVs. Ideal for many remote offshore customer applications, these subsea battery systems are designed to be safe, high performance, cost-efficient, and quickly deployable.

 | Our WAM-V’s® are easily and economically shipped via land, air, or sea, and their modular design enables us to quickly reduce their size for storage or shipment. The optional folding features further reduces the footprint by as much as 75% and as a result, a 20’ container can hold four 16 foot WAM-V®s. To integrate our solutions and add roaming as an option or enhancement to our MDAS, we are advancing developments to further integrate MDAS into the WAM-V® platform and develop additional autonomy capabilities. 
● | Focus sales and marketing efforts in global markets. While we are marketing our products and services globally, we have focused on several key markets and applications, including U.S. and foreign defense and security applications with our MDAS offering; subsea power for oil and gas; and the hydrographic survey market in U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia with regard to our WAM-V’s®. We believe that each of these areas has demand for our solutions, sizable end market opportunities, and high levels of industrialization and economic development. We have an office in Houston, Texas that enables us to further support our customers and strengthen our dialogue with our solution partners. During fiscal 2022, we opened an office in Richmond, California through our acquisition of MAR. During fiscal 2022, we also further solidified our European footprint, concentrating on our North Sea resource. We are in active discussions with potential partners in North and South America, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia and West Africa. We are also participating in a global study for a major oil and gas operator to use our PowerBuoys® to help reduce their carbon footprint, with applications in Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, and APAC. 
● | Expand our relationships in key market areas through strategic partnerships and collaborations. We believe that strategic partners are an important part of expanding visibility to our products. Partnerships and collaborations can be used to improve the development of overall integrated solutions, create new market channels, expand commercial know-how and geographic footprint, and bolster our product delivery capabilities. We have formed such a relationship with several well-known groups, and we continue to seek other opportunities to collaborate with application experts from within our selected markets. These partnerships have helped us source services, such as installation expertise, and products, such as MDA enabling equipment, to meet our development and customer obligations. We have been actively pursuing additional opportunities to bring in-house skills, capabilities, and solutions that are complementary to our strategy and enable us to scale more quickly, including, for example, our acquisition of 3Dent and MAR. 
● | Partnering with fabrication, deployment and service support. In order to minimize our capital requirements as we scale our business, we intend to optimize and utilize state of the art fabrication, anchoring, mooring, cabling supply, and in some cases, deployment of our products and solutions. We believe this domestically distributed manufacturing and assembly approach enables us to focus on our core competencies and ensure a cost-effective product by leveraging a larger more established supply base. We continue to seek strategic partnerships regarding servicing of our products and solutions. 
● | Survey and security market applications. With the addition of our WAM-V® products, we are able to increase our ability to lease vehicles specifically to support shoreline and off-shore survey markets as well as security applications while integrating MDA into these solutions.

Marketing and Sales
 
We continue to enhance our marketing capabilities across our target markets, and we are actively marketing our products and solutions. We currently use a direct sales force consisting of employees as well as expert consultants, particularly in geography. Because our solutions use technology that is not yet fully adopted by customers within our target markets in every case, we expect that the customer decision process will continue to include substantial time educating end-users and stakeholders, which may result in a continued lengthy sales cycle.
 
We have built a database of companies and organizations who have offshore operations. We market our products and solutions to these companies and entities, prioritizing those who we believe are most likely to want remote offshore power and data services, including for example, offshore oil and gas companies. We also see opportunities for defense and security applications such as maritime domain awareness solutions that require autonomous offshore power, data gateways and robust data acquisition storage and communication systems.
 
One of the primary ways we showcase our Company, products and services is through demonstrations, conferences, and trade shows. We utilize our database to select conferences and trade shows where we will have the most effective visibility to our potential clients. Since early 2020, COVID-restrictions have significantly impacted our attendance as, many conferences and trade shows were cancelled, rescheduled, or held virtually. In fiscal 2022, OPT presented at a number of these conferences virtually and in-person. During fiscal 2023, we have plans to attend and present at various demonstrations, conferences, and trade shows in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
 
Additionally, we seek to enter into strategic relationships to develop application solutions with commercial and military sensor and equipment manufacturers.
 
Competition
 
We expect to compete with other providers in the Data as a Service, Power as a Service, and Strategic Consulting industries. Our Data as a Service solution competes with other data acquisition companies in a variety of industries, from sensor and measurement equipment providers to other providers of autonomous vehicles.
 
Our Power as a Service solution competes with other offshore autonomous power sources, primarily consisting of subsea batteries, solar and fossil-fuel power sources, where many of the providers are substantially larger than us and may have access to greater financial resources. Incumbent sources of offshore power may also represent established and reliable power sources and may have already gained customer acceptance. Our ability to compete successfully for business from applications seeking offshore power will depend on (a) our ability to produce and store energy reliably and at a total cost that is competitive with or lower than that of other sources, and (b) the demonstrated reliability of our products and positive customer perception of our company. We also may have the opportunity to cooperate with other solution providers, such as other suppliers of subsea batteries where our PowerBuoys® could provide recharging capabilities or other providers of autonomous surface or underwater vessels where our PowerBuoys® could provide charging and enhanced communications capabilities.
 
Competition for the WAM-V® product line includes companies marketing solutions as autonomous surface vehicles (“ASVs”) and uncrewed surface vehicles (“USVs”) which can also be referred to as unmanned surface vehicles. There are several established competitors in this space with the pace of new entrants increasing in-line with the expanding market opportunities.

The vast majority of the companies in the DOE’s wave energy converter database are small, early-stage companies with a limited number of employees that do not have our in-ocean validation experience. Only a few of these companies have conducted testing similar to us, such as accelerated life testing and extensive wave tank testing on small-scale models of their devices. We believe our in-ocean experience is critical towards proving the reliability, survivability and performance of any wave energy system, which we believe our future customers will require before adopting any wave generated energy solution. We believe our experience gained through full scale in-ocean deployments, coupled with other types of factory and laboratory testing, and our resulting understanding of risks and failure modes provides us with an advantage compared to potential wave energy competitors.
 
Based on market and industry observations, we believe there are only a small number of companies that are developing systems to compete in the offshore autonomous power market; however, their technologies are in earlier stages of development with limited commercial deployments. Through our ongoing product development and building upon our years of commercial deployment data, we believe that we continue to maintain a first mover advantage in the smaller scale autonomous offshore power market.
 
Our Strategic Consulting Services group competes with offshore engineering firms. These include large and small engineering firms that specialize in naval architecture, structural engineering, and hydrodynamics as applied to the design of jack-ups, wind turbine installation vessels, and semi-submersibles.
 
We continuously monitor non-traditional competitive threats, such as multi-domain drones and artificial intelligence tools utilizing satellite data. We are in active discussions with companies in these markets to evaluate synergistic solution development where we believe there may be a demand for cooperative solutions.
 
Commercial Activities
 
We continue to seek new strategic relationships and further develop our existing partnerships. We collaborate with companies that have developed or are developing in-ocean applications requiring a persistent source of power that is also capable of real time data collection, processing and communication, to address potential customer needs. The table below shows the percentage of the Company’s revenues derived from customers whose revenues accounted for at least 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues for at least one of the periods indicated:

 | Twelve months ended April 30, | 
------------------------------------+-------------------------------+----
Customer | 2022 | | | 2021
Transocean Ltd. | | 15 | % | | — | %
Valaris PLC | | 12 | % | | — | %
Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. | | 11 | % | | — | %
United States Department of Energy | | 11 | % | | — | %
Enel Green Power Chile, LTDA | | 9 | % | | 61 | %
Eni S.p.A. | | 1 | % | | 22 | %
Other (no other customers over 10%) | | 41 | % | | 17 | %
 | | 100 | % | | 100 | %

 
In order to achieve success in ongoing commercializing efforts for our products, we must expand our customer base and obtain commercial contracts to lease or sell our solutions and services to customers. Our potential customer base for our solutions includes various public and private entities, and agencies that require remote offshore power. We expect an increased portion of our revenues will be from the lease or sale of our products and related maintenance as well as consultative and other services.

Business Relationships
 
We believe that our solutions are best developed, sold, deployed, and maintained together with subject matter experts in their respective fields. This enables the Company to protect, maintain, and evolve our various platforms and integrate them with surface and subsea payloads. The Company has previously entered into business relationships focused on including, but not limited to, deployment and installations, sourcing of surface payloads, and integration with autonomous vehicles. To further develop the MDAS, we recently entered into strategic software and robotics partnerships with two software companies, Greensea Systems, Inc. and Fathom5. We believe the business relationships with Greensea and Fathom5 will further the development of our next-generation MDAS product for the maritime industrial market and governmental defense and security organizations.
 
Greensea Systems, Inc. is contributing to the Company’s MDAS by providing integration software, control software, autonomy and systems integration for the buoy sensor payload.
 
Fathom5 has designed and is building a customized industrial analytics platform to support the Company’s MDAS. The Fathom5 customized platform will integrate sensor technologies, combine data feeds, and provide a flexible plug-in analytic capability to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to sensor feeds. Fathom5 is also building the user interface that will allow remote operators to control the MDAS payload and view sensor data in real time.
 
We also maintain active dialogue with several offshore deployment and marine operations partners in the North Sea and North America to support our projects.
 
Backlog
 
As of April 30, 2022, the Company’s backlog was $0.6 million. As of April 30, 2021, backlog was $0.2 million. Our backlog can include unfilled firm orders for our products and services from commercial or governmental customers. If any of our contracts were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining terms of such contract.
 
The amount of contract backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenue because modifications to or terminations of present contracts and production delays can provide additional revenue or reduce anticipated revenue. A substantial portion of our revenues is recognized using the input method used to measure completion over time of customer contracts, and changes in estimates from time to time may have a significant effect on revenue and backlog. Our backlog is also typically subject to large variations from time to time due to the timing of new awards.
 
Research and Development
 
Larger Power
 
We believe there is demand for larger power for applications in several markets. The continued electrification of the seabed, together with the increased volume of sensors and vehicles available on the market, requires larger power devices in the <20kW range.
 
We continue to innovate through our research and development efforts to bring to market devices with power ranges larger than the hybrid PB and including other wave energy converter platforms through partnerships with other wave power energy developers. In parallel, the Company is investigating larger power alternatives, in cooperation with design and installation contractors, and other technical resources. These efforts include further developments of our Mass on Spring Wave Energy Converter “MOSWEC”, which allows for greater modularity and decreased maintenance intervals.
 
MDAS
 
Expanding on our experience with our own initial prototype Marine Surveillance Solutions (“MSS”) system, we intend for the development of the next generation MDAS, which will combine radar, marine automatic identification system (“AIS”) and camera data with a custom developed command and control system to provide actionable information for our end users. We believe the sensor suite will be a combination of off-the-shelf components selected to optimize performance and cost.

This system could be utilized as a standalone node or in an array, which we believe will provide near real-time information about the marine activity within a customer’s area of interest.
 
PB3 PowerBuoy®
 
We engaged our resources to improve PB3 efficiency, reliability and power output, and improve manufacturability while reducing cost and complexity. Our recent efforts have been focused on reducing the cost of our PB3 systems and their deployment costs in order to balance customer cost with our solution value proposition. We continue to seek to increase the capabilities of our PB3 systems by designing flexible interfaces and rendering them sensor and payload agnostic. Further, we are working to integrate PB3 and WAM-V® capabilities by adding WAM-V recharging capabilities to our PB3’s and MDAS capabilities to our WAM-V’s®, thus extending WAM-V endurance, our reach, and providing both fixed and mobile MDAS offerings to our customers.
 
In fiscal year 2023, we plan to kick off the development of the next generation PowerBuoy®, which will incorporate lessons learned and customer feedback from various deployments of the PB3, hybrid, and other test buoys in an effort to optimize power generation through hybridization of renewable energy sources and lower installed cost of the system.
 
WAM-V
 
We will continue to develop the capabilities of the WAM-V 8, WAM-V 16, and WAM-V 22 variants for the marine survey and defense & security markets. Control systems development will continue to provide additional features based on feedback from existing customers as well as our gained experience in our Robotics as a Service (RaaS) offering. Additionally, we will continue to develop and enhance our obstacle detection and obstacle avoidance capabilities.
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our experience differentiates us from other providers of Data as a Service, Power as a Service, and wave energy conversion technologies. As a result, our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing upon our proprietary rights. Our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuous technological innovation and may rely on licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
As of April 30, 2022, we have been issued 70 U.S. patents, of which 39 are active, 20 have expired and 11 were abandoned. Outside of the U.S., we have been issued 280 patents across 25 countries with 26 of the active U.S. patents having at least one corresponding issued foreign patent. We have not filed any additional U.S. patent application since June 10, 2021. Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications with claims directed to:
 

● | System design, including buoy, battery chargers, generators, power take off, printed circuit boards, and wave energy convertor (“WEC”); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | WEC control systems; 
● | Wave power and thermal motor power conversion; 
● | Buoy anchoring and mooring design and power cable connection; and 
● | Wave WEC farm architecture. 

 
The expiration dates for our issued U.S. patents range from 2023 to 2040. We do not consider any single patent or patent application that we hold to be material to our business. The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in continuing to obtain effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. In addition, certain technologies that we developed with U.S. federal government funding are subject to certain government rights as described in “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”

We use trademarks on nearly all our products and believe that having distinctive marks is an important factor in marketing our products. We have registered our PowerBuoy®, PB-Vue ®, PowerTower ®, Making Waves in Power ®, Talk on Water ®, and WAM-V® trademarks in the United States. Trademark ownership is generally of indefinite duration when marks are properly maintained in commercial use.
 
Regulation
 
Our products are subject to regulation in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions concerning, among other areas, site approval, use restrictions, and environmental approval and compliance. In order to encourage the adoption of offshore power solutions, many governments offer subsidies and other financial incentives and have mandated renewable energy targets, which some of our customers may be able to leverage. However, these subsidies, incentives and targets may not be applicable to our technology and therefore may not be available to our customers.
 
WAM-Vs are subject to a patchwork of rules and regulations in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the operation of autonomous and uncrewed surface vehicles. Often times, rules and regulations specific to autonomous, uncrewed, and/or unmanned surface vehicles do not exist or are not explicitly defined. We advise our customers to always follow the rules and regulations as they apply in the jurisdiction in which they are operating.
 
The renewable energy industry has also been subject to increasing regulation. As both the renewable energy industry and as the wave energy industries continue to evolve, we anticipate that wave energy technology and our PowerBuoys® and their deployment will be subject to increased oversight and regulation in accordance with international, national and local regulations relating to safety, site approval, and environmental protection.
 
Site Approval. In the U.S., federal agencies regulate the siting of long-term renewable energy projects and related-uses located on the outer continental shelf (“OCS”), which is generally more than three miles offshore. OCS projects longer than one-year in duration are regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”). For projects located within three miles of the U.S. shore regardless of duration, the adjacent state would be responsible for issuing a lease and other required authorizations for the location of the project. Generally, the same process applies to foreign sites where site approval is contingent on meeting both national and local regulatory and environmental requirements. In connection with issuing permits or leases enabling project use, the respective government agency often requires site restoration or other activities at the conclusion of the permit or lease period.
 
Environmental Approval, Compliance, and Health and Safety. We are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things: the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of our employees.
 
Subsidies and Incentives. Renewable energy subsidies and incentives are generally applicable only to electric generation and supply to the utility grid. However, our autonomous applications may result in a reduction of carbon emissions, which our potential customers may be able to publicize in their environmental stewardship reports.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our core in-house manufacturing activity includes the assembly, final systems integration and testing of our products and components, which is conducted at our New Jersey headquarters and at our Richmond, California facility.
 
Our corporate headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in Monroe Township, New Jersey. This facility offers approximately 56,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space and allows for expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and a move toward higher volume production of our solutions. During fiscal year 2022 we began the process of transferring the majority of the manufacturing activity related to our WAM-V’s from our Richmond, California facility to our New Jersey headquarters. This move is primarily related to allowing us to scale our WAM-V manufacturing using existing facilities, as the Richmond, CA facility is too small to support our expected growth plan. We believe our current manufacturing facilities are suitable, adequate and provide productive capacity for the Company.

Human Capital
 
The Company believes that its future success is dependent in part on its continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. Therefore, investing in, developing and maintaining human capital is critical to our success. The Company is committed to provide its employees with a safe and healthy workplace. On April 30, 2022, the Company had 54 full-time employees as compared to 46 at April 30, 2021. None of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company is an equal opportunity employer. and as such provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, creed, ancestry, national origin, citizenship, sex or gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, and pregnancy-related conditions), gender identity or expression (including transgender status), sexual orientation, marital status, religion, age, disability, genetic information, service in the military, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local laws and ordinances. At OPT, we foster a culture of inclusion, embrace diversity, and seek to listen without judgement to all voices and opinions. Therefore, OPT is committed to creating and maintaining a workplace in which all employees have an opportunity to participate and contribute to the success of the business and are valued for their skills, experience, and unique perspectives. Association with OPT involves participation in a community where all people are recognized and rewarded on the basis of individual qualifications and abilities. This commitment is embodied in company policy and the way we do business at OPT and is an important principle of sound business management. We believe that providing our employees with the appropriate resources will allow our employees to use their creativity and talent to invent new solutions, meet new demands, and offer the most effective services/products in the industry.
 
The Company is committed to provide its employees with a healthy and safe work environment, which include policies to guide our efforts. We take a proactive approach to the identification and control of environment, health and safety hazards and risks. We work to continuously improve our Quality, Health, Safety, and Environment (“QHSE”) performance through methodologies that aim to prevent workplace injuries and illness, emphasis on quality production, and provide ongoing safety education to employees. On June 2, 2021, the Company achieved ISO 45001 certification Bureau Veritas (BV) for a 3-year term. ISO 45001 is an international occupation health and safety certification. We also recently passed our annual external audit from BV related to this certification. The safety management system provides procedures to enhance our safety profile and reduce incidents, so all of our employees go home safely every day. Our focus over the next year will be on implementing stop work authority, identification of hazards and risks whether at sea or in the shop, identification of lagging and leading indicators, and performance of quality investigations. Our long-term goal is to become a generative QHSE culture.
 
ESG
 
The Company recognizes the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) as essential elements to its success, delivering products that help reduce our customers’ carbon emission and preserve our oceans’ natural resources and as such, its board of directors has established an Environmental and Sustainability Committee, which assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by assessing the effectiveness of the Company’s programs and initiatives that support environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and sustainability policies, programs, and practices of the Company. The Company is committed to delivering innovative products and solutions while simultaneously working with high integrity, quality, a strong governance culture and respect for our employees, customers, vendors and the people in the communities where we do business. The Company believes that consideration of ESG matters is important to how it, and its solutions and services affect the environments, communities and societies in which it operates around the world. By adhering to international, national, and local customs, we believe we meet our governance obligations from the environment to personnel to safety. Despite our size, the Company views itself as a responsible corporate citizen throughout the execution of its operations, as emphasized by its goal to provide low-carbon power and data solutions for offshore industries, scientific research, and territorial security. It is the Company’s goal that all products have minimal environmental impact footprint compared to alternative solutions. This includes minimizing the emissions for both our facilities and products, implementing and deploying a database to track our carbon savings, utilizing renewable energy to power offshore data solutions, and providing products and solutions that monitor sensitive ecological areas. Each deployed PB3 utilized in place of fossil fuel-based power in Power as a Service applications can displace four tonnes of carbon annually, or roughly the amount of carbon produced by two average automobiles. When combined with our MDAS for applications typically serviced by a manned guard vessel powered by diesel fuel, this can displace more than 300 tonnes of carbon for every 10 vessel days replaced, or the equivalent of removing more than 125 cars from the road.

In February 2022, the Company submitted an application for the NJ Clean Energy Program which offers free energy benchmarking to compare energy usage to other commercial buildings in similar industries and provide recommendation to improve efficiency. The Company is working with a case manager for the program and anticipates completion of the energy benchmarking report in the coming months. This report will include an energy usage score relative to similar commercial facilities in related industries and detailed information on implementing energy efficient technologies and available financial incentive programs available through the state program.
 
In parallel, the Company has initiated an environmental impact assessment on our products, starting with the PB3, with a focus on the potential of any environmental hazards of materials. Further data is being gathered around the PB3 to determine the risk to marine life including risk associated with our batteries and the potential use of propane in our hybrid PB. Our batteries contain no toxic or rare earth metals and have a minimal risk of fires or explosion. In the unlikely event that water comes into contract with live batteries, wireless remote operation allows for the immediate discharge of energy to mitigate the risk of electrolysis that could create an explosive mixture of hydrogen and oxygen within the buoy. Further research is being performed around hazardous materials and any other risks related to our WAM-V® product line, including risk associated with the batteries we use in this product.

Business Update Regarding COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic presented substantial health and economic risks, uncertainties and challenges to our business, the global economy and financial markets. During 2020 we started to experience some delays related to the impact of COVID-19 on the international supply chain. We were able to mitigate much of the impact by consuming not only internal inventory but also by expanding our supply base. While our supply chain is primarily domestically oriented with the majority of our products domestically sourced, we obtain some components from Asia and Europe. We use a combination of off-the-shelf components and equipment as well as custom developed parts. There have been a number of disruptions throughout the global supply chain which have impacted our development and manufacturing. As the global economy continues to open up, it is driving the demand for certain components. This has outpaced the return of the global supply chain to full production. Although we have been able to find alternatives for many component shortages without compromising our product standards or integrity, we experienced, and continue to experience, some delays and cost increases with respect to container shortages, ocean shipping and air freight. In addition, our key suppliers have experienced longer lead times and cost increases for raw materials and have experienced periods of interruption to production due to COVID-19 and its variants affecting manpower.
 
As of April 30, 2022, local manpower and similar COVID-related problems are starting to ease. Like others in the industry we continue to have concerns over component shortages, particularly for semiconductors, lithium-ion batteries and specialty metals, however, this has not prevented us from manufacturing our products. If spikes in COVID-19 and its variants occur in regions in which our supply chain operates, we could experience periodic interruptions or impacts due to delays in components and incur further freight price increases. We continue to monitor and adjust our operations, as appropriate. in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
