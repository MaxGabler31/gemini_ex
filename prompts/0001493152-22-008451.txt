ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History and Background
 
Legacy Education Alliance, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on November 23, 2010 in Nevada under the name Streamline Resources, Inc. Our name was subsequently changed to Priced In Corp (“PRCD”) on April 24, 2012. Prior to the merger discussed below, we were a shell corporation with nominal operating activity.
 
On November 10, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of such date the (“Merger Agreement”) by and among (i) PRCD, a Nevada corporation, (ii) Priced In Corp. Subsidiary, a Colorado corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PRCD (“PRCD Sub”), (iii) Tigrent Inc., a Colorado corporation (“TIGE”), and (iv) Legacy Education Alliance Holdings, Inc., a Colorado corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of TIGE (“Legacy Holdings”). On November 10, 2014, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, PRCD Sub merged with and into Legacy Holdings (the “Merger”), with Legacy Holdings surviving the Merger and becoming our wholly owned subsidiary and we acquired the business of Legacy Holdings.
 
At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”):
 

● | PRCD amended and restated its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which included an increase in our authorized stock to 220 million shares (200 million shares of common stock and 20 million shares of preferred stock); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | PRCD changed its name from “Priced In Corp.” to “Legacy Education Alliance, Inc.”; 
● | All of the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Legacy Holdings outstanding at the Effective Time were converted and exchanged into 16,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”) and were held by TIGE. 

 
As a result of the Merger, TIGE owned approximately 80% of Legacy with the then remaining outstanding shares (3,997,500) held by the existing PRCD shareholders.
 
There was no cash consideration exchanged in the Merger. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, PRCD agreed to pay TIGE taxes and related liabilities and other specified costs and expenses, including certain administrative and related expenses that have been or will be from time to time incurred by TIGE that are related to TIGE’s investment in PRCD (including the cost of preparing and distributing reports regarding our business and financial condition to its shareholders), its administrative costs and expenses, and taxes, other than income taxes arising from dividends or distributions by us to TIGE. All shares of PRCD common stock issued in connection with the Merger are restricted securities, as defined in paragraph (a) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Such shares were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated there under.
 
The Merger was accounted for as a “reverse merger” and recapitalization since, immediately following the completion of the transaction, the holders of TIGE’s stock had effective control of PRCD. In addition, TIGE controlled the surviving entity through control of Legacy’s Board of Directors as a result of the appointment of the existing directors of TIGE to the four board seats of Legacy. Additionally, all of TIGE’s officers and senior executive positions continued on as management of the surviving entity after consummation of the Merger. For accounting purposes, Legacy Holdings was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction was treated as a recapitalization of PRCD. Accordingly, Legacy Holdings’ assets, liabilities and results of operations became the historical financial statements of the registrant, and the Company’s assets, liabilities and results of operations were consolidated with PRCD effective as of the date of the closing of the Merger. Prior to the Merger, PRCD was a “shell” corporation with nominal assets, liabilities and operating activity. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction.
 
On February 14, 2017, TIGE completed the distribution of 15,998,326 shares of Common Stock in Legacy approved by the Board of Directors of TIGE on October 4, 2016. Pursuant to the distribution, 1.00105 shares of Legacy Common Stock were distributed for each share of stock held in TIGE.
 
For a further discussion of the Merger and its effects on our business, please see the information contained in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on November 10, 2014, and the related amendments thereto.

Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to be the leading provider of services and products that enable individuals from all walks of life, regardless of their current economic situation and educational background, to take control of their financial futures and enable them to achieve financial freedom.
 
Our strategy is focused primarily on the following areas:
 

● | Continued development of our businesses. We will continue our focus on our service offerings in an attempt to improve our revenue and expand our offerings as appropriate, including e-learning and other electronic format offerings and the development of new proprietary brands. In November 2020, the Company shifted its focus to its Legacy EducationTM products, with Building Wealth with LegacyTM as the new flagship brand, which encompasses hands-on experience and the true spirit of investing from beginner to educated investor, within a community of like-minded individuals. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Development of higher-margin proprietary brands. Since November 2020, shifted its focus to developing proprietary brands, which have no royalty and other associated costs, but will require us the Company to market in new and innovative ways. This will allow us the flexibility to provide our services through different demographics, price points and sales channels, and to develop additional complementary products and services. 
● | Fulfilling our customer obligations. We intend to improve the cost efficiency with which we fulfill our customer commitments. We have: 


● | Expanded the options for course fulfillment to reduce the number of expired contracts by increasing the number of courses offered through electronic media and via the internet; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Implemented an improved outreach program that involves contacting our customers to help them manage their course schedules; 


● | Enhanced eLearning. We continue developing and promoting interactive and online distributed course content and enhanced technology platforms capable of streaming video, interactive e-learning, and distributed e-learning. During the fourth quarter 2021, we began transitioning from live events to eLearning. This modification will enable us to reach more real estate investors and offer more diversity in educational opportunities to customers. Our eLearning community will deliver business advancement to attendees through education and offer an arena for attendees to discover new relationships with companies, as well as their fellow investors. The transition to eLearning will also reduce any future pandemic risks. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Consistent quality assurance. We believe that to be an effective provider of training we need to ensure that our course offerings meet our strict quality assurance guidelines. We will continue to monitor and enforce standards for marketing, sales presentations, and training delivery throughout our organization. 
● | Continued professional development. We will continue to identify, recruit, and retain a team of trainers, mentors and coaches who possess practical, hands-on experience in their areas of expertise. 
● | Development of Strategic Growth Initiatives. On March 15, 2022, we announced various strategic initiatives for the next 12 months. We are embarking on a number of transactions which we expect will strengthen the Company’s balance sheet and strategic positioning, including relationships with Exampil and multiple education guidance counselors, marketers and non-profits. Furthermore, the foundation of our proposed Nasdaq uplisting includes the potential spinoff of the existing Legacy Education business, which was previously approved by shareholders, and the proposed acquisition of Coopersmith Career Consulting, each of which are in process but we can give no assurance at this time of success.

Recent Developments
 
Impact from COVID-19 Pandemic.
 
Historically, our operations have relied heavily on our and our students’ ability to travel and attend live events where large groups of people gather in local markets within each of the segments in which we operate. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. As a result of worldwide restrictions on travel and social distancing, in March 2020, we temporarily ceased conducting live sales and fulfillment and furloughed substantially all of our employees. We resumed sales operations in June 2020 with online sales events selling into our suite of online, on-demand, and over-the-phone products. We also resumed online, on-demand, and over-the-phone fulfillment activities in June 2020. We resumed live operations in November 2020, with events in Florida.
 
During 2021, the Company conducted additional live events following strict safety protocols in other areas as lockdown restrictions eased. We have simplified our product offerings and restructured our compensation program with respect to both employees and independent contractors to reduce costs and improve margins, but there can be no assurances that the Company will be effective in selling its products and services, or what the impact such activities will have on our financial performance. In December 2021, we temporarily suspended live in-person events to focus on eLearning opportunities. The temporary suspension continues indefinitely into fiscal year 2022. The ultimate impact from the pandemic on the Company’s operations and financial results will depend on, the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains COVID-19.
 
Changes in Management and Board of Directors
 
On March 8, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors elected Michel Botbol as a Director, Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. On the same date, the Board appointed James E. May as General Counsel of the Company, a position he held prior to his appointment as Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company in January 2019. Upon the assumption of his position as General Counsel, Mr. May resigned as Director and Chief Executive Officer.
 
On November 4, 2021, Messrs. Harper and Sucoff notified the Board of Directors of their resignations as a director of the Company and no replacements has been identified to date. Mr. May also resigned on November 4, 2021 and our chief financial officer resigned on November 8, 2021, at which time Barry Kostiner assumed the role of interim principal financial and accounting officer.
 
On December 1, 2021, Mr. Botbol resigned as a Director, Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Kostiner assumed the multiple roles of Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and Interim Principal Financial and Accounting Officer.


Business Overview
 
We are a provider of practical, high-quality, and value-based educational training on the topics of personal finance, entrepreneurship, real estate investing strategies and techniques. Our programs are offered through a variety of formats and channels, including free workshops, basic trainings, forums, telephone mentoring, one-on-one mentoring, coaching and e-learning.
 
Since January 1, 2020, we have operated under two brands:
 

● | Building Wealth with Legacy TM provides practical, high-quality and value-based educational training on the topics of personal finance, entrepreneurship, real estate, financial markets and investing strategies and techniques. This training program encompasses hands-on experience and the true spirit of investing from beginner to educated investor. During the fiscal year 2021, the Company marketed products and services exclusively under this brand. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Homemade Investor by Tarek El MoussaTM introduces people to the investor mindset, real estate investing strategies, and ways to generate cash flow that are designed to help build a foundation of knowledge for their financial goals. Homemade Investor events offered nationwide free workshops, 3-day trainings and large stage events with Tarek presenting as the keynote speaker, all selling into our advanced training products. In November 2020, we suspended conducting Homemade Investor by Tarek El MoussaTM sales events to focus on developing our proprietary Building Wealth with Legacy TM: 

 
Our students pay for their courses in full up-front or through payment agreements with independent third parties. Under United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), we recognize revenue upon the earlier of (i) when our students take their courses or (ii) the term for taking their course expires, both of which could be several quarters after the student purchases a program and pays the fee. We recognize revenue immediately when we sell our (i) proprietary products delivered at time of sale and (ii) third party products sales. Our symposiums and forums combine multiple advanced training courses in one location, allowing us to achieve certain economies of scale that reduce costs and improve margins while also accelerating U.S. GAAP revenue recognition, while at the same time, enhancing our students’ experience, particularly, for example, through the opportunity to network with other students.

We also provide a richer experience for our students through one-on-one mentoring (two to four days in length, on site or remotely and telephone mentoring (10 to 16 weekly one-on-one or one-on-many telephone sessions). Mentoring involves a subject matter expert interacting with the student remotely or in person and guiding the student, for example, through his or her first real estate transaction, providing a real hands-on experience.
 
Today we are a global company that has cumulatively served more than two million students from more than 150 countries and territories over the course of our operating history.

Marketing
 
Our various brands are the foundation for our marketing efforts. These brands provide credibility and sustainability within our media mix to promote live events and online trainings. Historically, live onsite two-hour free preview workshops are offered weekly in multiple markets in North America. Marketing these events is primarily through social media posts, internet banner ads, text ads, and emails. Direct mail, radio, television, public relations, and print advertising may also be used to obtain event registrations. We enter into marketing and other agreements with third parties to advertise our products and services. During 2021, we transitioned to offering a diversification of hybrid training courses such as live in person, live online, and on demand for greater accessibility to students.
 
We offer people the opportunity to attend a free preview workshop or advance directly to one of our three-day basic training classes. People who enroll and attend the basic training class receive reference materials relevant to the subject matter to be taught at the class. The basic training course is usually held over a weekend within two to four weeks of the initial free preview workshop. Our experience is that offering the free preview workshop as a first step is an effective way to introduce to our students the methodology of investing, as well as to market and sell our three-day basic training courses.
 
Marketing efforts continue to those customers who choose to continue their education with a three-day basic training class. Welcome letters, product kits that include manuals, books and audio files, an online reference library, and reminder communication letters and emails are all branded for consistency and credibility. Customers at the three-day basic training may choose to continue their education through our elite training classes and mentorships offered during the basic training classes.
 
We utilize different preview brands to market into our advance training division, which we re-branded to Elite Legacy Education to expand our market reach. Elite training classes are fulfilled through various delivery methods to meet the needs of our customers.
 
We also market for new customers who prefer to learn online and provide people the opportunity to attend free ninety-minute live online webinars that are held weekly on six different topics. Webinars are marketed via online banner ads, affiliate marketing, email campaigns, social media and other media methods.
 
Training Programs
 
We have three significant categories for our programs:
 

● | Basic training live and online courses, 
--+------------------------------------------------------
● | Elite level live and online training courses, and 
● | Individualized mentoring programs.

The goal of our fulfillment strategy is to provide maximum flexibility to the students to allow them take any of their classes in whatever format, and in any combination of formats, that works best for them. Students may access training content through multiple delivery channels, including:
 

● | Live Classroom: In-person “one-on-many” intensive 3-day class with a live instructor and any number of students in the same room, at a symposium, a forum or as a stand-alone class. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Live Stream: Interactive real-time streaming of a Live Classroom training that may be viewed by a student remotely via the internet. Live stream classes can be reviewed for 30-days post-class. 
● | Live On-Line: Live presentations of a class in modules presented over a period of weeks with a live instructor and any number of students in any number of locations who attend remotely via the internet. Student has access to recordings of the modules for 30 days after the last live session. 
● | On-Demand: Class that is presented in self-paced pre-recorded modules via internet link with 24/7 access for the life of the contract. Unlike the three “live” fulfillment options, which require the student to attend classes when LEAI schedules them, the On-Demand Options provides the student the flexibility to take the class whenever they want, and as many times as they want, during the life of the student’s contract. 

 
Through strategic partners, customers can purchase a license to use supporting software for real estate or financial markets investing. With either software program, a subscription-based data service is available for purchase which allows customers to interactively determine investment options and make better informed decisions about potential investments.
 
Individualized Mentoring and Coaching Programs
 
We offer live, real time, one-on-one mentoring for Real Estate, Business and the Financial Markets that are tailored to meet students’ individual goals and needs. Real Estate mentoring is offered on site at the student’s chosen location, while Financial Market mentoring can be provided either on-site or remotely. Mentoring is intended to give the student a professional assessment of his or her individual goals and experience and to help the student build an investment plan that can be put into action. Mentoring sessions are generally 2 to 4 days in length.
 
Coaching and telephone mentoring programs are typically sold in a number of different subject areas and generally delivered in 10 to 16 weekly one-on-one telephone sessions. Some of the topics include Real Estate Coaching, Financial Markets Coaching and Business Coaching. A set curriculum approach is generally used. Each module comes with assignments, exercises and reading materials to be completed between sessions.
 
Competition
 
During our more than 20-year history, we have competed with several organizations within the U.S. and internationally. Our primary competitors are Fortune Builders and Mayflower Alliance Ltd. Some of these competitors have established brands through a media-based relationship, such as HGTV, and use television programs to promote their brands.
 
The main competitors to our financial markets strategies and techniques course offerings are large institutional brokerage houses, who have been offering education as a way to expand their client portfolio.
 
Generally, competitive factors within the proprietary training market include:
 

● | The range and depth of course offerings; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The quality of trainers; 
● | The quality of reference materials provided in connection with course studies; and 
● | Cost. 

 
We believe that the range and depth of our course offerings, the quality of our trainers and reference materials are comparable or superior to those of our competitors. Typically, our trainers for our Elite courses have been active investors in their chosen field, have been trained by us and, to a large degree, are previous customers of our programs. Trainers for our Elite courses are chosen based on their knowledge and experience with the coursework covered and are further qualified by meeting knowledge standards developed internally.

Brand Development Agreement with the T&B Seminars, Inc.
 
Effective December 23, 2019, we entered into a Real Estate Education Training Program Development Agreement (the “Development Agreement”) with T&B Seminars, Inc. (“T&B”), an affiliate of Tarek El Moussa, pursuant to which Holdings and Tarek El Moussa agreed to develop and operate a seminar style education business that will use, among other things, the names, images, and likenesses of Tarek El Moussa to market and sell customers real estate investing oriented education products. Pursuant to the Development Agreement, T&B granted to the Company a sole and exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property, including, certain trademarks and copyrights and the name, image and likeness of Tarek El Moussa, in each case to the extent necessary for Holdings to develop and create educational materials and promote and conduct a branded real estate seminar style education business that uses the intellectual property.
 
As consideration for the licensed rights under the Development Agreement, Holdings agreed to pay T&B base royalty percentages on cash sales of products to persons responding to a branded marketing campaign that uses the licensed intellectual property. Also, as consideration for Tarek El Moussa providing certain marketing support, Holdings agreed to pay T&B marketing royalty percentages on cash sales of products at live events and at online webinars to persons responding to a branded marketing campaign that uses the licensed intellectual property. Furthermore, as consideration for the exclusivity of the rights under the Development Agreement, commencing on the seventh month of the term of the Development Agreement, Holdings agreed that the monthly royalties paid to T&B will not be less than an agreed to amount.
 
The Development Agreement has an initial term of five years and will automatically renew thereafter for successive five-year terms unless either party provides prior written notice of termination no less than 90 days prior to the end of such five-year term.
 
The Company commenced sales activities under the Development Agreement under the Homemade Investor brand in January 2020 but as a result of the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended conducting live in-persons sales events in March 2020. Subsequently, we suspended online sales events during the third quarter of 2020 to focus on our new flagship brand Building Wealth with LegacyTM. During 2021, the Company is still fulfilling student contracts.

Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 19 full-time employees, of whom 19, or 100 % were in our North America segment. In addition, we employ part-time employees in various capacities and independent contractors who are trainers, coaches or mentors. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, and we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory. We are committed to providing competitive pay, healthcare, and a comprehensive benefits package in order to recruit and maintain employees. Our independent contractors are either paid commissions based upon the dollar value of the courses purchased by customers at our free preview workshops and basic training courses or are paid fixed fees for teaching and mentoring Elite courses. Independent contractors are required to execute agreements with us that set forth their commission structures and typically contain confidentiality and non-competition provisions. We continue to build a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment to attract, develop, and retain top talent. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to build a remote workforce with resources and support to succeed.
