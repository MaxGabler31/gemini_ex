Item 1. Business
Background
 
Business Overview
 
Reign Sapphire Corp. (OTCQB: RGNP) was established on December 15, 2014 in the State of Delaware and is a Beverly Hills-based, direct-to-consumer (“D2C”) branded and custom jewelry company with four niche brands: Reign Sapphires: ethically produced, millennial targeted sapphire jewelry, Coordinates Collection: custom jewelry, inscribed with location coordinates commemorating life’s special moments, Le Bloc: classic customized jewelry and ION Collection by Jen Selter an athleisure jewelry brand.
Reign Sapphire
 
Reign Sapphire was established as a vertically integrated “source to retail” model for sapphires--rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires. We are not an exploration or mining company and are not engaged in exploration or mining activities. We purchase rough sapphires in bulk, directly from commercial miners in Australia, and we intend to oversee each step of the process as the stones go from the miners-gate to the consumer as Reign Sapphire jewelry.
 
Our core values are to offer consumers conflict free sapphires; sapphires that are mined from a verified source; sapphires that have been procured directly from miners, sapphires that are ethically processed and sapphires that are natural (not synthetic). In addition, we intend to feature exclusively Australian sapphires in our jewelry collections.
 
Coordinates Collection
 
Coordinates Collection markets and distributes custom jewelry, inscribed with location coordinates commemorating life’s special moments. Coordinates Collection is the next level of customized jewelry that pairs high quality craftsmanship with a fresh look. Geographic coordinates pinpoint the location of a favorite memory and the beautiful engraving personalizes each piece to the customer. Coordinates Collection uses high quality materials such as semi-precious to precious metals and stones as well as ceramic coatings. All products take personalization to the next level with stylish, high quality hand-crafted products, a customized experience and a unique technology platform that guides the customer through a step-by-step process to create the perfect meaningful piece.
 
ION Collection
 
ION Collection is jewelry inscribed with location coordinates commemorating life’s special moments, milestones and achievements using bright colors and textures for everyday wear. ION Collection takes the ‘Coordinates Collection’ custom jewelry concept into the athleisure and streetwear space.


Le Bloc
 
Le Bloc markets and distributes classic custom jewelry. Le Bloc is a way to wear your favorite letters and/or words. The collection is comprised of bracelets, necklaces, and rings featuring bloc’s engraved with a single letter in the finish of your choice.
Acquisition of Assets Related to the Coordinates Collection Business
 
On December 1, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of CCI (the “Acquisition”). CCI is engaged in the marketing and distribution of Coordinates Collection and Le Bloc customized jewelry. Upon the closing of the Acquisition, we received substantially all of the operating assets of CCI, consisting of fixed assets and intellectual property. As part of the Acquisition, we created a wholly owned subsidiary, Reign Brands Inc, which is a Delaware corporation, and acts as the operating entity for the acquired CCI assets.

With the acquisition of the Coordinates Collection and Le Bloc brands, we plan to leverage our custom jewelry expertise to expand distribution worldwide.
 
The purchase price of the operating assets of CCI was the issuance 7,000,000 shares of common stock (of which 1,000,000 shares were issued to ASK Gold, a major supplier) valued at $770,000 (based on our stock price on the date of issuance). In addition, there is a cash payment of $500,000 contingent upon a future offering and earn out payments for all sales of CCI and RGNP products sold via CCI sales channels for the 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 calendar years. The estimated fair value of the contingent payments totaled $424,511 and was recognized as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. We accounted for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting was used to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company. Such accounting generally results in increased amortization and depreciation reported in future periods. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor and the Company are not comparable in all material respects since those consolidated financial statements report financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of these two separate entities. CCI’s fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired were recorded based upon their estimated fair values as of the closing date of the Acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.
 

Total Purchase Consideration: | 
--------------------------------------------+--
Common stock issued | $ | 770,000 
Estimated fair value of contingent payments | | 424,511 
 | $ | 1,194,511

 
The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired as of the date of Acquisition:
 

Net assets acquired: | 
----------------------------------------+--
Equipment | $ | 32,564 
Developed technology - website | | 117,500 
Developed technology – Ipad application | | 117,500 
Tradename | | 365,000 
Proprietary design | | 80,000 
Goodwill | | 481,947 
 | $ | 1,194,511

 
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain indicators are present.
 
Strategy
 
Reign Sapphires 
 
We set ourselves apart from our competition by actively promoting our three core offerings: a vertically integrated “source to retail” model for sapphires - rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires.
 
We promote Reign Sapphires as conflict free, ethically processed and natural. We also make video footage and pictures of the process available to consumers.
 
We focus primarily on quality and design and secondly on strategic pricing methods in order to compete in the U.S. market.
 
While all of our competitors have established themselves uniquely within sectors of the market, none have marketed themselves as source to consumer with a vertical integration of processing, cutting and shaping, manufacturing, and sales of sapphires. We believe there is a strong market opportunity for our products as there is currently growth in U.S. and global jewelry sales. We believe that we have the knowledge and expertise to capitalize on this opportunity and to capitalize upon the uniquely powerful internationally recognized Australian brand image and appeal and become the leading player in this fragmented cottage industry.

● | Packaging: Each jewelry item is accompanied by a high quality, durable jewelry box, gift bag, certificate of authenticity and warranty.

● | Our Reign Sapphire products feature sapphires that have been procured in the rough from commercial miners in New South Wales, Australia and processed by us. We do not have an exclusive supplier rather a number of commercial miners in the region that have been supplying the company with run-of-mine material for a number of years.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We do not rely on any principal suppliers and do not have any formal contracts with our suppliers. In the event that we are unable to conduct business on satisfactory terms with any of these suppliers, we believe that an extensive number of alternative sources will be available to us and that our business can continue without disruption or adverse change in terms of pricing and availability.

Competition 
 
Competitive Analysis and Strategy
 
The industry in which we compete is highly competitive. We believe that the most important competitive factors in our industry include the ability to control as much as possible of the supply chain.
 
We believe that our competitors have certain existing advantages such as history and heritage; strong ecommerce and mobile presence; wholesale and flagship retail presence; strong social presence; a wide range of ancillary product offerings; strong public relations and marketing efforts; a balanced range of price points across the board; and consumer trust & recognition. However, we set ourselves apart with strong brand identity and visuals, unique design and quality and brand awareness through traditional and social media.

Because we are a small company with a limited operating history, we are at a competitive disadvantage against larger and well-capitalized companies which have a track record of success and operations. Therefore, our primary method of competition involves promoting our direct to consumer offering.
 
We do not sell rough sapphires neither do we sell the cut stones that we process; we generally use the material exclusively for our manufacturing purposes. Wholesale revenues currently derived from sales of loose sapphires are attributable only to finished stones and not rough sapphires and the focus of our sales efforts in the future will be exclusively on finished jewelry.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Reign owns trademarks in the jewelry and gemstone class including “Reign”, “Reign Opulence”, “LeBloc”, “Coordinates Collection”, and “ION Collection”, and we also own a number of domain names.

However, there is a risk that we could be adversely affected by current laws, regulations or interpretations or that more restrictive laws, regulations or interpretations will be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive. There is also a risk that a change in current laws could adversely affect our business.
 
In addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, such regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority. Our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
Procurement and Manufacturing
 
At the present time, all of our manufacturing is conducted in the U.S. We have no formal contracts with our suppliers and manufacturers. In the event that we are unable to conduct business on satisfactory terms with any of these suppliers or manufacturers, we believe that an extensive number of alternative sources will be available to us and that our business can continue without disruption or adverse change in terms of pricing and availability.

Other than time spent researching our business and proposed markets and segmentation, we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date.
