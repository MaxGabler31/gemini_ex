Certain of the Company’s soft pretzels qualify under USDA regulations as the nutritional equivalent of bread for purposes of the USDA school lunch program, thereby enabling a participating school to obtain partial reimbursement of the cost of the Company’s soft pretzels from the USDA.
 
The Company’s soft pretzels are manufactured according to a proprietary formula. Soft pretzels, ranging in size from one to twenty-four ounces in weight, are shaped and formed by the Company’s twister machines. These soft pretzel tying machines are automated, high-speed machines for twisting dough into the traditional pretzel shape. Additionally, we make soft pretzels which are extruded or shaped by hand. Soft pretzels, after processing, are primarily quick-frozen in either raw or baked form and packaged for delivery.
 
The Company’s principal marketing program in the Food Service segment includes supplying ovens, mobile merchandisers, display cases, warmers and similar merchandising equipment to the retailer to prepare and promote the sale of soft pretzels. Some of this equipment is proprietary, including combination warmer and display cases that reconstitute frozen soft pretzels while displaying them, thus eliminating the need for an oven. The Company retains ownership of the equipment placed in customer locations, and as a result, customers are not required to make an investment in equipment.

Six of the ten customers in fiscal 2022 are food distributors who sell our product to many end users. The loss of one or more of our large customers could adversely affect our results of operations. These customers typically do not enter into long-term contracts and make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business. If receivables from one or more of these customers become uncollectible, our operating income would be adversely impacted.

Risks Associated with Foreign Operations
 
Foreign operations generally involve greater risk than doing business in the United States. Foreign economies differ favorably or unfavorably from the United States’ economy in such respects as the level of inflation and debt, which may result in fluctuations in the value of the country’s currency and real property. Sales of our foreign operations were $45.2 million, $20.8 million and $15.4 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At September 24, 2022, the total assets of our foreign operations were $42.7 million or 3.5% of total assets. At September 25, 2021, the total assets of our foreign operations were $25.0 million or 2.2% of total assets.
Government Regulation and Food Safety
 
Our business operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. As a producer of food products for human consumption, our operations are subject to stringent production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution standards, including regulations promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act. We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental protection laws. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations did not have a material effect upon the level of capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in fiscal 2022 and is not expected to have a material impact in fiscal 2023.
 
Our Food Safety & Quality (FSQA) personnel within our Compliance Department have broad, diverse academic and experience credentials and oversee all aspects of product safety & quality control across the Company. Our facilities are Global Food Safety Initiative (“GFSI”) certified and are audited annually by third party certification bodies. Our “Food Safety & Quality Plans” are validated and verified to ensure product safety and quality. We have implemented Corporate Standards which are aligned with GFSI, and routinely conduct audits to ensure compliance. We provide bi-weekly support calls for FSQA and Plant Leadership and annual Food Safety Summit Meetings to develop and strengthen our facility teams. As part of the onboarding process, and throughout their careers, FSQA employees are engaged in food safety discussions and trainings to provide safe, high-quality products to customers and consumers.

About 1,300 production and distribution employees throughout the Company are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company considers its culture and employee relations to be positive.
Employee Safety
 
We maintain a safety culture grounded on the premise of eliminating workplace incidents, risks and hazards.
