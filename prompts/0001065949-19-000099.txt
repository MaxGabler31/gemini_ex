CORPORATE OVERVIEW AND HISTORY OF CANNA CORPORATION (FORMERLY MINING POWER GROUP, INC.)
 We were incorporated on July 29, 2013 under the laws of the state of Florida. Originally Rich Cigars, Inc. was established to manufacture and distribute cigars under the Rich Cigars brand name. The Company continually sought to create cigars that appealed to aficionados of high-quality, hand-rolled, premium cigars. One of the founders, Alfred Rushing, has been involved with the cigar industry for more than 20 years. The Company intended to introduce new styles of premium cigars, contracted with a Nicaraguan supplier for the manufacture of hand rolled cigars, which would be distributed and sold principally in the U.S. However, as the consolidated financial statements of the Company for fiscal year 2017 demonstrated, the Company has not been successful in generating adequate revenues in order to generate a net profit or a positive cashflow.
 As the result of a change of control of the Company on November 27, 2017, it was decided to wind down the cigar business over the following months and have the Company enter into new, unrelated business areas. Until the new business strategies are ready for implementation, and a new management team engaged, Richard Davis, sole officer and director of the Company, was retained on an interim basis.
 On May 10, 2018, Yaniv Nahon assumed the CEO position and Richard Davis resigned. On July 31, 2018, Dror Svorai, controlling shareholder assumed the CEO position from Yaniv Nahon and Yaniv Nahon resigned.
 As a result of the change in business, the Company redomiciled from Florida to Colorado and in doing so, changed its name to “Intercontinental Technology, Inc.” Under advice of counsel, on December 26, 2017, the Company, re-domiciled to Delaware under the terms and conditions of a Section 251(g) reorganization under Delaware General Corporation law (the “Reorganization”), and future adjusted its name to “First Intercontinental Technology, Inc.” due the unavailability of the name “Intercontinental Technology, Inc.” in the State of Delaware. The Reorganization was subsequently annulled and vitiated by the Company in February 2018, and the Company returned to Colorado under the name “Mining Power Group, Inc.” and filed amended and restated Articles of Incorporation (collectively, the “February Corporate Changes”). The February Corporate Changes were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K on February 26, 2018.
 On February 2018, the Company announced that it would enter into cryptomining business. “Cryptomining” is the fundamental methodology of earning and/or creating digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and others, through the use of dedicated, specialized mining machines that perform complex mathematical functions to mine a cryptocurrency and also process cryptocurrency transactions. These machines operate 24-hours per day, 7-days per week within mining-dedicated, temperature-controlled server centers that provide complete end-to-end technical and other support for “peace of mind” and uninterrupted operation.
 As a result of this change, the Company renamed itself “Mining Power Group, Inc.” to accentuate the strategy. At the time of this filing 2018 on Form 10-K, the Company is exploring additional revenue-generating opportunities.
 As the Company entered 2018, its legacy cigar business was discontinued as it focused its efforts in the new areas with its remaining inventory being liquidated.
 On August 1, 2018, the Company entered into an acquisition agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) to acquire the majority ownership interest of Northway Mining, LLC (“Northway”). a New York limited liability company, located at 707 Flats Road, Athens, New York. Northway is a cryptomining data center hosting third-party owned and operated cryptomining machines within its 5000 square feet facility. It currently is hosting several hundred machines in its facilities at 2 Flint Mine Rd., under individual service agreements with third-party machine owners.
 Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement the Company acquired fifty-five percent (55%) of the ownership units of Northway in return for an investment of $1,100,000 (U.S.) for the purposes of providing working capital and funds to Northway for improvements to, and expansion of, its facilities, and the purchase of 30-acres of flat land and buildings at its Athens, New York address owned by a third party per that separate “Agreement for Purchase of Property between Northway Mining, LLC and CSX4236 Motorcycle Salvage LLC” (the “Land Purchase Agreement”). (The

“Acquisition”) Under the terms and conditions of the Acquisition, Northway has amended and restated its New York State limited liability company Operating Agreement under which it is stated that it will maintain its current management.
 On April 4, 2019, the Company effected a name change in the State of Colorado from Mining Power Group, Inc. to “Canna Corporation” in preparation for a refocus of its business plan.  Similarly, the name change was filed in the State of Florida, where the Company’s headquarters are located.
 EMPLOYEES
 During 2018, the Company had up to three consultants including our current officer and sole director Dror Svorai, under hourly oral consulting agreements. The existing personnel in Northway Mining, LLC., was laid-off and there are no employees at this time.
 Other than the current officer and director, the Company does not have a written employment agreement with its officer and director at this time.
 Our officer and director is responsible for planning, development and operational duties. The Company has no intention of hiring additional employees until it has sufficient, reliable revenue from our operations or supplemental third-party financing to support its new business direction.
 REPORT TO SECURITIES HOLDERS
 We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders. We will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are subject to disclosure filing requirements including filing Form 10K annually and Form 10Q quarterly. In addition, we will file Form 8K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required. We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, ("SEC"), at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY AND THE BUSINESS
 OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY
 There can be no assurance that our management will be successful in its attempts to implement the our business plan, build the corporate infrastructure required to support operations at the levels called for by our business plan or that we will generate sufficient revenues to meet expenses or to achieve or maintain profitability. We will encounter risks and difficulties that companies at a similar stage of development frequently experience, including the potential failure to:

· | Obtain sufficient working capital to support our establishment and expansion;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Find and realize the asset management opportunities required to generate revenue;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain adequate control of our expenses allowing us to realize anticipated income growth; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Anticipate and adapt to changing conditions in the tobacco products industry resulting from changes in government
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | regulations, mergers and acquisitions involving our competitors, technological developments and other significant
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | competitive and market dynamics.
--+---------------------------------

OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS LIMITED EXPERIENCE OPERATING A PUBLIC COMPANY. ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY OR ADEQUATELY COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO FINES OR REGULATORY ACTIONS, WHICH MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
 Members of our management team have limited experience managing and operating a public company and may rely in many instances on the professional experience and advice of third parties including its attorneys and accountants. Failure to comply or adequately comply with any federal or state securities laws, rules, or regulations may result in fines or regulatory actions, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operation, or financial condition and could result in delays in achieving either the effectiveness of a registration statement relating to the Securities being sold in this Offering or the development of an active and liquid trading market for our common stock.
WE ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITION
 The Company operates in a highly competitive environment, in the United States and if the case may be, internationally. The data-center industry is characterized by intense competition, based primarily on energy availability, credit availability, price, reliability of permanent operation, ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, safety, security measures, service and support.
 Weakness in demand, especially due to the fall in price on cryptocurrencies intensifies the competitive environment in which the Company operates. The Company competes with a variety of regional, national and international data-centers, some of which have greater financial resources than the Company. The Company also faces competition from companies entering or expanding worldwide installations based on less expensive energy and human resources costs.
 OUR PROFIT MARGINS ARE NARROW
 As a result of intense price competition in the industry, the Company has narrow gross profit and operating profit margins. These narrow margins magnify the impact on operating results of variations in sales and operating costs. Future gross profit and operating margins may be adversely affected by changes in product mix, vendor pricing actions and competitive and economic pressures. In addition, failure to attract new sources of business from expansion of products or services or entry into new markets may adversely affect future gross profit and operating margins.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VOLATILE, FLUCTUATING CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET
 After the highs of 2017, which saw the benchmark standard, Bitcoin, surge to $20,000, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency is currently trading close to its lowest point in 16 months. Bitcoin has fallen by almost 80% over the last year.
 There have been five major price spikes in Bitcoin's 10-year history, and after each previous crash the market has managed to recover to even higher levels. But the scale of the 2018 losses have left some cryptocurrency experts questioning whether Bitcoin will once again see a market turn-around.
 OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AS TO OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.
 The audited consolidated financial statements included in this 10-K have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result if we cease to continue as a going concern.
 We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We have funded these losses primarily through the sale of securities. Based on our financial history since inception, in their report on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We are a development stage company that had decreasing revenue. There is no assurance that any revenue will be realized in the future.
 There can be no assurance that we will have adequate capital resources to fund planned operations or that any additional funds will be available to us when needed or at all, or, if available, will be available on favorable terms or in amounts required by us.
 If we are unable to obtain adequate capital resources to fund operations, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our operations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ability to operate as a going concern.
 IF WE NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FUND OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL AND MAY BE FORCED TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF OUR OPERATIONS.
 If adequate additional financing is not available on reasonable terms, we may not be able to undertake sufficient sales and business development efforts required to identify clients and assist them with asset acquisitions, development of their real estate projects or management of existing stabilized assets, which may result in a negative impact to our cash flow and we would have to modify our business plans accordingly. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available to us.
 In connection with our growth strategies, we may experience increased capital needs and accordingly, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our future operations without additional capital investments. Our capital needs will depend on numerous factors, including (i) our profitability; (ii) the development of similar products undertaken by our competition; (iii) the level of our investment in sales and marketing; and (iv) the amount of our capital expenditures, including corporate acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain capital in the future to meet our needs.
 In recent years, the securities markets in the United States have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations, performances, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. For these reasons, our common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control.
 If we are not able to obtain additional funding, we may be required to: (i) limit our expansion; (ii) limit our marketing efforts; and (iii) decrease or eliminate capital expenditures. Such reductions could materially adversely affect our business and our ability to compete.

-

Even if we do find a source of additional capital, we may not be able to negotiate terms and conditions for receiving the additional capital that are favorable to us. Any future capital investments could dilute or otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing shareholders. In addition, new equity or convertible debt securities issued by us to obtain financing could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to the Shares. We cannot give you any assurance that any additional financing will be available to us, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us.
 SHAREHOLDERS WILL EXPERIENCE DILUTION OF THEIR OWNERSHIP INTEREST BECAUSE OF THE FUTURE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.
 If we raise additional capital subsequent to hereto through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, we may also have to issue securities that may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. In the event we seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or its equivalents, this will result in increased interest expense.
WE WILL DEPEND UPON MANAGEMENT BUT WE MAY AT TIMES HAVE LIMITED PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT.
 Our sole director, Mr. Dror Svorai, is also acting as our sole officer of Canna Corporation, and Mr. Michael Maranda is acting as a sole officer of our subsidiary, Northway Mining. During 2018 Mr. Maranda was accompanied by Mr. Ryan Lehmann as CFO of Northway, but Mr. Lehmann resigned in September 2018. We will be heavily dependent upon Mr. Svorai’s and Mr. Maranda’s skills, talents, and abilities, as well as several consultants, to implement our business plan. It is possible that our officers and consultants may not be able to devote their full-time attention to our business, which may result in a delay in the progress toward implementing our business plan. Consultants may be employed on a part-time basis under a contract to be determined.
 Our officers may become, in thier individual capacity, officers, directors, controlling shareholders and/or partner sof other entities engaged in a variety of businesses. Thus, our officers may have potential conflicts including their time and efforts involved in participation with other business entities.
 We do not know of any reason other than outside business interests that would prevent our officers
 from devoting full-time to our Company, when the business may demand such full-time participation.
 WE WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON KEY PERSONNEL FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
 We will be dependent on several key members of its management and operations teams for the foreseeable future. In particular, we have been and remain dependent on Dror Svorai as our President. The loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on our operations and prospects. At this time, we have no employment agreements with any individuals, though it is contemplated that the Company may in the future enter into such agreements with certain of its key employees on terms and conditions usual and customary for its industry. We do not currently have any "key man" life insurance on any employees or our officer.
WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING.
 We are highly dependent on the infusion of additional capital through other private placements or loans supporting ongoing operations and expansion. If we are not successful in obtaining additional capital it could be necessary to seek additional financing elsewhere or to materially curtail our expansion plans. There can be no assurance that such other financing would be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all. Failure to obtain such financing could materially impair our ability to increase sales and achieve profitability.

WE ARE AN “EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY,” AND ANY DECISION ON OUR PART TO COMPLY ONLY WITH CERTAIN REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO “EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES” COULD MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS.
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an “emerging growth company,” we expect and fully intend to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)2(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to opt in to the extended transition period for complying with the revised accounting standards. We have elected to rely on these exemptions and reduced disclosure requirements applicable to “emerging growth companies” and expect to continue to do so.
 THE JOBS ACT ALLOWS US TO DELAY THE ADOPTION OF NEW OR REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTIVE DATES FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPANIES.
 Since, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act, this election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
BECAUSE OUR COMMON STOCK IS NOT REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, OUR REPORTING OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, MAY BE SUSPENDED AUTOMATICALLY IF WE HAVE FEWER THAN 300 SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON THE FIRST DAY OF OUR FISCAL YEAR.
 Our common stock is not registered under the Exchange Act, and we do not intend to register our common stock under the Exchange Act for the foreseeable future (provided that, we will register our common stock under the Exchange Act if we have, after the last day of our fiscal year, $10,000,000 in total assets and either more than 2,000 shareholders of record or 500 shareholders of record who are not accredited investors (as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission), in accordance with Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act). As long as our common stock is not registered under the Exchange Act, our obligation to file reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act will be automatically suspended if, on the first day of any fiscal year (other than a fiscal year in which a registration statement under the Securities Act has gone effective), we have fewer than 300 shareholders of record. This suspension is automatic and does not require any filing with the SEC. In such an event, we may cease providing periodic reports and current or periodic information, including operational and financial information, may not be available with respect to our results of operations.

OUR BYLAWS PROVIDE FOR INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AT OUR EXPENSE AND LIMIT THEIR LIABILITY WHICH MAY RESULT IN A MAJOR COST TO US AND HURT THE INTERESTS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS BECAUSE CORPORATE RESOURCES MAY BE EXPENDED FOR THE BENEFIT OF OFFICERS AND/OR DIRECTORS.
 Our Bylaws include provisions that eliminate the personal liability of the directors of the Company for monetary damages to the fullest extent possible under the laws of the State of Florida or other applicable law. These provisions eliminate the liability of directors to the Company and its stockholders for monetary damages arising out of any violation of a director of his fiduciary duty of due care. Under Florida law, however, such provisions do not eliminate the personal liability of a director for (i) breach of the director’s duty of loyalty, (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, (iii) payment of dividends or repurchases of stock other than from lawfully available funds, or (iv) any transaction from which the director derived an improper benefit. These provisions do not affect a director’s liabilities under the federal securities laws or the recovery of damages by third parties.
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, INCLUDING ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ACCEPTABLE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ARE COSTLY AND MAY INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY.
 The rules and regulations of the SEC require a public company to prepare and file periodic reports under the Exchange Act, which will require that the Company engage legal, accounting, auditing and other professional services. The engagement of such services is costly. Additionally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) requires, among other things, that we design, implement and maintain adequate internal controls and procedures over financial reporting. The costs of complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the limited technically qualified personnel we have may make it difficult for us to design, implement and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting. In the event that we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may not be able to produce reliable financial reports or report fraud, which may harm our overall financial condition and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our share price.
 We are working with our legal, accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. These areas include corporate governance, corporate control, disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. However, we anticipate that the expenses that will be required in order to adequately prepare for being a public company could be material. We estimate that the aggregate cost of increased legal services; accounting and audit functions; personnel, such as a chief financial officer familiar with the obligations of public company reporting; consultants to design and implement internal controls; and financial printing alone will be a few hundred thousand dollars per year and could be several hundred thousand dollars per year. In addition, if and when we retain independent directors and/or additional members of senior management, we may incur additional expenses related to director compensation and/or premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, the costs of which we cannot estimate at this time. We may also incur additional expenses associated with investor relations and similar functions, the cost of which we also cannot estimate at this time. However, these additional expenses individually, or in the aggregate, may also be material.
 In addition, being a public company could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.

The increased costs associated with operating as a public company may decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may cause us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services to offset the effect of such increased costs. Additionally, if these requirements divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE WHICH COULD IMPACT THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE COMPANY.
 From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
 Litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in future cases.
 OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE OR THIRD-PARTY INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER OUR LEGAL CLAIMS OR OTHER LOSSES THAT WE MAY INCUR IN THE FUTURE.
 In the future, insurance coverage may not be available at adequate levels or on adequate terms to cover potential losses, including on terms that meet our customer’s requirements. If insurance coverage is inadequate or unavailable, we may face claims that exceed coverage limits or that are not covered, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results.
IF DEVELOPED, OUR BRANDS MAY BECOME VALUABLE, AND ANY INABILITY TO PROTECT THEM COULD REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR BRANDS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.
 We may invest significant resources to build and protect our brands, products and services. However, we may be unable or unwilling to strictly enforce our intellectual property rights from infringement. Our failure to enforce such rights could diminish the value of our brands, products and services and harm our business and future growth prospects.
A SHORTAGE IN THE SUPPLY OF KEY DIRECT COST COMPONENTS AND SERVICES COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES AND REVENUES.
 Going forward, all of our direct cost components and services are obtained from third-party suppliers. Shortages in energy supply or price increases, or difficulties on purchasing materials used in the mining equipment could result in materially higher prices or adversely affect our ability to have our services rendered.
 Price increases from a supplier would directly affect our profitability if we are not able to pass price increases on to customers.
 Our inability to obtain adequate energy in a timely manner or a material increase in the price of energy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
 Certain conflicts of interest may exist between our Company and our officer and director. He may have other business interests to which he devotes attention and may be expected to continue to do so although management time should be devoted to the business of our Company. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise that can be resolved only through exercise of such judgment as is consistent with fiduciary duties to our Company.
LIMITED REVENUE HISTORY.
 Our Company is considered in development stage. Our Company must be regarded as a new or development venture with all of the unforeseen costs, expenses, problems, risks and difficulties to which such ventures are subject.

10
--

NO ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS OR PROFITABILITY.
 There is no assurance that our Company will ever operate profitably. There is no assurance that we will generate profits, or that the value of our Company’s Shares will be increased thereby.
LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION.
 Because of the limited financial resources that we have, it is unlikely that we will be able to diversify our operations. Our probable inability to diversify our activities into more than one area will subject us to economic fluctuations within our business or industry and therefore increase the risks associated with our operations.
DEPENDENCE UPON OUTSIDE ADVISORS.
 To supplement the business experience of our officer and director, we may be required to employ accountants, technical experts, appraisers, attorneys, or other consultants or advisors. Our Company’s management, without any input from stockholders, will make the selection of any such advisors. Furthermore, it is anticipated that such persons may be engaged on an “as needed” basis without a continuing fiduciary or other obligation to our Company. In the event our Company considers it necessary to hire outside advisors, they may elect to hire persons who are affiliates, if they are able to provide the required services.
 Based on our current cash reserves, we will have relatively small operational budget for the operations that we cannot expand without additional raising capital.
 If we are unable to begin to generate enough revenue to cover our operational costs, we will need to seek additional sources of funds. Currently, we have no committed source for any funds as of date hereof. No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed. In the event funds cannot be raised if and when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan and could fail in business as a result of these uncertainties.
 We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to raise enough capital to fund acquisitions and product development.
 We will need to raise additional funds to support not only our budget, but also our expansion operations. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to raise such funds or whether we would be able to raise such funds with terms that are favorable to us. We may seek to borrow monies from lenders at commercial rates, but such lenders will probably be at higher than bank rates, which higher rates could, depending on the amount borrowed, make the net operating income insufficient to cover the interest.
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK
 WE MAY IN THE FUTURE ISSUE MORE SHARES WHICH COULD CAUSE A LOSS OF CONTROL BY OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT AND CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS.
 We may issue further shares as consideration for the cash or assets or services out of our authorized but unissued common stock that would, upon issuance, represent a majority of the voting power and equity of our Company. The result of such an issuance would be those new stockholders and management would control our Company, and persons unknown could replace our management at this time. Such an occurrence would result in a greatly reduced percentage of ownership of our Company by our current shareholders, which could present significant risks to investors.
WE HAVE NOT AND MAY NEVER PAY ANY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS.
 We have not paid dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate.

A LIMITED PUBLIC MARKET EXISTS FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AT THIS TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF A FUTURE MARKET.
 
Our common stock has been quoted on the OTC Pink since November 16, 2016, under the symbol “MPGR.” There is a limited public market for our common stock, and no assurance can be given that a market will continue or that a shareholder ever will be able to liquidate his investment without considerable delay, if at all. If a market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Factors such as those discussed in the “Risk Factors” section may have a significant impact upon the market price of the shares offered hereby. Due to the low price of our securities, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in our securities. Even if a purchaser finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in our shares, the combination of brokerage commissions, state transfer taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of our shares as collateral for any loans.
OUR COMMON STOCK IS CONSIDERED A PENNY STOCK, WHICH MAY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETABILITY, SO YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SHARES.
 We may be subject now and in the future to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules if our shares of common stock sell below $5.00 per share. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to completing the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation.
 In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction, the broker dealer must make a special written
 determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. The penny stock rules are burdensome and may reduce purchases of any offerings and reduce the trading activity for shares of our common stock. As long as our shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules, the holders of such shares of common stock may find it more difficult to sell their securities.
 In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a number of rules to regulate “penny stocks”.
 Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because our securities constitute “penny stocks” within the meaning of the rules, the rules would apply to us and to our securities. The rules will further affect the ability of owners of shares to sell our securities in any market that might develop for them because it imposes additional regulatory burdens on penny stock transactions.
 Shareholders should be aware that, according to Securities and Exchange Commission, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) “boiler room” practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired consequent investor losses.
 Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market,

management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities.
 RULE 144 SALES IN THE FUTURE MAY HAVE A DEPRESSIVE EFFECT ON OUR STOCK PRICE.
 Our shareholders may be able to use Rule 144 as an exemption for resale, but resales under Rule 144 could have a depressive effect on the market-trading price, if any. Investors will have no effective way to combat this.
OUR SHARES ARE THINLY TRADED.
 The shares of our common stock may continue to be thinly-traded on the OTC Markets under the symbol MPGR, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven, early stage company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of any of our Securities until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our Securities is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on Securities price.
 We cannot give you any assurance that an active public trading market for our common Securities will ever develop or be sustained, or that any trading levels will be sustained. Due to these conditions, we can give investors no assurance that they will be able to sell their shares at or any prices or at all if they need money or otherwise desire to liquidate their securities of our Company. Our common stock may not be able to be liquidated at or near ask prices in any volume in the markets.
 OUR COMMON STOCK MARKET PRICES MAY BE VOLATILE, WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES THE RISK THAT INVESTORS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES AT OR ABOVE THE PRICE THAT WAS PAID FOR THE SECURITY.
 Because of the limited trading market for our common stock and because of the possible price volatility, shareholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock when desired. The inability to sell common stock in a rapidly declining market may substantially increase the risk of loss because of such illiquidity and because the price for our common stock may suffer greater declines because of our price volatility. Certain factors, some of which are beyond our control, that may cause our share price to fluctuate significantly include, but are not limited to the following:

· | Variations in our quarterly operating results;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | Loss of a key relationship or failure to complete significant transactions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Additions or departures of key personnel; and
--+----------------------------------------------


· | Fluctuations in stock market price and volume.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 Additionally, in recent years the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In some cases, these fluctuations are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the underlying company. These market factors may materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of those companies common stock. If we become involved in this type of litigation in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could have a further negative effect on shareholders’ investments in our stock.

FUTURE DILUTION MAY OCCUR DUE TO ISSUANCES OF SHARES FOR VARIOUS CONSIDERATION IN THE FUTURE.
 There may be substantial dilution to our shareholders as a result of future decisions of the Board to issue shares without shareholder approval for cash, services, acquisitions, or pursuant to any future Employee/Consultant Stock Option Plan.
OUR NEW INVESTORS WILL SUFFER A DISPROPORTIONATE RISK AND THERE WILL BE IMMEDIATE DILUTION OF PURCHASERS’ INVESTMENTS.
 Our present shareholders have acquired their securities at a cost that may be significantly less than that which future investors will pay for their stock holdings, or at which future purchasers in the market may pay. Therefore, new investors may bear most of the risk of loss.
OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND THE INVESTMENT IS THEREFORE HIGHLY RISKY.
 Due to the speculative nature of our business, it is probable that the investment in shares offered hereby will result in a total loss to the investor. Investors should be able to financially bear the loss of their entire investment. Investment should, therefore, be limited to that portion of discretionary funds not needed for normal living purposes or for reserves for disability and retirement.
POTENTIAL CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND/OR TAXATION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.
 We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. New accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. Increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after tax income. Equally, increases in indirect taxes could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales.
WE WILL RELY ON THIRD PARTIES FOR SERVICES IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS AND ANY DISRUPTION OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.
 We will have contracts with third parties. If these relationships are disrupted for any reason our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected.
REPORTING INFORMATION.
 Our Company is subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, shareholders will have ready access to the information required to be reported by publicly held companies under the Securities and Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder. Our Company intends to provide our shareholders with annual reports containing financial information prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as required by Sec. 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
LIMITED FINANCING – LACK OF LOAN AVAILABILITY.
 The monies currently on hand may not be sufficient for the continued expanded operations of our Company. There is no assurance that additional monies or financing will be available in the future or, if available, will be at terms favorable to our Company. (See “Business Summary”)
 Our Company may borrow money to finance its operations on terms to be determined. Any such borrowing will increase the risk of loss to the investor in the event our Company is unsuccessful in repaying such loans.
 
CAPITAL RESOURCES.
 The only capital resources of our Company are our shares.
