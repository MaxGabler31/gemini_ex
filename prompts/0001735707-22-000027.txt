Item 1. Business
Our Company
Garrett designs, manufactures and sells highly engineered turbocharger and electric-boosting technologies for light and commercial vehicle original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and the global vehicle independent aftermarket as well as automotive software solutions. These OEMs, in turn, ship to consumers globally. We are a global technology leader with significant expertise in delivering products for internal combustion engines using gasoline, diesel, natural gas and electrified powertrains (hybrid and fuel cell). Additionally, we are currently in the development stage of turbochargers for internal combustion engines using producing hydrogen as fuel. These products are key enablers for fuel economy and emissions standards compliance. 
The turbocharger industry is expected to increase from approximately 44 million units in 2021 to approximately 55 million units by 2026, according to IHS Markit (“IHS”) for light vehicle and Knibb, Gormezano and Partners ("KGP") and Power Systems Research ("PSR") for commercial vehicle on-highway and off-highway. The turbocharger industry growth is mainly driven by an expected increase in the penetration of hybrid vehicles, from 10 million hybrid cars globally in 2021 to an anticipated 31 million hybrid cars globally in 2026. 
In 2021, a significant increase in battery electric vehicle (“BEV”) sales has been observed in Europe and China, with BEV representing, respectively, 6% and 11% of vehicles sold. In China, renewed sales incentives, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, as well as non-financial incentives such as more generous license-plate quotas for major metropolitan areas, have bolstered Chinese BEV penetration. In Europe, the COVID-19 stimulus packages are mostly directed to electric vehicles, as well as sales mix management by OEMs to achieve their fleet average CO2 targets which are supporting BEV penetration. The Company acknowledges that short-term, selling price, charging time, charging infrastructure availability and profitability issues for OEMs remain challenges to adoption. In the long-term, the revision of CO2 reduction targets by 2030 proposed by the E.U. could drive a further increase of BEV penetration in Europe beyond currently forecasted levels. In the United States of America ("US" or "United States"), the tightening of CO2/mileage targets is expected to drive higher turbo penetration in the short to medium-term. The President of the United States signed an executive order with the goal of making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles, which is expected to accelerate the electrification trend in the mid-to-long term. Garrett's portfolio for hybrid powertrains includes new electric boosting solutions that leverage our unique technologies for electrical high speed turbo machinery. Garrett's product portfolio also includes fuel cell compressors for which we are currently designing the third generation and we are well positioned to take advantage of growing opportunities especially in the application of commercial vehicles. In China, the roadmap released by the China Society of Automotive Engineers, Energy-saving and New Energy Vehicle Technology Roadmap 2.0, outlines a technology path for the next ten years that aims to find a balance between fuel consumption improvement for hybrids and the introduction of electric vehicles. In that context, the turbocharger industry is expected to keep contributing to fuel economy optimization of both conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles as well as hybrid vehicles.
In the short to medium term, we believe that turbocharger demand will grow as turbochargers remain one of the most cost-efficient levers to improve the fuel efficiency of conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles as well as hybrid vehicles. In 2021, Garrett won the prestigious Automotive News PACE™ award for the industry's first E-turbo to be launched in 2022. The unique high speed electric motor technology developed for this product provides synergistic opportunities for additional electric offerings like fuel cell compressors that are required by fuel cell vehicles. Additionally, this technology also offers opportunities for new products to support all types of electrified drivetrains. In the commercial vehicle industry, we expect a slower transition to BEVs due to specific mission profile and associated range and charging time constraints, which translates into more resilient turbocharger demand, as most commercial vehicles are turbocharged. In addition, low or zero emission alternative fuels for internal combustion engines ("ICE"), like natural gas or hydrogen, are expected to gain momentum in coming years, supporting continued turbocharger demand. Growth in the turbocharger industry is expected in all regions, with special mention for high-growth regions in Asia, where rising income levels continue to drive long-term automotive and vehicle component demand. While these positive factors do not isolate the turbocharger industry from fluctuations in global vehicle production volumes, such factors may mitigate the negative impact of macroeconomic cycles. In addition, approximately 30% of our revenues come from commercial vehicle applications and aftermarket sales that are less sensitive to the trend of electrification.
Emergence from Chapter 11
On September 20, 2020 (the “Petition Date”), the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) each filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors’ chapter 11 cases (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) were jointly administered under the caption “In re: Garrett Motion Inc., 20-12212.” On April 20, 2021, the Debtors filed the Revised Amended Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”). On April 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) among other things, confirming the Plan. On April 30, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), the conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived and the Company emerged from bankruptcy. 
We emerged from bankruptcy with a new board of directors, new equity owners and a significantly improved financial position. Under the Plan, among other things, all of our outstanding pre-emergence indebtedness under our credit facilities and senior notes was cancelled. At emergence, we entered into new secured credit facilities consisting of a $715 million term loan, a €450 million term loan and a $300 million revolving credit facility. Our post-emergence capital structure also included the issuance of $1,301 million of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock with a net present value of $585 million. For more detailed information regarding our emergence from Chapter 11, see Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Emergence from Chapter 11 and Note 2, Plan of Reorganization of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Macroeconomic disruptions
The global COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the semiconductor shortage, are creating uncertainty across multiple industries, including the automotive industry. Supply-side constraints, in particular, will keep influencing our operating activity throughout 2022 as well. Automotive OEMs have reduced production plans in the first two quarters of 2022. The Company is currently reviewing production levels at OEM plants and is closely monitoring supply-chain disruptions related to semiconductor shortages in an effort to minimize the impact of the bottleneck in supply and to mitigate any potential disruption in production. In addition, our business uses substantial amounts of energy in production, and our production activities may therefore be impacted by power outages in the places where we produce or source our products, such as China. As of December 31, 2021, Garrett plants in China have not experienced power outage impacts at our own production facilities. However, reduced supplier capacity may not meet our demands, and we may also encounter demand reduction from customers or power cuts in our own plants going forward. Any power outage impacts are closely monitored. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, the global economy has experienced an increased risk of shortages and other disruptions to global supply chains, including as a result of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic, despite vaccination campaigns, drives new lockdown measures impacting our manufacturing facilities, our facilities may be forced to shut down or operate at reduced capacity again. Additional or continued facility closures or reductions in operations could significantly reduce our production volumes and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See "- Risks Relating to our Business - Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities." and "- The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is expected to further adversely impact our business and results of operations." in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report.
Analyst consensus for the full year 2021 estimates growth of approximately 2% in global light vehicle production and approximately 4% increase in commercial vehicle production. As a result, a slight decrease for the combined light and commercial vehicle turbocharger industry volume occurred in 2021. In 2022, 9% growth is expected for light vehicle production and commercial vehicles are expected to grow at 3%. We have prepared contingency plans for multiple scenarios that we believe will allow us to react swiftly to changes in customer demand while protecting Garrett’s long-term growth potential. The supplies needed for our operations were generally available throughout 2021. In limited circumstances, certain suppliers experienced financial distress during 2021, resulting in supply disruptions. However, during 2021, we implemented new procedures for monitoring of supplier risks associated with COVID-19 and we believe we have substantially addressed such risks with manageable economic impacts including use of premium freight or adjusted payment terms that are limited in time. As the global supply chain restarts, it is possible that additional supply constraints will appear for the industry. In addition, we sustained cost control measures and cash management actions in 2021 including:
•Postponing capital expenditures;
•Optimizing working capital requirements;
•Lowering discretionary spending;
•Flexing organizational costs by implementing short-term working schemes;
•Reducing temporary workforce and contract service workers; and
•Restricting external hiring. 
The following charts show our percentage of revenues by geographic region and product line for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and the percentage change from the prior year comparable period.

Our Industry
We currently compete in the global turbocharger industry for gasoline, diesel and natural gas engines, in the electric-boosting industry for electrified (hybrid and fuel cell) vehicle powertrains and in the emerging connected vehicle software industry. As vehicles become more electrified, our electric-boosting products use principles similar to our turbochargers to further optimize air intake and thus further enhance performance, fuel economy and exhaust emissions with the help of an integrated high-speed electric motor. By using a turbocharger or electric-boosting technology, an OEM can deploy smaller, lighter powertrains with better fuel economy and exhaust emissions while delivering the same power and acceleration as larger, heavier powertrains. As such, turbochargers have become one of the most highly effective technologies for helping global OEMs meet increasingly stricter emission standards. At the same time, we have developed unique technological competencies, which we aim to continue leveraging to solve our customers’ energy related challenges in the electrification evolution related to ICE, hybrids and electric powertrains. We are developing solutions and increasing our research and development ("R&D") spend, focusing more than 40% of total R&D expenditure on new technologies like the Garrett E-Turbo that was recognized with the 2021 Automotive News PACE™ award for superior innovation, technological advancement and business performance among automotive suppliers. We are also continuing to develop Model Predictive Controls (MPC) algorithms and cybersecurity software solutions that leverage our knowledge of vehicle powertrains and experience working closely with OEM manufacturers. 
Global Turbocharger Industry
The global turbocharger industry includes turbochargers for new light and commercial vehicles as well as turbochargers for replacement use in the global aftermarket. According to IHS, KGP and PSR, the global turbocharger industry consisted of approximately 44 million unit sales with an estimated total value of approximately $10 billion in 2021. Within the global turbocharger industry, light vehicles accounted for approximately 84% of total unit volume and commercial vehicles accounted for the remaining 16%.
IHS, KGP and PSR project that the turbocharger production volume will grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% from 2021 through 2026, driven mainly by turbochargers for light vehicle gasoline engines and continued slow growth for commercial vehicles, offset by a decline in diesel turbochargers given a decline in diesel powertrains, particularly for light vehicles. This annual sales estimate would add approximately 314 million new turbocharged vehicles on the road globally between 2021 and 2026.
Key trends affecting our industry
Current global economic conditions due to COVID-19 have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect many industries including the Automotive sector. Chip shortages and rising raw material prices also had significant impacts on the automotive industry, making it unable to serve the recovery in demand. Consequently, IHS reduced its light vehicle production volume forecast for 2022 from 88 million units that they forecasted in 2020 to 83 million units in their January 2022 light vehicle industry production volume forecast. While this resets the volume outlook for the automotive industry, the underlying growth drivers for the turbocharger industry remain unchanged: Growth in the overall vehicle industry (albeit from a lower base), increasingly tight fuel efficiency and emission standards, and growing turbocharger penetration (especially in gas light vehicles).
Growth in overall vehicle production. After a decrease of 16% in Light Vehicle production and 5% in Commercial Vehicle production in 2020, a partial recovery was expected in 2021. After a strong start, the automotive industry was strongly hit by the impact of COVID-19 waves and supply chain disruptions, in particular semiconductor shortages. Because of that, vehicle production in 2021 ended up almost flat vs 2020, despite a strong pent up demand. For 2022, considering this pent up demand and very low levels of inventory, especially in Europe and US, IHS, KGP and PSR expect a 9% growth in light vehicle ("LV") production and a 3% growth in commercial vehicle ("CV") production. However, significant uncertainty level remains with further COVID-19 waves, continued supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions. The shift from pure gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines to hybridized powertrains is expected to 
continue in response to increasingly strict fuel efficiency and regulatory standards. In parallel, the share of pure electric vehicles is expected to continue to increase from a low base as technology and supporting infrastructure continue to improve. 
Global vehicle fuel efficiency and emissions standards. OEMs are facing increasingly strict constraints for vehicle fuel efficiency and emissions standards globally. Regulatory authorities in key vehicle regions such as the United States, the European Union, China, Japan, and Korea have instituted regulations that require sustained and significant reductions in greenhouse gas (including CO2 and NOx) and particulate matter vehicle emissions. OEMs are required to evaluate and adopt various solutions to address these stricter standards. Turbochargers allow OEMs to reduce engine size without sacrificing vehicle performance, thereby increasing fuel efficiency and decreasing harmful emissions. Furthermore, turbochargers allow more precise “air control” over both engine intake and exhaust conditions such as gas pressures, flows and temperatures, enabling optimization of the combustion process. This combustion optimization is critical to engine efficiency, exhaust emissions, power and transient response and enables such concepts as exhaust gas recirculation for diesel engines and Miller-cycle operation for gasoline engines. Consequently, we believe turbocharging will continue to be a key technology for automakers to meet future tough fuel economy and emissions standards without sacrificing performance.
Turbocharger penetration. The utilization of turbochargers and electric-boosting technologies on vehicle powertrain systems is one of the most cost-effective solutions to address stricter standards, and OEMs are increasing their adoption of these technologies. IHS, KGP and PSR expect total turbocharger penetration to increase globally from approximately 44 million units in 2021 to approximately 55 million units by 2026. IHS forecasts particularly strong turbocharger penetration growth for gasoline turbochargers, expecting an increase on light vehicles from approximately 43% in 2021 to 54% in 2026.
Medium-Term Powertrain Trends
Note - Years 2019 - 2021 represent actual data and years 2022 - 2026 represent forecasted data. 
Source: IHS, KGP, PSR
Engine size and complexity. In order to address stricter fuel economy standards, OEMs have used turbochargers to reduce the average engine size on their vehicles over time without compromising performance. Stricter pollutants emissions standards (primarily for NOx and particulates) have driven higher turbocharger adoption as well, which we believe will continue in the future, with a predicted total automotive turbocharger sales volume CAGR of 4% between 
2021 and 2026, in an industry with a predicted total automobile sales volume CAGR of approximately 5% over the same period, in each case according to IHS, KGP and PSR. In addition, increasingly demanding fuel economy standards require continuous increases in turbocharger technology content (e.g., variable geometry, electronic actuation, multiple stages, ball bearings, electrical control, etc.) which results in steady increases in average turbocharger content per vehicle.
Electrification. To address stricter fuel economy standards, OEMs also have been increasing the electrification of their vehicle offerings, primarily with the addition of hybrid vehicles, which have powertrains equipped with a gasoline or diesel internal combustion engine in combination with an electric motor. IHS estimates that hybrid vehicles produced globally will grow from a total of approximately 10.3 million vehicles in 2021 to 30.6 million vehicles by 2026, representing a CAGR of 24%. The electrified powertrain of hybrid vehicles enables the usage of highly synergistic electric-boosting technologies which augment standard turbochargers with electrically assisted boosting and electrical-generation capability. Furthermore, the application of electric boosting extends the requirement for engineering collaboration with OEMs to include electrical integration, software controls, and advanced sensing. Overall, this move to electric boosting further increases the role and value of turbocharging in improving vehicle fuel economy and exhaust emissions.
Battery electric and fuel cell technologies. OEMs are investing in full battery-electric vehicles to comply with increasingly tight regulatory targets across regions. IHS, KGP and PSR expect that BEV will compose 19% of total light and commercial vehicle production globally by 2026. Consumer adoption hinges on future "cost of range”, tightly linked to the energy capacity of the battery, but also how well that energy is used. Energy efficiency increases (including how to best address thermal management challenges), battery price (and consequently vehicle price), weight reduction through increases in power density, and shorter recharging times are all critical problems to solve. As OEMs strive to solve these issues, they are increasing investment in hydrogen fuel cell powered electric vehicles for demanding applications requiring long range, especially in the commercial vehicle space. These vehicles, like battery electric vehicles, have fully electric motor powertrains, but they rely on the hydrogen fuel cell to generate the required electricity. The hydrogen fuel cell also requires advanced electric-boosting technology to run efficiently and optimize range and cost of ownership. We are investing to address selected challenges raised by the electrification trend, where our differentiated technology can bring benefits related to lighter, more compact and more energy efficient components for electric vehicles.
Connected vehicles, software and controls. In addition to powertrain evolution, the connected vehicle industry is growing rapidly. Our MPC algorithms, predictive maintenance, diagnostics and cybersecurity tools address this industry. We expect their adoption will increase as advanced driver assistance features increase requirements for vehicle functional safety. Simultaneously, our cybersecurity solutions protect those vehicles against outside interference to ensure correct functionality.
Vehicle ownership in China and other high-growth regions. Vehicle ownership in China and other emerging regions remains well below ownership levels in developed areas and will be a key driver of future vehicle production. At the same time, these regions are following the lead of developed countries by instituting stricter emission standards. Growth in production volume and greater penetration by large global OEMs in these regions, along with evolving emission standards and increasing fuel economy and vehicle performance demands, is driving increasing turbocharger penetration in high-growth regions.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that we differentiate ourselves through the following competitive strengths:
Global and broad industry leadership
We are a global leader in the $10 billion turbocharger industry. We believe we will continue to benefit from the increased adoption of turbochargers, as well as our global technology leadership, comprehensive portfolio, continuous product innovation and our deep-seated relationships with all global OEMs. We maintain a leadership position across all vehicle types, engine types and regions, including:
Light Vehicles
•Gasoline: The global adoption of turbochargers by OEMs on gasoline engines has increased rapidly from approximately 14% in 2013 to approximately 43% in 2021 and is forecasted by IHS to increase to 54% by 2026. In addition to the volume growth, tightening of CO2 regulations is driving a technology shift, moving away from standard waste gate technology to variable geometry turbo ("VNT") which is a premium technology that offers Garrett technological competitive advantages. In 2016, we launched the first high volume VNT gasoline application, and this technology is expected to experience a fast increase in adoption in years to come. 
According to forecast by IHS, VNT should represent 8% of global turbo gasoline production in 2024, with 23% in Europe and 4% in China. In 2026, forecasted penetration is 16% at global level, with 30% in Europe and 18% in China. Key to our strategy for gasoline growth is thus to leverage our technology strengths in high-temperature materials and variable geometry as well as our scale, global footprint and in-market capabilities to meet the volume demands of global OEMs.
•Diesel: We have a long history of technology leadership in diesel engine turbochargers. Despite diesel industry weakness for some vehicle segments, the majority of our diesel turbochargers revenue comes from heavier and bigger vehicles like SUVs, pickup trucks and light commercial vehicles (such as delivery vans), which remain a stable part of the diesel industry. Diesel maintains a unique advantage in terms of fuel consumption, hence cost of ownership, and towing capacity makes it still the powertrain of choice for heavier vehicle applications. Diesel also remains essential for OEMs to meet their CO2 fleet average regulatory target going forward, as diesel vehicles produce less CO2 on average than gasoline vehicles.
•Electrified vehicles. We provide a comprehensive portfolio of turbocharger and electric-boosting technologies to manufacturers of hybrid-electric and fuel cell vehicles. OEMs have increased their adoption of these electrified technologies given regulatory standards and consumer demands driving an expected CAGR globally of approximately 24% from 2021 to 2026, according to IHS. Similar to turbochargers for gasoline and diesel engines, turbochargers for hybrid vehicles are an essential component of maximizing fuel efficiency and overall engine performance. Our products provide OEMs with solutions that further optimize engine performance and position us well to serve OEMs as they add more electrified vehicles into their fleets.
Commercial vehicles. Our Company traces its roots to the 1950s when we helped develop a turbocharged commercial vehicle for Caterpillar. We have maintained our strategic relationship with key commercial vehicle OEMs for over 60 years as well as industry-leading positions across both on- and off-highway use. Our products improve engine performance and lower emissions on trucks, buses, agriculture equipment, construction equipment and mining equipment with engine sizes ranging 1.8L to 105L.
High-growth regions. We have a strong track record serving global and emerging OEMs, including customers in China and India, with an in-market, for-market strategy and operate full R&D and three manufacturing facilities in the high-growth regions that serve light and commercial vehicle OEMs. Our local presence in high-growth regions has helped us win business with key international and domestic Chinese OEMs, and we grew significantly faster than the vehicle production in these regions between 2013 and 2021.
Strong and collaborative relationships with leading OEMs globally
We supply our products to more than 60 OEMs globally. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 58% of net sales and our largest customer represented approximately 13% of our net sales in 2021. With over 60 years in the turbocharger industry, we have developed strong capabilities working with all major OEMs. We consistently meet their stringent design, performance and quality standards while achieving capacity and delivery timelines that are critical for customer success. Our track record of successful collaborations, as demonstrated by our strong client base and our ability to successfully launch between 65 and 100 product applications annually, is well recognized. For example, we received a 2017 Automotive News PACE™ Innovation Partnership Award in supporting Volkswagen’s first launch of an industry-leading VNT turbocharged gasoline engine, which is just one example of our strong collaborative relationships with OEMs. Our regional research, development and manufacturing capabilities are a key advantage in helping us to supply OEMs as they expand geographically and shift towards standardized engines and vehicle platforms globally.
Global aftermarket platform
Our Garrett aftermarket brand has strong recognition across distributors and garages globally, and is known for boosting performance, quality and reliability. We operate through a distribution network of more than 250 distributors covering 165 countries. Our aftermarket business has historically provided a stable stream of revenue supported by our large installed base, currently estimated at over 120 million vehicles. As turbocharger penetration rates continue to increase, we expect that our installed base and aftermarket opportunity will grow.
Highly-engineered portfolio with continuous product innovation
We have led the revolution in turbocharging technology over the last 60 years and maintain a leading technology portfolio of approximately 1,600 patents and patents pending. We have a globally deployed team of more than 1,220 engineers across five R&D centers and 11 close-to-customer engineering centers. Our engineers have led the mainstream 
commercialization of several leading turbocharger innovations, including variable geometry turbines, dual-boost compressors, ball-bearing rotors, electrically actuated controls and air-bearing electric compressors for hydrogen fuel cells. We maintain a culture of continuous product innovation, introducing about ten new technologies per year and upgrading our existing key product lines approximately every 3 years. Outside of our turbocharger product lines, we apply this culture of continuous innovation to meet the needs of our customers in new areas, particularly in connected automotive technologies. We are developing solutions and increasing our R&D spend, focusing more than 40% of total R&D expenditure on new technologies like the Garrett E-Turbo that was recognized with the 2021 Automotive News PACE™ award for superior innovation, technological advancement and business performance among automotive suppliers. We are also continuing to develop MPC algorithms and cybersecurity software solutions that leverage our knowledge of vehicle powertrains and experience working closely with OEM manufacturers.
Global and low cost manufacturing footprint with operational excellence
Our geographic footprint locates R&D, engineering and manufacturing capabilities close to our customers, enabling us to tailor technologies and products for the specific vehicle types sold in each geographic industry. In all regions where we operate, we leverage low-cost sourcing through our robust supplier development program, which continually works to develop new suppliers that are able to meet our specific quality, productivity and cost requirements. We now source more than two-thirds of our materials from low-cost countries and believe our high-quality, low-cost supplier network to be a significant competitive advantage. We have invested heavily to bring differentiated local capabilities to our customers in high-growth regions, including China and India.
In 2021 we manufactured more than 87% of our products in low-cost countries, including seven manufacturing facilities in China, India, Mexico, Romania and Slovakia. We have a long-standing culture of lean manufacturing excellence and continuous productivity improvement. We believe global uniformity and operational excellence across facilities is a key competitive advantage in our industry given that OEM engine platforms are often designed centrally but manufactured locally, requiring suppliers to meet the exact same specifications across all locations.
Our Growth Strategies
Garrett invests in innovative technologies that address the needs of our customers in the ongoing auto industry transformation. This continued investment into differentiated technology, coupled with our relentless focus on deep customer relations and our global capabilities, allows us to drive the following business strategies:
Strengthen industry leadership across powertrain technologies
We are focused on strengthening our industry position in light vehicles:
•Gasoline turbochargers, which historically lagged adoption of diesel turbochargers, are expected to grow at an 7% annual CAGR from 2021 to 2026, according to IHS, exceeding the growth of diesel turbochargers. We expect to benefit from this higher growth given the gasoline platforms we have been awarded over the past several years. We have launched the first modern 1.5L VNT gasoline application with a major OEM and we expect to see increasing adoption of this technology in years to come. Key to our strategy for gasoline growth is our plan to leverage our technology strengths in high temperature materials and variable geometry technologies as well as our scale, global footprint and in-region capabilities to meet the volume demands of global OEMs.
•We believe growth in our share of the diesel turbochargers industry will be driven by new product introductions focused on emissions-enforcement technologies and supported by our favorable positioning with large vehicles and high-growth regions within this industry. The more stringent emissions standards require higher turbocharger technology content such as variable geometry, 2-stage systems, advanced bearings and materials which increase our content per vehicle. We expect to grow our commercial vehicle business through new product introductions and targeted platform wins with key on-highway customers and underserved OEMs.
Leverage our differentiated technology to solve key challenges in electrification
We stand to benefit from the increased adoption of hybrid-electric and fuel cell vehicles and the increased need for turbochargers associated with increased sales volumes for these engine types. IHS estimates that the global production of electrified vehicles (ranging from mild-hybrids to plugin-hybrids to battery and fuel cell electric vehicles) will increase from approximately 15 million vehicles in 2021 to approximately 51 million vehicles by 2026, representing an annualized growth rate of approximately 28%. OEMs will need to further improve engine performance for their increasingly hybrid electrified offerings, and our comprehensive portfolio of turbocharger and electric-boosting technologies are designed to 
help OEMs do so. We expect to continue to invest in product innovations and new technologies and believe that we are well positioned to continue to be a technology-leader in the propulsion of electrified vehicles. As we keep strengthening our electrical know-how, we believe our capabilities and technological expertise can be pivoted in the electrification arena for selected electric powertrain opportunities. With approximately 40% of our R&D investment in 2021 and a team of more than 300 specialized engineers, we keep strengthening our electrical know-how, and we believe our capabilities and technological expertise can be pivoted in the electrification arena for selected electric powertrain opportunities.
Increase industry position in high-growth regions
In 2021, after a steep drop in the first quarter due to strict lockdowns, vehicle production in China continued to experience further challenges through the third quarter from supply chain disruptions caused by shortage of semiconductor components whereas fourth quarter recovery partly compensated for the decline in the first three quarters, with a 4% full year growth, aligned to average growth in the other regions. IHS expects vehicle production in China to be stable next year. We plan to continue to strengthen our relationships with OEMs in high-growth, emerging regions by demonstrating our technology leadership through our local research, development and manufacturing capabilities. We expect our local footprint to continue to provide a strong competitive edge in high-growth regions due to our ability to work closely with OEMs throughout all stages of the product lifecycle including aftermarket support. For example, in China, our research center in Shanghai, our manufacturing facilities in Wuhan and Shanghai and our 1,042 employees support our differentiated end-to-end capabilities and we believe will continue to support key platform wins in the Chinese market. Our operations in China are expected to continue to benefit us as OEMs build global platforms in low cost regions. Our commitment to providing high-touch technology support to OEMs has allowed us to be recognized as a local player in other key high-growth regions, such as India.
Grow our aftermarket business
We have an opportunity to strengthen our global network of more than 250 distributors in 165 countries by deepening our channel penetration, leveraging our well-recognized Garrett brand, utilizing new online technologies for customer engagement and sales, and widening the product portfolio. Installer Connect, a global web-based platform providing self-service tools aimed at connecting garage technicians attracted 265 thousand visitors and more than 65 thousand garage technicians have registered on the platform to use Garrett self-learning and certification steps in 2021. Additionally, the Garrett Web Racing & Performance section of our website attracted more than one million visitors in 2021.
Drive continuous product innovation across connected vehicles, software and controls
We are actively investing in software and services that leverage our capabilities in powertrains, vehicle performance management, and electrical/mechanical design to capitalize on the growth relating to connected and electric vehicles. More than 85% of passenger vehicles sold in Europe and the United States and almost 50% of vehicles sold in China in 2021 were estimated to be connected in some way to the Internet according to Strategy &, a consultancy firm. According to the same report, that number is expected to reach 100% in Europe and the United States and >90% in China by 2025. Building on our software and connected vehicle capabilities, we have assembled a team of engineers, software and technical experts and have opened design centers in North America, India, China, Korea, Romania and Czech Republic. We continue to target key areas of the industry where we are best positioned to leverage our existing technology platforms and capabilities to serve our customers. We execute a portion of our connectivity investment in collaboration with OEMs and other Tier 1 suppliers and have multiple production programs with customers underway.
Research, Development and Intellectual Property
We maintain technical engineering centers in major automotive production regions of the world to develop and provide advanced products, process and manufacturing support to all of our manufacturing sites, and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design developments on a global basis. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,220 engineers. Our total R&D expenses were $136 million, $111 million and $129 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, the Company incurs engineering-related expenses which are also included in Cost of goods sold of $22 million, $13 million, and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. While it already represents approximately 40% of our R&D expenditures, we expect to further increase this percentage to support our new strategic growth opportunities in 2022, in particular in the domain of electrification of drivetrains and fuel cell technology.
We currently hold approximately 1,600 patents and patents pending. Our current patents are expected to expire between 2022 and 2041. While no individual patent or group of patents, taken alone, is considered material to our business, taken in the aggregate, these patents provide meaningful protection for our intellectual property.
Materials
The most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products are grey iron, aluminum, stainless steel and a nickel-, iron- and chromium-based alloy. As of December 31, 2021, we have not experienced any significant shortage of raw materials and normally we or our suppliers (on our behalf) do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules.
Customers
Our global customer base includes nine of the ten largest light vehicle OEMs and nine of the ten largest commercial vehicle engine makers.
Our ten largest applications in 2021 were with six different OEMs. OEM sales were approximately 87% of our 2021 revenues while our aftermarket and other products contributed 13%.
Our largest customer is Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (“BMW”). In 2021, 2020 and 2019, BMW accounted for 13%, 11%, and 7%, respectively, of our total sales. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, our sales to Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) were 10%, 10%, and 12%, respectively, of our total sales. 
Supply Relationships with Our Customers
We typically supply products to our OEM customers through “open” purchase orders, which are generally governed by terms and conditions negotiated with each OEM. Although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer, they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers are not required to purchase a minimum amount of product from us. These relationships typically extend over the life of the related engine platform. Prices are negotiated with respect to each business award, which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances, such as commodity or foreign exchange escalation/de-escalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us. The terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied. We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products.
Individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or non-performance and, in most cases, upon our insolvency and certain change of control events. In addition, many of our OEM customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs, which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program, and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program, which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts. We manufacture, and ship based on customer release schedules, normally provided on a weekly basis, which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or inventory levels throughout the supply chain.
Although customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of OEM production during such future periods, customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders. Firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials, sub-components and work-in-process inventory for OEM orders and from current on-hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders. The dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved.
Regulatory and Environmental Compliance
We are subject to the requirements of environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in each country in which we operate. These include, among other things, laws regulating air emissions, water discharge, hazardous materials and waste management. We have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally. Although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations, we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material.
Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances. At this time, we are involved in various stages of investigation and 
cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities. In addition, there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities.
As of December 31, 2021, the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was $18 million. We do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and we cannot determine either the timing or the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.
The Company previously had asbestos-related liability payments and accounts payable primarily reflecting the terms of the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement with Honeywell entered into on September 12, 2018, under which our wholly owned indirect subsidiary Garrett ASASCO Inc. was expected to make payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90% of Honeywell’s asbestos-related liability payments and accounts payable, primarily related to Honeywell’s former Bendix business in the United States, as well as certain environmental-related liability payments and accounts payable and non-United States asbestos-related liability payments and accounts payable, in each case related to legacy elements of the Bendix business, including the legal costs of defending and resolving such liabilities, less 90% of Honeywell’s net insurance receipts and, as may be applicable, certain other recoveries associated with such liabilities (the "Honeywell Indemnity Agreement"). The Plan as confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court includes a global settlement with Honeywell providing for, among other things, the full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of all liabilities under or related to the certain agreements with Honeywell, including under the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement.

Corporate Responsibility
WeCare4 Sustainability Approach
Garrett’s mission to enable cleaner, safer vehicles is at the heart of its contribution to society. We develop solutions for the auto industry's most pressing sustainability issues, from emissions reduction to vehicle cybersecurity. Our governance model demonstrate that the Senior Leadership and The Board of Directors are committed to promoting and developing corporate responsibility and sustainability, assessing and prioritizing topics that are material to the business and monitoring adherence to Company standards. These commitments are formalized in the charter of the Nominating & Governance Committee.
Garrett WeCare4 global sustainability approach is focused on the essential building blocks required to successfully achieve its mission: a culture of innovation and responsible operations. 
Culture of innovation: Investing on people both inside and outside the company.
•Developing Garrett’s people: We promote respect, diversity, and encourage everyone to fulfil their potential. We support our employees in their careers, offering a comprehensive training and development program, and leadership training for managers. Garrett global network of Diversity and Inclusion ("D&I")_champions drive an inclusive culture and develop awareness activities. In 2021, through the Garrett Together communications platform, the company continued to help employees globally to stay connected as work for many moved from office to home and to promote a positive mindset while navigating work and life through COVID-19. Garrett also re-focused part of its community outreach programs to provide help to the local populations where it was most urgently needed. In India, Garrett donated 5 live-saving adult ventilators to the Sassoon hospital in Pune for the intensive care unit beds. Following the floods in Maharashtra, state where the Garrett production site in Pune is located, the company organized the transportation and distribution of Hygiene kits provided to 874 families.
•Educating future innovators: Garrett sponsors internship, graduate program, and higher education institutes in several countries. The company is providing students with a tailor-made Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (“STEM”) program and holding regular open days for schoolchildren. In Romania, Garrett employees continued to focus their action in helping young people. A team of volunteers helped 70 students to find the right career path while another team joined the “Give a Byte of Help” cause and organized a donation of 90 fully equipped computers which benefited to over 1,000 children in institutions in disadvantaged areas of Romania. 
Responsible operations: Being responsible in what we do and in the way we behave as a company and as employees.
•Managing our environmental footprint: In addition to the considerable impact we have on reducing harmful emissions from vehicles, we are also committed to reducing our own impact on the environment. As a worldwide business, Garrett applies global standards to environmental impact as part of our lifecycle management, assessing end-to-end performance from design through to manufacturing and service support. All of our sites are certified ISO 14001. In 2021 Garrett improved its EcoVadis silver rating with a score of 63, putting the company in the top 5% in the industry and consolidated its Carbon Disclosure Project B rating.
•Behaving ethically: Garrett people share a responsibility to act ethically and with the highest professional standards at all times. We hold our suppliers to the same high standards and have a Regulatory Materials Compliance Process for Suppliers. We have clear policies for the responsible procurement of raw materials and Conflict Minerals. Our Supplier Code of Business Conduct outlines our requirements for suppliers to treat their employees with dignity and respect. 
Garrett articulates its commitments to social and environmental considerations in the communities in which it operates in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct, which can be found on our website at www.garrettmotion.com under "Corporate – Sustainability". The Company published its first sustainability report in 2021, the content of which is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.
Human Capital Disclosure
At Garrett, we place a high value on developing the right working environment and the right skillsets to advance our performance culture, support our growth strategy and ensure that the world at large can continue to benefit from breakthroughs in sustainable mobility. We invest in creating an inclusive, stimulating, and safe work environment where our employees can deliver their workplace best every day. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 6,500 permanent employees and 2,200 temporary and contract workers globally.
Diversity, equity and inclusion
Diversity and Inclusion is one of Garrett’s four fundamentals. As such, we strive to ensure that our employees are each involved, supported, respected and connected. Embracing diverse thoughts and ideas through inclusion leads to a competitive advantage in the market, increased innovation as we generate new and better ideas, and customer-centric decision making. We pride ourselves that Diversity is represented from the top of the organisation, for example 15 different 
nationalities are represented in our senior management team and they bring with them a wide variety of different backgrounds and experiences.
In 2021, the Company continued to strengthen and develop its approach to diversity, equity and inclusion. Actions during the year included:
•Regular reporting and review of existing diversity and inclusion metrics and initiatives
•Work by 14 Diversity and Inclusion Champions in key countries to develop local D&I initiatives suitable for the local context while aligning with the global strategy
•Holding Garrett’s annual Diversity and Inclusion Week during October based on the themes of 'Small Actions Make a Big Difference'.
During the year Garrett increased the percentage of female representation in the total workforce from 20.4% in 2020 to 21.8% in 2021. This continues the progress being made to achieve our ambition of reaching a representation percentage of 25% by 2025. In addition, the percentage of female representation in Senior Management roles increased from 19.5% in 2020 to 20.0% in 2021. This compares to our 2025 ambition, again at 25% 
The table below shows the evolution of our gender diversity representation over the last four years:

 | 2018 | | 2019 | | 2020 | 2021 | | 2025 Ambition
% Women in total workforce | 18.9 | % | | 19.7 | % | 20.4 | % | | 21.8 | % | 25.0 | %
% Women in Senior Management | 17.0 | % | | 16.7 | % | 19.5 | % | | 20.0 | % | 25.0 | %

As of December 31, 2021, Garrett’s Board of Directors had 33% female representation. 
Talent Management
At Garrett, we encourage our employees to develop their skills and capabilities through a comprehensive Performance and Talent Management system. From annual goal-setting and performance reviews to learning opportunities for employees and leaders, Garrett helps its people align their professional experience with the Company’s business objectives and encourages them to take ownership of their development and career paths.
Our learning environment offers employees access to more than 1,000 online trainings that address a wide range of functional competencies, technical skills, and human skills. Learning can be self-paced, while Garrett’s growing online peer-to-peer learning communities also allow employees to easily access courses specific to their function and to share materials and ideas on topics of interest. A variety of instructor led virtual programs were deployed during 2021 to support employees' development and a number of dedicated programs for emerging and experienced leaders were successfully held. Approximately 60,000 hours of online training was delivered during 2021.
Garrett uses regular talent reviews to strengthen the Company’s internal development processes and to calibrate assessment of individual performance. Twice per year we hold succession planning meetings up to and including the Executive Level during which the bench-strength of teams are scrutinized and development plans for their talent are reviewed. Ahead of both annual and mid-year performance reviews, leaders hold calibration meetings to ensure that assessment ratings are consistent and fair amongst peer groups.
Be well, work well
Health and Safety 
World-class health and safety considerations are integrated into Garrett’s procedures and processes. Our management systems apply global standards that have transitioned from Occupational Health & Safety Assessment Series ("OHSAS") 18001 to ISO 45001 and that provide protection of human health and safety during normal and emergency situations. Compliance with our standards and local regulatory requirements is monitored through a company-wide self-assessment process assured through annual audits. The timely development and implementation of process improvement and corrective action plans are closely monitored. 
From early 2020, Garrett’s global Health and Safety team worked tirelessly to deliver and implement best practice safety guidelines relating to COVID-19. A global safety campaign was rolled out alongside dedicated employee newsletters 
to support the entire workforce with rules on staying safe and healthy. The global safety campaign and newsletter remained in place throughout 2021.
The particular focus on the health of our employees to address the challenges posed by COVID-19 also provided a benefit in the focus on their safety in which we maintained good performance in our Total Case Incident Rate (“TCIR”). TCIR is measured as the number of recordable injuries and illnesses multiplied by 200,000 and then that number is divided by the total number of hours worked by employees, TCIR was maintained at 0.11 in 2021, which is consistent with the TCIR in the previous two years, even during a return to full production, and despite the additional challenges of protecting our teams from COVID-19 during the pandemic.
Compensation and benefits
Garrett’s Rewards programs are rooted in our “Be well, work well” principle, and aim to support employees in achieving the right work-life balance. We invest significant time and resources in establishing compensation programs that are both competitive and equitable. We constantly evaluate our positions for market competitiveness and adjust when necessary with the goal of ensuring the retention of top talent and continuation of equitable pay practices. 
As part of our commitment to the well-being of our employees, Garrett offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). It is an external counselling service designed to assist employees with personal, family, or workplace matters. This service is confidential and is also available to each employee’s dependents.
In late 2020, Garrett made a number of well-being resources available to all its connected employees, including useful tools and techniques for managing mental and physical health, in addition to dedicated online events. These remained in place throughout 2021.
Employee feedback, representation, and retention
Garrett’s Performance Management system aims to ensure that two-way dialogue is ongoing between employees and managers, punctuated by both an annual and a mid-year review, which provides employees the opportunity to express their opinions and ideas in terms of their development goals and career aspirations.
Garrett’s strategy is to build positive, direct, business-focused working relationships with all employees in order to drive business results. Garrett respects employees’ rights and their wish to be part of employee representative bodies including unions, work councils and employee forums. The Company understands the value of collective bargaining in its labour and employee relations strategy and the importance of trust in its working relationships. Approximately 40% of the Company’s permanent employees (including both full-time and part-time employees) are represented by unions and works councils under current collective bargaining agreements. 
Garrett closely monitors employee turnover to measure retention and define improvement actions as and where necessary. As of December 2021, the Company’s annual voluntary turnover for 2021 was 11.3%. which reflect the trends of the current global marketplace for talent. Garrett has developed a full set of actions to maximise retention that are carried out at both a global and local level, with line managers as well as functional leaders held accountable for their employee turnover performance. We intend to continue to work diligently on this area to mitigate against the challenges of a highly competitive global marketplace for talent.
Educating future innovators
Garrett places a high value on STEM research and learning opportunities that provide young people with the skills needed to develop the future of sustainable mobility. The Company sponsors higher education institutes in several countries to further critical research in technical areas and provide students with opportunities to study STEM programs.
Garrett’s Internship Programs enable students to connect theoretical knowledge with practical responsibilities in the spirit of ‘living laboratories’ during which they are encouraged to take ownership of business projects and define tactics to meet the project goals. Despite the challenging context of COVID-19, Garrett offered 124 internships (approximately 50% in Engineering, 19% in IT, 10% in Integrated Supply Chain and the remainder in Finance, HR, Marketing and Sales) in 11 countries during 2021.
Garrett runs a Graduate Program which in 2021 provided 11 graduates in 5 countries with a unique 3 to 2 year opportunity to gain experience and exposure to Garrett’s cutting-edge technologies while at the same time building their leadership skills in a fast-paced and professional work environment.
 The Company sponsors Formula SAE and Formula Student teams in several countries and in 2021 sponsored the European BEST Engineering Competition, the biggest international technical competition in Central Europe, where Garrett defined an assignment for 24 students around the concept of sustainable future mobility.
Prior to COVID-19, Garrett teams regularly held open days for school children in their host communities, with a specific focus on encouraging girls to take an interest in STEM. With many host communities forced into lockdown in 2021, Garrett instead supported local first responders in several countries with the donation of PPE, and provided food and sanitation products for 2,000 vulnerable families around Garrett’s sites in India.
Seasonality
Our business is typically moderately seasonal. Our primary North American customers historically reduce production during the month of July and halt operations for approximately one week in December; our European customers generally reduce production during the months of July and August and for one week in December; and our Chinese customers often reduce production during the period surrounding the Chinese New Year. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. In addition, automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of July, August and September due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models. Accordingly, our results reflect this seasonality. Our sales predictability in the short term might also be impacted by sudden changes in customer demand, driven by our OEM customers’ supply chain management.
We also typically experience seasonality in cash flow, as a relatively small portion of our full year cash flow is typically generated in the first quarter of the year and a relatively large portion in the last quarter. This seasonality in cash flow is mostly caused by timing of supplier payments for capital expenditures, changes in working capital balances related to the sales seasonality discussed above, and incentive payments.
These trends were less significant during 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we expect them to continue in the future once the pandemic is resolved.
