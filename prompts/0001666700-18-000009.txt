For additional information on the pro forma adjustments made, see Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
AGRICULTURE 
The Agriculture segment leverages the Company’s technology, customer relationships and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply and the global agriculture industry. Land available for worldwide agricultural production is increasingly limited so production growth will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity. The segment’s two global businesses, Seed and Crop Protection, deliver a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity, including well-established brands of seed products, crop chemicals, seed treatment, agronomy and digital services. Research and development ("R&D") focuses on leveraging germplasm and plant science technology to increase farmer productivity and to enhance the value of grains and oilseeds through improved seed traits, superior seed germplasm and effective use of crop protection solutions.

Seed
Seed is a global leader in developing and supplying advanced plant genetic products and technologies. The Seed business is a global leader in developing, producing and marketing hybrid corn seed and soybean seed varieties, primarily under the PIONEER® brand name, which improve the productivity and profitability of its customers. Additionally, the Seed business develops, produces and markets canola, cotton, sunflower, sorghum, wheat and rice seed, as well as silage inoculants. 
Crop Protection 
Crop Protection serves the global agriculture industry with crop protection products for field crops such as wheat, corn, soybean and rice, and specialty crops such as fruit, nut, vine and vegetables. Principle crop protection products are weed control, disease control and insect control offerings for foliar or soil application or as a seed treatment.
Merger Remedies - Dow and DuPont
As a condition of regulatory approval for the Merger, in addition to other requirements, Dow was required to divest a portion of Dow AgroSciences’ Brazil Corn Seed business and DuPont was required to divest certain assets related to its crop protection business and R&D organization, as discussed below.

Current and Future Investments
Dow announced a number of investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast to take advantage of increasing supplies of low-cost natural gas and NGLs derived from shale gas including: the restart of the St. Charles Operations ("SCO-2") ethylene production facility in December 2012; construction of a new on-purpose propylene production facility, which commenced operations in December 2015; an expansion in December 2016 of an ethylene production facility in Plaquemine, Louisiana, by up to 250 kilotonnes per annum ("KTA") and modifications to enable full ethane cracking flexibility; and, construction of a new world-scale ethylene production facility in Freeport, Texas, which commenced operations in the third quarter of 2017, and a capacity expansion project which will bring the facility's total ethylene capacity to 2,000 KTA. As a result of these investments, the Company’s exposure to purchased ethylene and propylene is expected to decline, offset by increased exposure to ethane- and propane-based feedstocks. The Company's global ethylene production capabilities are expected to increase by more than 25 percent relative to the 2012 baseline. 
In 2016, Dow completed an expansion of a gas-phase polyethylene production facility in Seadrift, Texas. Expansion projects are currently underway at Dow’s gas-phase polyethylene units in St. Charles, Louisiana, with expected start-up in mid-2018. In May 2017, Dow announced the construction of a world-scale 600 KTA polyethylene production facility in the U.S. Gulf Coast and a series of incremental debottleneck projects which will result in 350 KTA of additional polyethylene, the majority of which will be in the U.S. & Canada; and construction of a new world-scale 450 KTA polyolefins production facility in Europe. Dow is also building four new production facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast to leverage an advantaged feedstock position to support profitable growth of the Company’s high value performance plastics franchise, which include: an ELITE™ Polymer production facility, which commenced operations in 2017 in coordination with the new ethylene production facility; a Low Density Polyethylene ("LDPE") production facility and a NORDEL™ Metallocene EPDM production facility, which are expected to start-up in early 2018; and a High Melt Index ("HMI") specialty and conventional Polyolefin Elastomers production facility, which is expected to start-up in late 2018.
