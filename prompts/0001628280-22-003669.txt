Item 1.        Business (All amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)
General:
Balchem Corporation (“Balchem,” the “Company,” “we” or “us”), was incorporated in the State of Maryland in 1967. We develop, manufacture, distribute and market specialty performance ingredients and products for the nutritional, food, pharmaceutical, animal health, medical device sterilization, plant nutrition and industrial markets. Previously, our four reportable segments were: Human Nutrition and Health, Animal Nutrition and Health, Specialty Products, and Industrial Products. However, effective in the first quarter of 2020, in order to align with our strategic focus on health and nutrition, allocation of resources, and evaluation of operating performance, and given the 2019 reduction in portfolio scale of Industrial Products, we have revised our reporting segment structure to three reportable segments: Human Nutrition and Health, Animal Nutrition and Health, and Specialty Products. These reportable segments are strategic businesses that offer products and services to different markets. This realignment has been retrospectively applied. Sales and production of products outside of our reportable segments and other minor business activities are included in "Other and Unallocated" and applied retroactively to 2019. There was no change to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the change to the reportable segments. We expect that the new reportable segment structure will provide investors greater understanding of and alignment with our strategic focus. In order to ensure appropriate transparency and visibility into the financial performance of the Company, sufficient detail will continue to be provided relative to Other and Unallocated, including material contributions from oil and gas and other industrial market activities. 
We sell our products through our own sales force, independent distributors and sales agents. Financial information concerning our business, business segments and geographic information appears in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 below and in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
Human Nutrition & Health
The Human Nutrition & Health ("HNH") segment provides human grade choline nutrients and mineral amino acid chelated products through this segment for nutrition and health applications. Choline is recognized to play a key role in the development and structural integrity of brain cell membranes in infants, processing dietary fat, reproductive development and neural functions, such as memory and muscle function. The Company's mineral amino acid chelates, specialized mineral salts, and mineral complexes are used as raw materials for inclusion in premier human nutrition products. Proprietary technology has been combined to create an organic molecule in a form the body can readily assimilate. Sales growth for human nutrition applications is reliant on differentiation from lower-cost competitive products through scientific data, intellectual property and customers' appreciation of brand value. Consequently, the Company makes investments in such activities for long-term value differentiation. This segment also serves the food and beverage industry for beverage, bakery, dairy, confectionary, and savory manufacturers. The Company partners with its customers from ideation through commercialization to bring on-trend beverages, baked goods, confections, dairy and meat products to market. The Company has expertise in trends analysis and product development. When combined with its strong manufacturing capabilities in customized spray dried and emulsified powders, extrusion and agglomeration, blended lipid systems, liquid flavor delivery systems, juice and dairy bases, chocolate systems, as well as ice cream bases and variegates, the Company is a one-stop solutions provider for beverage and dairy product development needs. Additionally, this segment provides microencapsulation solutions to a variety of applications in food, pharmaceutical and nutritional ingredients to enhance performance of nutritional fortification, processing, mixing, and packaging applications and shelf-life. Major product applications are baked goods, refrigerated and frozen dough systems, processed meats, seasoning blends, confections, sports and protein bars, dietary plans, and nutritional supplements. The Company also creates cereal systems for ready-to-eat cereals, grain-based snacks, and cereal based ingredients.
Animal Nutrition & Health
The Company’s Animal Nutrition & Health ("ANH") segment provides nutritional products derived from its microencapsulation and chelation technologies in addition to basic choline chloride. For ruminant animals, the Company’s microencapsulated products boost health and milk production, delivering nutrient supplements that are biologically available, providing required nutritional levels. The Company’s proprietary chelation technology provides enhanced nutrient absorption for various species of production and companion animals and is marketed for use in animal feed throughout the world. ANH also manufactures and supplies choline chloride, an essential nutrient for monogastric animal health, predominantly to the poultry, pet and swine industries. Choline, which is manufactured and sold in both dry and aqueous forms, plays a vital role in the metabolism of fat. In poultry, choline deficiency can result in reduced growth rates and perosis in young birds, while in swine production choline is a necessary and required component of gestating and lactating sow diets for both liver health and prevention of leg deformity.
Sales of value-added encapsulated products are highly dependent on overall industry economics as well as the Company's ability to leverage the results of university and field research on the animal health and production benefits of our products. Management believes that success in the commodity-oriented basic choline chloride marketplace is highly dependent on the Company’s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent product quality and customer service. The Company continues to drive production efficiencies in order to maintain its competitive-cost position to effectively compete in a competitive global marketplace.
Specialty Products
Ethylene oxide, at the 100% level and blended with carbon dioxide, is sold as a sterilant gas, primarily for use in the health care industry. It is used to sterilize a wide range of medical devices because of its versatility and effectiveness in treating hard or soft surfaces, composites, metals, tubing and different types of plastics without negatively impacting the performance of the device being sterilized. The Company’s 100% ethylene oxide product and blends are distributed worldwide in specially designed, reusable and recyclable drum and cylinder packaging, to assure compliance with safety, quality and environmental standards as outlined by the applicable regulatory agencies in the countries our products are shipped to. The Company’s inventory of these specially built drums and cylinders, along with its five filling facilities, represents a significant capital investment. Contract sterilizers and medical device manufacturers are principal customers for this product. The Company also sells single use canisters with 100% ethylene oxide for use in sterilizing re-usable devices typically processed in autoclave units in hospitals. As a fumigant, ethylene oxide blends are highly effective in killing bacteria, fungi, and insects in spices and other seasoning materials.
The Company also distributes a number of other gases for various uses, most notably propylene oxide and ammonia. Propylene oxide is marketed and sold in the U.S. as a fumigant to aid in the control of insects and microbiological spoilage; and to reduce bacterial and mold contamination in certain shell and processed nut meats, processed spices, cacao beans, cocoa powder, raisins, figs and prunes. The Company distributes its propylene oxide product in the U.S. primarily in recyclable, single-walled, carbon steel cylinders according to standards outlined by the EPA and the DOT. Propylene oxide is also sold worldwide to customers in approved reusable and recyclable drum and cylinder packaging for various chemical synthesis applications, such as increasing paint durability and manufacturing specialty starches and textile coatings. Ammonia is used primarily as a refrigerant, and also for heat treatment of metals and various chemical synthesis applications, and is distributed in reusable and recyclable drum and cylinder drum and cylinder packaging approved for use in the countries these products are shipped to. The Company's inventory of cylinders for these products also represents a significant capital investment.
The Company’s micronutrient agricultural nutrition business sells chelated minerals primarily into high value crops. The Company has a unique and patented two-step approach to solving mineral deficiency in plants to optimize health, yield and shelf-life.  First, the Company determines optimal mineral balance for plant health. The Company then has a foliar applied Metalosate® product range, utilizing patented amino acid chelate technology. Its products quickly and efficiently deliver mineral nutrients. As a result, the farmer/grower gets healthier crops that are more resistant to disease and pests, larger yields and healthier food for the consumer with extended shelf life for produce being shipped long distances.
Acquisitions
On December 13, 2019, we completed an acquisition of Zumbro River Brand, Inc. ("Zumbro"), headquartered in Albert Lea, Minnesota. We made payments of $52,403 on the acquisition date, amounting to $47,058 to the former shareholders and $5,345 to Zumbro's lenders to pay Zumbro debt. Considering the cash acquired of $686, net payments made to the former shareholders equaled $46,372. In May 2020, we received an adjustment for working capital acquired of $561. The acquisition was primarily financed through the Company's Credit Agreement (Refer to Note 8, "Revolving Loan"). Zumbro specializes in developing, marketing, and manufacturing agglomerated and extruded products for the food and beverage industry and is a market leader in high protein and specialty extruded snacks, cereals, and crisps, marketed under the brands Z-Crisps®, Whey-Os™, Whey-Vs™, and Z-Texx Complete™. Zumbro is integrated within Balchem's HNH Segment.
On May 27, 2019, we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common shares of Chemogas Holding NV, a privately held specialty gases company headquartered in Grimbergen, Belgium ("Chemogas"). We made payments of approximately €99,503 (translated to $111,324) on the acquisition date, amounting to approximately €88,579 (translated to $99,102) to the former shareholders and approximately €10,924 (translated to $12,222) to Chemogas' lender to pay off all Chemogas bank debt. Considering the cash acquired of €3,943 (translated to $4,412), net payments made to the former shareholders were €84,636 (translated to $94,690). The acquisition was primarily financed through our Credit Agreement (Refer to Note 8, "Revolving Loan"). Chemogas, through its subsidiary companies, has been a leader in the packaging and distribution of a wide variety of specialty gases, most notably ethylene oxide, primarily in the European and Asian markets, for medical device sterilization. Through its operational and logistical excellence, Chemogas supports its customers' needs across more than 70 countries. With the acquisition, we significantly expand our geographic presence in the packaged ethylene oxide market, enabling us to offer 
worldwide service and support to its medical device sterilization customers within the Specialty Products segment. The Chemogas sites in Europe and Asia, along with Balchem's sites in the United States form a global network of facilities.
Raw Materials
The raw materials utilized by us in the manufacture of our products are sourced from suppliers both domestically and internationally. Such raw materials include materials derived from petrochemicals, minerals, metals, agricultural commodities and other readily available commodities and are subject to price fluctuations due to market conditions. In 2021, we experienced some difficulties in procuring certain materials due to the challenging macroeconomic environment with global supply chain disruptions because of COVID-19 pandemic. However, we were able to secure most materials from our suppliers and will continue to ensure a sustainable supply chain to support our growing business operations. 
Intellectual Property
We currently hold 109 patents in the United States and overseas and use certain trade-names and trademarks. We also use know-how, trade secrets, formulae, and manufacturing techniques that assist in maintaining competitive positions of certain of our products. Formulae and know-how are of particular importance in the manufacture of a number of our proprietary products. We believe that certain of our patents, in the aggregate, are advantageous to our business. However, it is believed that no single patent or related group of patents is currently so material to us that the expiration or termination of any single patent or group of patents would materially affect our business. Our U.S. patents expire between 2022 and 2036. We believe that our sales and competitive position are dependent primarily upon the quality of our products, technical sales efforts and market conditions, rather than on patent protection.
Seasonality
While in general, the businesses of our segments are not seasonal to any material extent, the plant nutrition business within Specialty Products is a seasonal business with the vast majority of sales occurring in the first half of the year, based on the planting season in the northern hemisphere.
Backlog
At December 31, 2021, we had a total backlog of $65,661 (comprised of $45,393 for the HNH segment; $14,483 for the ANH segment; $4,935 for the Specialty Products segment, and $850 for other), as compared to a total backlog of $64,811 at December 31, 2020 (comprised of $52,293 for the HNH segment; $8,620 for the ANH segment; $3,557 for the Specialty Products segment and $341 for other). It has generally been our policy and practice to maintain an inventory of finished products and/or component materials for our segments to enable us to ship products within two months after receipt of a product order. This has been more difficult in 2021 given the macroeconomic and supply chain challenges we have been experiencing, but all orders in the current backlog are expected to be filled in the 2022 fiscal year.
Competition
Our competitors include many large and small companies, some of which have greater financial, research and development, production and other resources than us. Competition in the supplement, food and beverage markets we serve are based primarily on product performance, customer support, quality, service and price. The development of new and improved products is important to our success. This competitive environment requires substantial investments in product and manufacturing process research and development. In addition, the winning and retention of customer acceptance of our food and nutrition products involve substantial expenditures for application testing, either internally or at customer/prospect sites, and sales efforts. Our competition in this market includes a variety of ingredient and nutritional supplement companies many of which are privately-held. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the size of all of our segment competitors or where we rank in comparison to such privately-held competitors.
Competition in the animal feed and industrial markets we serve are based primarily on product performance, customer support, quality, service and price. The markets for our products are subject to competitive risks because these markets are highly price competitive. Our competition in this market includes a variety of animal nutrition and health ingredient companies, along with certain industrial companies, many of which are privately-held. Therefore, we are unable to assess the size of all of our competitors or where we rank in comparison to such privately-held competitors.
In the Specialty Products segment, we face competition from alternative sterilizing technologies and products for our performance gases business. Competition in this marketplace is based primarily on service, reliability, quality, and price. Our competition in this market varies globally, many of which are regional privately-held companies. In our plant nutrition business, competition is 
based primarily on product performance, customer support, quality, and price. The development of new and improved products is also important to our ability to compete. Our competition in this market is primarily regional privately-held companies. 
Research & Development
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred research and development expenses of approximately $13,524, $10,332, and $11,377, respectively, on Company-sponsored research and development for new products, improvements to existing products, and manufacturing processes. We have historically funded our research and development programs with funds available from current operations with the intent of recovering those costs from profits derived from future sales of products resulting from, or enhanced by, the research and development effort.
We prioritize our product development activities in an effort to allocate resources to those product candidates that, we believe, have the greatest commercial potential. Factors we consider in determining the products to pursue include projected markets and needs, status of our proprietary rights, technical feasibility, expected and known product attributes, and estimated costs to bring the product to market.
Capital Projects
We continue to invest in projects across all production facilities and capital expenditures were approximately $36,142, $32,080, and $25,790 for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021, we invested $20,544 on projects expected to provide favorable returns on investment, including expanded capacity in key product lines in the HNH segment. In addition, we invested $3,138 for environmental, health, safety, and security upgrades to our facilities, $2,330 in automation projects that improved quality and efficiency of our operations, and $2,222 in research and development projects. In 2020, we invested $16,856 on projects expected to provide favorable returns on investment, including expanded capacity in key product lines in the HNH segment. In addition, we invested $3,297 for environmental, health, safety, and security upgrades to our facilities as well as $3,252 in automation projects that improved safety and quality of our operations. In 2019, we invested $6,437 to expand capacity in key product lines in the HNH segment and to invest in several other large projects including a new quality and research and development lab. In addition, we invested $3,739 for environmental, health, safety, and security upgrades to our facilities. Capital expenditures are projected to range from $30,000 to $40,000 for 2022, including our continued efforts to invest in energy and water saving projects, while exploring additional renewable energy opportunities in support of the company's sustainability efforts. 
Environmental / Regulatory Matters
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), a health and safety statute, requires that certain products within our Specialty Products segment must be registered with the EPA because they are considered pesticides. In order to obtain a registration, an applicant typically must demonstrate, through extensive test data, that its product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment. We hold EPA registrations permitting us to sell ethylene oxide as a medical device sterilant and spice fumigant, and propylene oxide as a fumigant of nuts and spices.
In April 2008, the EPA issued a RED (“Reregistration Eligibility Decision”) for ethylene oxide which permitted the continued use of ethylene oxide “to sterilize medical or laboratory equipment, pharmaceuticals, and aseptic packaging, or to reduce microbial load on musical instruments, cosmetics, whole and ground spices and other seasoning materials and artifacts, archival material or library objects”. In 2013, the EPA has initiated a new registration review of ethylene oxide, in line with and part of the registration review scheduled for a large number of other pesticides. When the Final Work Plan was issued in March 2014, the EPA anticipated that this registration review process would take approximately seven years. In December 2016, the EPA issued its Integrated Risk Information System (“IRIS”) assessment of ethylene oxide (the "IRIS Assessment"), another aspect of EPA’s safety review of ethylene oxide. In November 2020, the EPA issued a Draft Human Health Risk Assessment for Ethylene Oxide (Draft HHRA). In this Draft HHRA, the EPA presented multiple perspectives on risk extrapolation, including the IRIS Assessment. While acknowledging the necessity of maintaining the critical uses of ethylene oxide, based on the range of unit risk provided in this qualitative assessment, the EPA has stated that there should be further mitigation measures implemented which will likely require some label changes. Several mitigation measures are under consideration and the EPA anticipates issuance of a Proposed Interim Decision (PID) in 2022. We believe that EPA intends to reregister ethylene oxide for the uses stated above with the mitigation measures potentially impacting certain users, including Balchem and its customers. The product, when used as a sterilant for certain medical devices, has no known equally effective substitute. In October 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in a public statement said, "Although medical devices can be sterilized by several methods, ethylene oxide is the most common method of sterilization of medical devices in the U.S. and is a well-established and scientifically-proven method of preventing harmful microorganisms from reproducing and causing infections." Management believes the lack of availability of this product could not be easily tolerated by various medical device manufacturers or the health care industry due to the resultant infection potential.
Similarly, the EPA issued a RED for propylene oxide in August 2006. At that time, the EPA “determined that products containing the active ingredient PPO [propylene oxide] are eligible for reregistration provided that…risk mitigation measures…are adopted.” Our product label was amended as required to reflect these mitigation measures and also to show that propylene oxide has been reclassified as a restricted use pesticide. In 2013, the EPA initiated a new registration review of propylene oxide, in line with and part of the registration review scheduled for a large number of other pesticides. A Final Work Plan was issued in March 2014, and EPA anticipated that this review process would take approximately seven years. In October 2020, the EPA issued both the Proposed Interim Registration Review Decision (PID) and Draft Risk Assessment (DRA) for Propylene Oxide (PPO). In July 2021, the EPA issued the Interim Registration Review Decision. Based on these documents, the use of propylene oxide to treat nuts and spices will continue to be permitted with minimal changes to the current approved level. We expect to submit those changes and the EPA to review and approve them, in the coming months.
Our facility in Verona, Missouri, while held by a prior owner, was designated by the EPA as a Superfund site and placed on the National Priorities List in 1983, because of dioxin contamination on portions of the site. Remediation was conducted by the prior owner under the oversight of the EPA and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (“MDNR”). While we must maintain the integrity of the capped areas in the remediation areas on the site, the prior owner is responsible for completion of any further Superfund remedy. We are indemnified by the sellers under our May 2001 asset purchase agreement covering our acquisition of the Verona, Missouri facility for potential liabilities associated with the Superfund site and one of the sellers, in turn, has the benefit of certain contractual indemnification by the prior owner that executed the above-described Superfund remedy. In September 2020, BCP Ingredients, Inc. (“BCP”), the Company subsidiary that operates the site received a General Notice Letter from the EPA regarding BCP’s potential liability for contamination at the site and, in February 2022, received a Special Notice Letter from EPA for the performance of a focused remedial investigation/feasibility study at the site with regard to the presence of certain contaminants, including 1,4 dioxane,. We have engaged experts to study site conditions and hydrogeology in connection with preparing our response to the notices.
In connection with normal operations at our plant facilities, we are required to maintain environmental and other permits, including those relating to the ethylene oxide operations.
We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with federal, state, local and international provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Such compliance includes the maintenance of required permits under air pollution regulations and compliance with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The cost of such compliance has not had a material effect upon the results of our operations or our financial condition. 
We produce products which are required to be manufactured in conformity with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations as interpreted and enforced by the FDA, through third party contract arrangement. Modifications, enhancements or changes in contracted manufacturing facilities or procedures relating to our pharmaceutical products are, in many circumstances, subject to FDA approval, which may be subject to a lengthy application process or which we may be unable to obtain. Any contracted manufacturing facilities that manufacture our pharmaceutical products are periodically subject to inspection by the FDA and other governmental agencies, and operations at these facilities could be interrupted or halted if the results of these inspections are unsatisfactory.
Human Capital
Our employees are our most valued asset and fundamental to our success. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,317 full-time employees worldwide, with approximately 17% covered by collective bargaining agreements. Although we are facing challenging labor markets, we believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced personnel in a competitive environment and that our human capital resources are adequate to perform all business functions. In addition, we continue to enhance technology in order to optimize productivity and performance. 
Health and Safety
Protecting the workplace environment and the health and safety of our employees, contractors, visitors, and neighbors is our top priority. Our recordable injury rate, which was defined by recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked, was 0.99 in 2021. We continually upgrade our facilities to reduce risks and establish procedures with appropriate personnel protection for the safety of our employees. Our safety program is structured around five pillars: process safety, personal safety, industrial hygiene, transportation safety and environmental safety, and focuses on driving higher ownership and engagement from employees and contractors. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we effectively deployed our Crisis Management Plan and activated our Crisis Management Team (CMT), to manage the day-to-day activities and make timely decisions related to the safety of our employees, 
customers, and the communities in which we operate. We implemented significant changes which comply with government orders and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. These changes include instituting travel restrictions, a mandatory work from home policy for all of our office employees, and additional safety measures for all of our manufacturing and research and development employees.
Diversity and Inclusion 
We recognize that our best performance is achieved when our teams are diverse, and accordingly, diversity and inclusion are important elements of Balchem's Human Resources strategy. We strive to promote inclusion through the implementation of inclusive leadership training across the Company and are committed to increasing representation of minorities throughout the organization. In 2021, our total workforce consisted of 76% male and 24% female among all employees and 50% male and 50% female when excluding supply chain and operations functions. With the support of our Board of Directors, we continue to explore additional diversity and inclusion initiatives. 
Training and Well-Being Programs
We strive to develop employee skills and knowledge, which includes training for job-specific technical knowledge, regulatory requirements, and company policies, through our internal learning and development platform. The topics of trainings include the Company's Code of Conduct, anti-harassment and discrimination, foreign corrupt practices, antitrust, cyber security, and various other compliance subjects. Our sponsored employee Continuing Learning program offers a broad base of assistance for employees, including learning and development courses. We also deployed unconscious bias and inclusive leadership training to our management team. Employees have access to healthy lifestyle discounts through our Wellness Center, as well as debt, legal, and financial counseling. Leadership programs, peak performance training and multiple online services and courses enable our employees to choose their own learning paths and work towards achieving their goals for education, finances, and overall well-being. 
Performance Review, Compensation and Benefits
Our annual performance review process is an important, objective-based dialogue to foster continuous growth and development by providing an opportunity to establish goals and deliver feedback relative to each employee's performance. Balchem's annual review process is closely aligned with a formal succession planning and talent review process designed to identify and develop the next generation of leaders. 
We are dedicated to providing full-time employees with a competitive compensation package that includes medical, dental, vision, and prescription benefits in addition to a 401(k) matching program. Balchem also provides financial support for health and wellness programs such as online financial wellness content, sponsored weight loss programs and subsidized gym memberships. We also provide generous time off and leave benefits, which are important to help ensure employees can enjoy a healthy balance between work and family time. 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our turnover rate was 13% for salaried employees with an average length of service of over 10 years. We are continuing to improve employee retention with effective employment engagement efforts, a productive performance review process, and competitive compensation.
