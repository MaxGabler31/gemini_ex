Company History
 
Premier Products Group, Inc. formally known as Valley High Mining Company (“we,” “us,”, “our,” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Utah on November 14, 1979, under the name Valley High Oil, Gas & Minerals, Inc. (“Valley High Oil”), for the purpose of engaging in the energy, mining and natural resources business. In order to raise the money necessary to acquire, explore and develop oil and gas properties and other natural resource-related ventures or projects, we undertook an offering of our common stock pursuant to the Regulation A exemption from registration afforded under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, wherein we offered and sold a total of 25 million common shares at a price of two cents ($0.02) per share and received gross proceeds of $500,000 from over 1,000 subscribers. These funds were utilized in our attempt to acquire and explore for oil and gas, uranium, coal, geothermal, and other mineral (metallic and nonmetallic) properties.

During the Company’s history, we have engaged in various efforts to increase and maintain shareholder value. The company entered in various equity and debt financing to raise the money necessary to operate and partake in business development. These funds were utilized in our attempt to acquire, explore, and to support the company’s ability to make and execute appropriate corporation actions.
 
In February 2016, the Company changed its domicile from the state of Nevada to the State of Wyoming as filed in our Form 8-K on March 1, 2016.
 
On Apr 26, 2016, Valley High Mining Company submitted an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation changing the company name from Valley High Mining Company (VHMC) to Premier Product Group, Inc. (PMPG) to the State of Wyoming. The New Changes were approved, stamped and filed on June 1, 2016.
 
As of the date of this filing, the Company is under a Letter of Intent with Satic Incorporated (“SATIC”), with the intent of SATIC becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Premier Products Group, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company agrees to issue to the SATIC shareholders, ratably apportioned based on their ownership in SATIC, Series S Preferred Stock of the Company, which shall be convertible into common shares of the Company so that the converted shares shall equal 65% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares, calculated on a fully diluted basis. This transaction is still pending and subject to certain conditions and deliverables, which each party may or may not be able to meet at this time.
 
Prior to this transaction and during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the company entered in a Letter of Intent (LOI) with conditions to merger with Gear Sports Nutrition, Inc. (“GEAR”) During the due diligence period, the Company changed its name to Premier Products Group, Inc. in anticipated closing of the merger. However, due to specific deliverables not achieved as outlined in the LOI by GEAR, the agreement was cancelled in August 2016
 
Between 1980 and 1985, we spent nearly all of our capital on several natural resource and mining ventures. In 1985, we effectuated a 10:1 reverse split. By 1986, after engaging in several unsuccessful ventures, we exhausted our capital reserves. From April 1989 through 2003, we were dormant, doing only those actions necessary to allow the Company to remain as an active entity. In April 2004, pursuant to the affirmative vote of our shareholders we reincorporated into the State of Nevada by merging with a wholly owned Nevada subsidiary company under the name Valley High Mining Company (the “Merger”). Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, for every 35 shares of Valley High Oil, a shareholder was entitled to receive one (1) share of Valley High Mining Company a Nevada corporation, the surviving entity in the Merger.
 
On April 19, 2004, the day that the Merger was effective, we entered into a mining lease agreement with North Beck Joint Venture, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (” North Beck”), an entity owned and controlled by our then principal shareholder and officer/director. The terms of the lease consideration were based upon prior lease agreements that North Beck Joint Venture had entered into with other mining companies in the past. As a result, we acquired control of over 470 acres of patented precious metals mining claims located adjacent to, and just west of, the town of Eureka in Juab County, Utah, in the so-called “Tintic Mining District” (the “North Beck Claims”). The Tintic Mining District of Juab County, Utah, is located approximately 100 miles south of Salt Lake City. The North Beck Claims have an extensive history and contain several mines, mining shafts or "prospecting pits," two of which are over 1,000 feet deep. This project also proved to be unsuccessful. As a result, in February 2010, control of our Company changed again, with the business objective to seek a suitable acquisition candidate through acquisition, merger, reverse merger or other suitable business combination method. We disposed of the North Beck Claims in connection with the change in control.
 
Until September 2012, our then management continued to seek a suitable acquisition candidate, without success. On September 8, 2012, we executed a Joint Venture Agreement (the “Joint Venture”) with Corizona Mining Partners LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company (“Corizona”). Prior, on July 20, 2012, the Company and Corizona formed a limited liability company, Minera Carabamba S.A. pursuant to the laws of Peru. The Joint Venture acquired a 50% leasehold interest in a property of approximately 966 hectares, located in La Libertad, Peru, in order to conduct gold mining operations on the property under the project name of Machacala. On March 1, 2013, the Company advised Corizona that we were no longer interested in continuing with our role in the Joint Venture due to the inability to gain access to the property.  
 
Also during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, we reviewed a second possible venture with Corizona.  They introduced us to a second property located in Peru and on October 5, 2012, we executed a letter of intent (“LOI”) to develop this project, which consisted of a 50% aggregate interest.  The LOI provided for us to initially own 80% of the venture, with Corizona owning the remaining 20%.  We agreed to pay the costs of developing the project, which was estimated to be approximately $500,000, subject to our due diligence.  We performed our due diligence on this project and discovered that it was not in production, despite representations to the contrary.  We also could not reach an agreement with Corizona on a budget for this project.  As a result, we elected to terminate this venture.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we also formed a wholly owned subsidiary, VH Energy, Inc., a Texas corporation, which was formed with the intention of engaging in the oil and gas industry.  We initially engaged in a venture which involved the brokerage of diesel fuel, which failed to close.  We have commenced legal action against various parties involved in this transaction, however the matter is closed. See “Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings,” below.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company began to identify new underserved and emerging industries to move into and discovered an increasing demand for fresher locally grown organic foods. The demand for organic food rose 11% between 2011 and 2012, reaching $28 billion and the market is now predicted to grow at a 14% annual rate for the next four years. As a result, the Company attempted to transition into the organic foods market and on December 4, 2014, the Company completed the purchase of a fully contained grow environment, or grow pod, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Bill of Sale. The grow pod was a template for many to be built and deployed into culture centers (between 20 and 40 pods). The grow pods were steel shipping containers converted to be self-contained, insulated, solarized, bug free, pesticide free, heated, cooled, LED lighted hydroponic growing facilities that can be managed from a computer or phone.. The Company has tried unsuccessfully throughout fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 to adequately capitalize its transition to the organic food market, and thus looked for new emerging markets.

Government Regulations
 
Domestic mineral exploration operations are subject to extensive federal regulation and, with respect to federal leases, to interruption or termination by governmental authorities on account of environmental and other considerations. The trend towards stricter standards in environmental legislation and regulation could increase our costs and others in the industry. Mineral lessees are subject to liability for the costs of clean-up of pollution resulting from a lessee’s operations, and may also be subject to liability for pollution damages. We do not intend to obtain insurance against costs of clean-up operations as we do not intend to continue in the mining industry, rather, we are transitioning to organic food and nutraceutical.
