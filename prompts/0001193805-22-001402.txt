The products measure the fill levels of tanks holding propane, diesel and other tank-based liquids and the related monitoring services includes transmission of fill data from the tanks via satellite to a secure website for display. 
Products and Services 
 
Xact Satellite Remote Tank Monitors include both ultrasonic and gauge reader sensors that provide remote fill level monitoring of propane, diesel and other tank-based liquids for tanks anywhere in the world. The Xact Tank Monitoring Systems are highly dependable, providing the ability to operate in a wide range of environments with temperatures ranging from -40ºC to 60ºC. The Xact systems can be used to monitor tanks as small as 125 gallons (473 liters) and as large as 90,000 gallons (340,686 liters). With Xact, users access timely and accurate remote tank-based data on a consistent schedule or by customized critical fill alarms to optimize inventory management processes.
 
The three main components to the Xact Tank Monitoring System are as follows: 
 
Tank Sensors - Xact offers two sensors, the Xact Ultrasonic sensor and the Xact Gauge Reader. 
 
The Xact Ultrasonic sensor incorporates patented technology and is externally mounted to the bottom of the tank with no reliance on existing mechanical gauges. The system employs a small electrical pulse, which is able to calculate the precise fill level inside using patented sonar technology (measurement accuracy to within ±2% for large tanks and ±1% for small tanks). Ultrasonic sensors work with any tank-based liquids including propane, diesel and natural gas. 
 
The Xact gauge reader connects to the face of a float gauge and detects the fill level that is reported by the gauge. The system then transmits that data by satellite in the same manner as the ultrasonic sensor. Float gauges have a typical accuracy range of ±4% to ±8%. Gauge readers are primarily used in the propane industry to monitor propane tanks and support refill optimization for distributors and customers. 
 
Satellite Radio Transmitter - The Xact radio transmitter is placed on the top of the tank and is connected by cable to the tank sensor or gauge reader. The transmitter transmits the tank data using the GlobalStar ® satellite network to the secure Xact website. Xact satellite telemetry provides global coverage with no dependence on land lines, cellular networks or Wi-Fi signals, making it a reliable monitoring solution for tanks located anywhere in the world.
