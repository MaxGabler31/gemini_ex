Overview
Limelight operates a private, globally distributed, high-performance network and provides a suite of integrated services marketed as the Limelight Orchestrate Platform. These services include content delivery, video content management, website and web application acceleration, website and content security, and cloud storage services. 
The services we provide help our customers optimize and deliver digital content to a wide variety of digital devices. These services provide advanced features to enable digital workflows for video publishing, content distribution for any device, and website and web application acceleration. Limelight services incorporate content and application security, file management, video transformation, distributed storage functionality, and the analytics and reporting associated with them. These services leverage our global network, which provides highly available, highly redundant storage, bandwidth, and computing resources, as well as connectivity to last-mile broadband network providers. Limelight’s high capacity, high speed private global network and distributed storage and compute capabilities are also well suited to the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) and edge compute workloads where rapid response times are needed.
We derive revenue primarily from the sale of components of the Limelight Orchestrate Platform. We also generate revenue through the sale of professional services and other infrastructure services, such as transit and rack space services. In addition, we also maintain relationships with resellers that purchase our services for resale to their end customers. 
We provide our services to customers that we believe view Internet, mobile, social, and other digital initiatives as critical to their success, including traditional and emerging media companies operating in the television, music, radio, newspaper, magazine, movie, game, software, and social media industries, as well as to enterprises, technology companies, and government entities conducting business online. Our offerings enable our customers to deliver a high quality online experience and thereby improve brand perception, drive revenue, and enhance customer relationships. 
We are a Delaware corporation formed in 2001. Our principal executive offices are located at 222 South Mill Avenue, 8th Floor, Tempe, Arizona 85281, and our main telephone number is (602) 850-5000. We began development of our infrastructure in 2001 and began generating meaningful revenue in 2002. We began international operations in 2004. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 717 active customers and had a presence in approximately 50 countries throughout the world.

Five Trends Driving Internet Congestion
We have identified five trends that point to an Internet of the future in which congestion may cause outages and prevent organizations from delivering the highest quality digital experiences. In this situation, the need and demand for private, global networks to deliver digital content become important. These trends are:

• | Shift to over the top (OTT) consumption for online video. Online video viewership continues to grow as does the number of connected devices for consuming content. In our September 2017 State of Online Video consumer report, we found that consumers watch approximately 5 hours and 45 minutes of online video per week on average, with Millennials far exceeding 7 hours. Viewing habits are shifting as well. There’s an increasing use of a multitude of devices to watch online video both inside and outside the home, ranging from computers and tablets to smart

2

phones and streaming devices. This trend reflects that many top-tier content owners have either already launched their content direct-to-consumer (e.g., HBO, CBS, Showtime) or have announced plans to do so. In addition, content owners continue to join forces with media companies (e.g., Sony, Hulu, Dish Networks) to launch OTT subscription services enabling consumers to bundle together channels for a fraction of the cost of a cable subscription. As day-to-day consumption of video content shifts to Internet-based delivery, we believe this will put an increasing strain on the Internet placing additional pressure on organizations and service providers to take steps to protect the quality of the end-user experience as this increasing segment of traffic competes with other Internet activities, such as browsing websites and downloading digital content.

• | Broadcast Quality Online Video. Consumers are continuing to consume online streaming video in record numbers. Online video is rapidly growing towards becoming a primary method by which users consume video content, whether it’s via their personal computers, smartphones, tablets, smart televisions, or other connected devices. Yet, consumers continue to expect the same quality experience online as they would have in viewing broadcast television. This will put a significant burden on publishers to produce not just compelling content, but also to deliver it in a way that meets changing consumer expectations. To keep up, organizations have been forced to increase quality to provide a “broadcast-like” experience. For example, with the recent advent of 4K resolution devices, several large-scale online video providers are already streaming in this new format that requires, in most cases, four times the bandwidth of a traditional high definition stream. We believe that as more content is made available in 4K resolution (coupled with increasing sales of 4K-ready devices like televisions and computer monitors), more consumers will want to consume the higher-quality content, resulting in increased strain on Internet architecture and infrastructure. 


• | Growth of digital downloads. Consumers are becoming more accustomed to making purchases of movies, music, games, and applications digitally from a variety of retailers with the growing availability of higher bandwidth connections to connected devices. As a result, consumers accept larger download sizes. For example, releases of popular games have topped 50 gigabytes (GBs) in size. As digital purchases of massive files increase, we believe that this will cause more strain on the Internet’s infrastructure. We believe that this will result in additional pressure on organizations and service providers to take steps to avoid congestion, latency, lengthening download times, and increasingly interrupted downloads, all of which we believe would undermine an organization’s ability to deliver the best possible digital experience.


• | Webpage size. Organizations are building more complex, interactive, and engaging digital experiences that rely heavily on imagery and multimedia content. This trend is reflected in the growing size of webpages. For example, today's average webpage requires users to download 2.5 MB worth of data, according to the HTTP-Archive, a site that tracks website performance and the technologies they use. We believe, through a highly congested Internet, these websites will become increasingly harder to deliver at the level of performance that users expect.


• | The Internet of Things (IoT). Connected devices communicate with each other and with server-based resources via the Internet. Although it is unclear as to how much bandwidth this “background communication” will consume, as more devices become connected and begin communicating with each other and other resources, this traffic will compete with other Internet traffic such as streaming video and digital downloads. We believe IoT may complicate an organization’s ability to utilize the Internet to deliver high quality digital experiences.

Seven Trends Illustrating Consumer Demand for Digital Content
The Internet is key for today’s digital business. Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and other Internet protocols are critical to enabling organizations to digitize business processes and operations as well as provide the kinds of experiences that consumers worldwide have come to expect across a variety of devices. We believe there are seven trends that illustrate a demand for digital content, contribute to the overall usage of the Internet, increase potential congestion, and punctuate the need for a private, global network to meet the level of performance that users expect. We believe these trends are:

• | The continued growth of online video. Consumers are demanding and consuming video, music, and other forms of rich media over the Internet. According to Cisco's Visual Networking Index annual report, IP video will account for 82% of all consumer Internet traffic by 2021. Based on this trend, we expect that businesses will continue to incorporate video into their digital marketing efforts as a way to further differentiate their message from competitors and generate new opportunities for engagement.


• | Mobile First. We believe that mobile will continue to be increasingly important as a primary method users employ to interact with online content, a position supported by our November 2017 State of The User Experience consumer research which indicated that smartphones are the most popular device for accessing online content. Mobile devices enable consumers to remain connected and engaged with an organization’s content when they are away from their

3

primary computers or TVs and it’s clear that consumers are employing these devices more often to do so. However, in order for those consumers to remain engaged, the experience must be optimized across devices. An organization’s dynamic content and video has to be accessible regardless of device and provide the same engagement and interaction with those users. 

• | The continued migration of information technology (IT) services into the cloud. Enterprises may seek to decrease infrastructure expenditures by moving to a “cloud-based” model in which application delivery and storage are available on-demand and paid for on an as-needed basis. We anticipate that the core cloud computing market will continue to grow at a rapid pace as the cloud increasingly becomes a mainstream IT strategy embraced by corporate enterprises and government agencies. According to Gartner, by 2020 the shift to cloud will affect more than $1 trillion in IT spending. The core cloud market includes platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings such as content delivery networks (CDN), as well as the cloud-delivered software used to build and manage a cloud environment. 


• | Increasing user expectations for digital experience performance. Websites are becoming increasingly complex and large, while user expectations for website performance are becoming more demanding. We anticipate that these demanding consumer expectations will drive a continued need for website and web application acceleration services. The combination of performance expectation coupled with multi-device delivery creates a considerable challenge for most organizations. 


• | Increasing need for scalable storage. The amount of data created each year has grown rapidly, and we believe this rapid growth in data production will create demand for flexible and scalable storage mechanisms to support growing libraries of digital content. We anticipate the need for cloud storage to increase because of the growing demand for video and other types of digital content. Organizations must consider their choice of storage solution carefully when the technology is part of a digital content delivery chain as the wrong selection can lead to incremental latency that can undermine digital experience performance.


• | The evolution of digital marketing. As the global online economy has continued to expand and grow, it has become increasingly difficult for businesses to capture consumer attention. Because of this difficulty, we anticipate that marketing will continue to evolve from “broadcast advertising” to engaging with users through conversations associated with content in a variety of places including websites and social networks. We believe this kind of engagement requires that content be increasingly comprised of video and rich media, and be delivered in a manner that meets the high user expectations for the delivery and responsiveness of digital experiences.


• | Global broadband speed increase. With each passing year, the average broadband connection speed is increasing around the world, especially as governmental agencies (such as the United States Federal Communications Commission) take an active role in ensuring that consumers have access to high-speed connections. The continued increase in speed is illustrative of consumer desire to access multimedia content (e.g. online video, game downloads, interactive web applications) through the Internet and how integral rich, digital experiences have become the way people conduct their lives on a daily basis.

Requirements for delivering effective digital experiences
We believe that the challenges of delivering digital content, particularly related to rich media, dynamic content, and applications over the Internet to a wide variety of mobile and connected devices, have created a new set of technical, management, and economic requirements for organizations seeking to succeed in the online economy. We believe those requirements include the following: 

• | Reduction of IT involvement. As businesses increasingly rely on cloud-based services they will require more intuitive web-based interfaces that enable adoption and usage of cloud-based services by the entire company or organization, regardless of location, with less direct IT support required.


• | Security. Maintaining effective security is a challenge for any enterprise that operates an online presence. Threats, denial of service attacks, viruses, and piracy can impact online web presence in many ways, including compromising personal and sensitive information, loss of customer trust and loyalty, loss of revenue, and negative publicity and brand reputation. Businesses require services that employ a number of software and network features to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to content and network-related attacks against web properties, digital content, and applications. There continues to be an increasing number of high profile security incidents that continue to raise the awareness, and strategic importance of, security in our industry.

• | Conditional access to content. Consumers increasingly expect the ability to consume any form of media content online. To meet this expectation, traditional media companies are making their enormous libraries of content, such as television shows and movies, available for viewing online. Content providers often have regulations with respect to where they can display, or store their content, due to industry requirements or geographic location. Accordingly, companies require powerful features that enable them to control where content is stored, for how long, and in what regions it can be delivered. 


• | Ability to scale capacity to handle rapidly accelerating demand. Online businesses must scale delivery of their web presence smoothly as the quantity of their site visitors or audience increases to avoid delays for users. When a large number of users simultaneously access a particular digital content asset like a video, the operator must be able to meet that surge in demand without making users wait. Rapidly accelerating demand can be related to a single event, such as a breaking news story or seasonal shopping, or can be spread across an entire library of content, such as when a social media website surges in popularity. The continued increase in video and other rich media consumption, and the growing size of digital content objects, contributes to concerns that Internet bandwidth may be supply constrained in the future.


• | Ability to easily publish and deliver online video. As the consumer demand for online video grows, businesses and organizations may be required to adopt video into their marketing messages. However, there are a host of complexities involved in developing and implementing a “video publishing workflow.” Businesses will require intuitive tools that enable them to manage their video portfolio, and quickly and efficiently publish and deliver their video content at scale with quality performance. Additionally, businesses will require that video content can be converted automatically for playing on any mobile device with the opportunity to integrate advertisements.


• | Multi-device delivery. With the increasing popularity of smartphones and tablets, businesses and organizations must ensure that their content, whether dynamic web pages or video, display properly in mobile formats. However, adding this requirement to existing content publishing workflows may greatly complicate internal processes that may result in delays for making content available to end users. Additionally, because many mobile devices have separate requirements, businesses will require features for automatically delivering correctly formatted content.


• | Reliability and Consistency. Throughout the path data must traverse to reach a user, problems with the underlying infrastructure supporting the Internet can occur. For example, servers can crash or network connections can fail. Network, datacenter, or service provider outages can mean frustrated users, lost audiences, and missed revenue opportunities. Businesses require a massively redundant network that they can depend on to ensure the reliable and consistent delivery of their digital experiences.

Our Services
We believe our integrated suite of services, coupled with our global network, are responsive to the trends driving Internet growth and address the requirements for delivering effective digital experiences. Our primary services include the following: 

• | Content delivery services improve the reliability and performance of digital content delivery by using our global network to deliver rich media files such as video, music, games, and software, or live streaming of corporate or entertainment events. We support all major formats as well as dynamic and static webpages.


• | Mobile device media delivery services help publishers deliver properly-formatted, device-optimized live and on-demand video to almost any media-enabled device by creating multiple output formats. These services automatically transform and package the live and on demand streams at the time they are requested, creating the format needed for playback by the requesting device.


• | Video content management services help organizations manage, publish, syndicate, analyze, and monetize video content through a cloud-based service. Services also include an extensible off-the-shelf video player for quick deployment and monetization features that enable customers to integrate advertising into the video playback experience.


• | Performance services improve web experiences by speeding up the loading of web pages for faster action and provide consistent performance from any geography for dynamic and personalized content, online commerce transactions, and web applications.

• | Cloud-based storage services provide customers with the scalable, redundant, geographically diverse storage of media and enterprise content, offering policies for global geographic placement, content workflow, and business logic controls while maintaining the highest levels of performance for object retrieval.


• | Cloud-based content security services mitigate a variety of attacks against websites and protect against unauthorized access or theft of content. These services include protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection, and conditional access controls that restrict access to digital content through rights management, geographic and IP address restriction and HTTP request and response flows.


• | Edge services make it easy to process, analyze, and aggregate information close to where it is being generated. These edge capabilities together with Limelight’s global private network provide fast and secure infrastructure for low-latency data processing.

Limelight Global Network
Our global network provides highly available, highly redundant storage, bandwidth, and computing resources in support of our services and solutions. This architecture, managed by our proprietary software, automatically responds to network and datacenter outages and disruptions. All of our delivery locations are interconnected via our global network and also connected to multiple Internet backbone and broadband Internet service provider (ISP) networks. This global network has three main features: 

• | Densely configured, high-capacity. Our global network consists of dense clusters of specially configured servers organized into large, multi-tiered, logical delivery locations. The extensive storage capacity of these logical locations leads to fewer cache misses to our network of servers than we believe would occur in other CDN architectures and provides significant scalability and responsiveness to surges in end-user demand. The clustering of many high-performance CPUs provides us with aggregated computational power.


• | Many connections to other networks. Our logical locations are directly connected to hundreds of ISPs and other user access networks, which are computer networks connected to end-users. In addition, for dedicated connectivity between our logical locations, we operate a dedicated fiber optic backbone and metro area networks. Also, our infrastructure has multiple connections to the Internet. In combination, these connections enable us to frequently bypass the often-congested public Internet, improving the delivery speed of content.


• | Intelligent software to manage the network. We have developed proprietary software that manages our global network. This software manages, among other things, the delivery of digital content, the retrieval of dynamic content, storage and retrieval of objects, activity logging, and information reporting.

We continue to expand our architecture through the use of “smart POPs.” These smaller POPs are less dense than our traditional densely-configured metro POPs and are designed to be quickly and more cost-effectively deployed within existing networks. In addition, we continue to explore and implement ways to improve throughput and efficiency of our infrastructure through the use of advanced technologies, hardware tuning, and software refinement that help us deliver more content, more quickly, for less cost.
Segment and Geographic Information
We operate in one industry segment, providing content delivery and related services and solutions for global businesses to help them deliver their digital content across Internet, mobile, and social channels. We operate in three geographic areas - Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, approximately 37%, 40%, and 40%, respectively, of our total revenue was derived from our operations outside the Americas. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we derived approximately 55%, 46%, and 48%, respectively of our international revenue from EMEA and approximately 45%, 54%, and 52%, respectively, of our international revenue from Asia Pacific. During 2017, we had three countries, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States that represented more than 10% of our total revenues. During 2016 and 2015, we had two countries, Japan and the United States, that represented more than 10% of our total revenues. For a description of risks attendant to our foreign operations, see the section titled “Risk Factors” set forth in Part 1, Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K. For more segment and geographic information, including revenue from customers, a measure of profit or loss, and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years, see our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including Note 21 thereto.

Sales, Service and Marketing
Our sales and service professionals are located in five offices in the United States with an additional nine office locations in EMEA and Asia Pacific. We target media, high tech, software, gaming, enterprise, and other organizations for which the delivery of digital content is critical to the success of their business. 
Our sales and service organization includes employees in telesales and field sales, professional services, account management, and solutions engineering. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 130 employees in our sales organization. Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on whether we successfully recruit, train, and retain sufficient sales, technical, and global services personnel, and how well we establish and maintain our distribution and reseller relationships. We believe that the complexity of our services will continue to require highly trained global sales and services personnel. 
To support our sales efforts and promote the Limelight brand, we conduct marketing programs. Our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign, advertisements, events and trade shows, digital marketing activities, strategic alliances, and on-going customer communication programs. As of December 31, 2017, we had 26 employees in our global marketing organization.
Customers
Our customers operate in the media, entertainment, gaming, software, enterprise, retail and other sectors. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 717 active customers worldwide, including many widely recognized names in the fields of online video, digital music, news media, games, rich media applications, and software delivery. 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had one customer, Amazon, who accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, we had no customer who accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue. In the past, the customers that comprise our top 20 customers have continually changed, and our large customers may not continue to be as significant going forward as they have been in the past. 
From time to time we have discontinued service to customers for non-payment. Although we did not receive continuing revenue from these former customers, these changes provided for a stronger mix of customers across our base, decreased our days sales outstanding, and allowed us to recoup network capacity to help meet future growth needs. We continue to focus on acquiring and retaining high quality customers across all market segments. 
Competition
We operate in the digital content delivery market, which is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. We expect this competitive environment to continue. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting this market fall into four primary categories: management, delivery, security, and metrics. 
Management for digital content is measured by the features available for managing, publishing, and delivering digital content across multiple channels and to multiple devices. 
Delivery for digital content is measured by scale and performance. We measure scale by the number of physical locations in the network and the capabilities of the network to deliver large amounts of content to locations around the world and to absorb unplanned spikes in requests for content. We measure performance by file delivery time, end-user media consumption rates, quality of the end-user experience, and scalability, both in terms of average capacity and special event capacity.
Security for digital content is measured by the features available for addressing attacks against digital properties (e.g., websites) and protecting content from unauthorized view, transmission, or access.
In addition, metrics around the ability to efficiently locate and deliver web content, the ease of implementation, the ability to customize systems for unique content types and mixes, reliability, security, consumer engagement, and cost efficiency continue to be key criteria for this market. 
The market for digital content delivery is increasingly complex and can require multiple vendors to provide customers with a complete set of tools and services to manage and deliver all of their digital content to all audiences as part of a global digital presence. We believe that in those situations where multiple vendors are required, Limelight is one of the few CDNs with the scale, performance, and reach required to deliver digital content to global audiences. We also believe the combination of cloud-based software and infrastructure/bandwidth associated with our physical global network solve multiple challenges for 
7

customers by removing the need to install, manage, or provision software and hardware to satisfy the requirements for storing and delivering digital content.
We believe our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance the performance, integration, and functionality of our existing suite of services and of our global network, and on our ability to add additional services and functionality to meet the market’s increasing expectations regarding digital content delivery and consumer engagement.
The global digital content delivery market is fragmented, but we face primary competition from Akamai, Level 3, Amazon, CDNetworks, Fastly, Highwinds and Verizon Digital Media Services. 
The principal methods of competition in this market include scale, performance, service, ease of use, product features, and price. We believe we are competitive across these dimensions. Product feature competition is intense, requiring continuous investment in innovation.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and certification of the software, hardware, and network architecture of our global network and support of our content delivery and other Limelight Orchestrate Platform solutions. As of December 31, 2017, we had 162 employees and employee equivalents in our research and development group. Our research and development personnel are primarily located in Boston, Massachusetts; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Seattle, Washington; Lviv, Ukraine, and at our headquarters in Tempe, Arizona. Our engineering efforts support product development across all of our service areas, as well as innovation related to the global network itself. We test our services to ensure scalability in times of peak demand. We use internally developed and third-party software to monitor and to improve the performance of our network in the major Internet consumer markets around the world where we provide services for our customers. Our research and development expenses were $25,342, $24,335, and $28,016 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, including stock-based compensation expense of $2,322, $2,104, and $2,236 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and other intellectual capital. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, domain registrations, and contractual protections.
As of December 31, 2017, we had received 136 patents in the United States, expiring between 2023 and 2034, and we had 2 U.S. patent applications pending. We do not have any issued patents in foreign countries. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any patents that may be issued to us may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. Therefore, we cannot predict the exact effect of having a patent with certainty.
As of December 31, 2017, we had received four trademarks in the United States. Our name, Limelight Networks, has been filed for multiple classes in the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. We have 27 non United States trademarks registered. There is a risk that pending trademark applications may not issue, and that those trademarks that have issued may be challenged by others who believe they have superior rights to the marks.
We generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including physical and electronic security, contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and domestic and foreign copyright laws.
Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights and other intellectual property rights by following sound business practices, licenses, and confidentiality agreements, there is risk that unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we have been expanding our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Further, expansion of our business with additional employees, locations, and legal jurisdictions may create greater risk that our trade secrets and proprietary rights will be harmed. If we fail to effectively protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business could be harmed.
Third parties could claim that our products or technologies infringe their proprietary rights. The Internet content delivery services industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We expect that infringement claims may further increase as the number of products, services, and competitors in our market increases. Further, 
8

continued success in this market may provide an impetus to those who might use intellectual property litigation as a weapon against us. We have been the target of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and may be the target of such claims by third parties in the future.
During 2017, we were party to the 2016 Akamai Litigations, which alleged that aspects of our content delivery network infringed upon third party patent rights. More information about the cases are described in further detail under Note 11 “Contingencies - Legal Matters" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 533 employees and employee equivalents. Of these, 364 are based in the Americas, 120 are based in EMEA and 49 are based in Asia Pacific. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have not experienced any work stoppages to date. We consider the relationships with our employees to be positive.
