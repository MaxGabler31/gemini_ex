ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
MobileSmith, Inc. (referred to herein as, “MobileSmith,” the “Company,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware in August 1993 and became a public company through a self-registration in February 2005. The Company’s common stock trades on the OTC Market (OTC.QB) under the symbol “MOST”.
 Principal Products and Services
 
MobileSmith provides operational improvement, member-facing mobile application services to the healthcare industry.   Our suite of e-health mobile solutions and related services provide a catalog of vetted mobile app tools that can be rapidly customized to fit the needs of a specific healthcare organization with goals of addressing many key pain points of the industry.  Apps built from our base app architecture ("Blueprints") focus on the following:  
● Patient's Access: improvements in hospital's HCAHPS scores (the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems score) through increased customer satisfaction from improvements in patient engagement;
  ● Patient Perioperative Care: reductions of same-day cancellations and preventable re-admissions with tailored Perioperative Apps resulting in direct savings to the hospitals; and
● In Network Patient Retention: making it easy for patients to connect with care options through ER/Urgent care and Physician Referral Apps resulting in savings to the hospitals.
 
Our services offering includes: 

  ●
  access to a catalog of ready to deploy mobile app solutions (App Blueprint Catalog);

  ●
  related deployment, support and integration services (App Build and Managed Services and custom development, where applicable) and

  ●
  hosting of the deployed mobile apps.


 Our flagship MobileSmith® Platform (the "Platform") has transformed from customer facing into an internal platform that supports the deployment of mobile apps created from Blueprints.  We also integrate various third-party code and services into the mobile apps produced from our Blueprints, host the deployed apps, and design new Blueprints that can be rapidly deployed by the Healthcare industry.

 Target Market and Sales Channels
 
 During 2017 we completed a strategic shift and focused our business and research and development activities primarily on the Healthcare industry in the United States. In 2018 we refined our healthcare focus by identifying two target markets: (i) healthcare providers (hospitals, hospital systems and the United States Veterans Health Administration) and (ii) healthcare payer market (insurance companies and insurance brokers).

 Both markets are targeted with a diversified sales workforce that includes direct sales and resellers ("channel partners"). 

Principal Customers
 
 In 2017 we had a major healthcare customer in the federal government space that accounted for 46% of our 2017 revenue. The contract with  the major government customer ended as of December 31, 2017.  Our 2018 revenue was less concentrated with no single customer comprising more than 10% of recognized revenue.  However, as we expand our relationships with channel partners in 2019,  our revenue concentration may increase again as one single channel partner may result in more revenue than sales to individual hospitals in the aggregate. Research and Development
 
In 2017 we continued to enhance the Platform with various functionalities sought by current and target customers.  We continuously monitor such demand, rapidly develop the functionalities and make them available to all our customers, current and future.
 

During 2017 and 2018 we focused our technological and design efforts on our Blueprints features, that continue leading our offering to healthcare providers  (Blueprint is a  fully customizable pre-built app targeting specific healthcare related business function or health condition)
 
 During 2019 our product development will focus on consolidating our own technology with technology of our multiple service partners (including EMR integrators, wayfinding partners, telemedicine partners) and making these consolidated technologies available through software development kits ("SDKs") and application programming interfaces ("APIs") for mass rapid consumption by the Healthcare Industry.

 Competition
 
 We have been successful in penetrating the healthcare provider technology market and developed extensive expertise in the industry.  With many of our customers we enjoy five-plus year relationships.  However, the healthcare provider technology industry is highly competitive.  Our competitors include a number of successful, independent companies, such as Vivify Health, mPulse, and AMC Health.  Many of these companies have significantly greater financial, personnel, and other resources than we do.  Moreover, more companies enter the industry and market every year.  As a result of this, we expect the competition we face to grow stronger in the next five years.Intellectual Property
 
During 2014, we stopped pursuing the majority of our patent applications as we determined that the cost of pursuing them is greater than the potential protection provided by them.  Since then we have been granted one patent associated with our Platform.
 
We also have several trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These trademarks cover certain names that identify specifics of the Platform user interface.
 
 Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 26 full time employees and no part-time employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
