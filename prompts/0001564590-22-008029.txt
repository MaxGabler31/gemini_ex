Item 1. Business. 
 Since our inception in 2012, our mission has been to help clients and communities meet their environmental goals and needs. Today, we have emerged as one of the fastest growing companies in a highly fragmented and growing $1.3 trillion global environmental industry. 
 We service complex and often non-discretionary environmental needs of our diverse clients across our three business segments: Assessment, Permitting and Response; Measurement and Analysis; and Remediation and Reuse. Examples of our services include: 
 


Our industry is highly fragmented with no single market leader. By focusing on environmental solutions, we believe we are uniquely positioned to become a leading platform in the industry. We provide a diverse range of environmental services to our private and public sector clients across the life cycle of their needs—whether they are launching new projects, maintaining operations, decommissioning operations, rehabilitating assets, managing the impacts of climate change or responding to unexpected environmental disruption. Our integrated platform has been a catalyst for our organic growth and we have built on this platform through strategic acquisitions. 
 Innovation is core to our strategy. The world’s environmental challenges continue to grow in number, scope and complexity, and mounting public pressure and regulatory changes continue to drive demand for better information and solutions. We focus on innovation in order to improve the quality of information we can provide to clients (such as more accurately measuring methane and greenhouse gas emissions or identifying variations of Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in water) and provide better solutions to their environmental needs (such as the efficient removal of PFAS from contaminated water). We intend to continue innovating by investing in research, development, software development, and technology (directly and through strategic partnerships) to develop better solutions for our clients. We believe these investments—together with our investments in geographic expansion, sales and marketing initiatives, environmental service offerings and strategic acquisitions—will continue to distinguish us in the marketplace. 
 Our revenue and earnings are highly resilient. We are not dependent upon any single service, product, political approach or regulatory framework. We also serve a diverse set of over 5,400 clients across a wide variety of end 
 4


markets and geographies within the private and public sectors. Funding for our services is typically non-discretionary given regulatory drivers and public health concerns. As a result, our business is positioned to be less susceptible to political and economic cycles. 
 Our financial success is driven by both strong organic and acquisition-driven growth. Our total revenue growth for the full year 2021 was 66% of which 10% was due to acquisitions completed in 2021 and 21% was due to revenue from CTEH in the first quarter of 2021 (CTEH was acquired on April 1, 2020). Including organic revenue growth from CTEH, our environmental response business, our organic revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 37%. Excluding CTEH, our organic revenue growth was 17% in the year ended December 31, 2021. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Key Factors that Affect our Business and Results—Organic Growth.” In addition, our acquisitions of selected environmental services firms have expanded our geographic reach and service offerings. 
 Our environmental focus and reputation have enabled us to attract and retain some of the most highly sought-after employees in our industry. These employees have contributed to our organic growth, differentiated brand, reputation and culture. 
 We have experienced strong growth over the past several years. Our revenue increased from $114.8 million in 2016 to $546.4 million in 2021, representing a 37% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR. Over the same period, we had a net loss of $8.9 million and $25.3 million in 2016 and 2021, respectively, and our adjusted EBITDA increased from $7.3 million in 2016 to $77.6 million in 2021, representing a CAGR of 60%. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Information” for a discussion of non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation thereof to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 Our approach has allowed us to successfully and consistently scale our business, and we believe we are well positioned to continue our trajectory and market leadership as we address the growing environmental needs of our clients and communities. 
 The Industry 
 The environmental industry is large, growing, highly fragmented and subject to complex regulatory frameworks. Federal, state, provincial and local environmental regulations dictate compliance requirements that create demand for environmental services. Increasingly, public and stockholder interest in environmental sustainability is also driving prudent management of our shared and finite environmental resources. 
Global Environmental Industry is Large and Growing 
 According to data derived from a 2021 Environmental Industry Study prepared by Environmental Business International, Inc., or EBI, which we commissioned, the global environmental industry is estimated to be approximately $1.3 trillion, with $428 billion concentrated in the United States. According to EBI, this $428 billion U.S. environmental market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.4% per year from 2021 through 2024. Positive growth is expected across all environmental sectors in the global market. 
Public Demands, Industrial Activity, Climate Change and Regulations Each Increase Need for Environmental Services 
 Heightened public awareness and increasing stakeholder demand for environmental sustainability has increased the need and demand for environmental services. Many companies around the world have implemented initiatives on Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility, or CSR, and Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, making environmental impact a core factor in many business decisions. These initiatives are often focused on managing potential future risks, as opposed to past emphasis on regulatory compliance. 
 Steady increases in industrial activity and infrastructure investment, and the regulations underpinning these activities, are also driving demand for environmental services. In addition, environmental disruptions caused by 
 5


climate change or aging infrastructure drive demand for environmental services. Infrastructure investments and environmental emergency responses often require substantial assessments, planning and/or permitting services in addition to environmental testing or remediation services. Testing and monitoring are typically recurring processes driven by regulations throughout the industrial production process. 
 In addition to current regulations, future regulatory changes may also drive demand for additional or different environmental services. In the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, the federal, state, provincial and local regulations targeting air and water quality management, waste and contaminated soil management or reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, each of which drives portions of our business, have been implemented over many decades, and are subject to change. 
 We expect these trends to continue and to spur future growth in the environmental services industry. 
 The Environmental Services Industry is Highly Fragmented and Complex 
 According to EBI, thousands of firms operate in many of the markets in which we operate. Several larger firms provide environmental services as a part of their broader product portfolio. However, much of the industry is served by small firms that provide limited service offerings addressing specific regulations and geographies. It is difficult for small firms to expand given the technical expertise, accreditations and licenses necessary to serve a broad array of clients and industries across geographies and service lines. These dynamics create significant barriers to entry in our industry. 
 As clients increasingly focus on environmental solutions to address their impact on the environment, we believe they value environmental solutions providers with scale, technology and broad service capabilities. Providers able to address the full lifecycle of environmental concerns and needs, particularly for companies and organizations with multi-jurisdictional footprints subject to complex regulatory frameworks and impacts across environmental media (e.g., air, water and soil) will continue to enjoy competitive advantages. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 We are a leading global brand focused on environmental services with a resilient revenue base anchored on long-term client relationships. Our focus on innovation, our ability to acquire and integrate leading companies, our highly accredited businesses and our experienced and credentialed team provide our clients with quality solutions and create significant barriers to entry. Our competitive strengths include: 
Resilient Revenue Across Political and Economic Cycles 
 Our revenues are largely resilient over political cycles primarily because our business is not dependent on any one industry, geography or regulatory framework. We have a diversified client and geographic footprint, and we often help clients comply with multiple regulatory frameworks. As a result, we are often insulated from major shifts in individual federal, state, provincial and local regulations. While federal governments set certain minimum standards, many state, provincial or local policies are more stringent. In addition, state, provincial and local governments often define how environmental standards will be met or implemented. These different levels of government often serve as counterweights to each other and minimize the risk and impact of sudden shifts in policy. 
 We believe our diverse portfolio of services and end markets also positions us to be resilient across economic cycles. For example, clients use our services when launching development projects, while maintaining ongoing operations, when decommissioning operations, and when remediating the release of contaminants into air, water or soil. These client activities can occur at different times for different industries, regardless of economic cycles. In addition, many of our service offerings are typically non-discretionary and our projects often create significant economic value for our clients (in the form of reduced liability, cost savings or revenue streams), further incentivizing the continued use of our services. Furthermore, community demands, such as those for PFAS-free water or better air quality monitoring in disadvantaged communities surrounding industrial facilities, continue regardless of political or economic cycles. As another example, during the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders, most of our services were deemed essential and continued to be requested by clients. Though there were some delays in the scheduling of certain services due to travel restrictions or social distancing requirements, primarily in the second 
 6


quarter of 2020, the environmental and/or regulatory implications of not completing environmental projects has resulted in a resilient demand for our services.
Including revenues generated by CTEH, whose clients do not necessarily recur each year due to the emergency response nature of their services, clients generating over 86% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 repeated in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding revenues generated by CTEH, clients generating over 90% of revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 repeated in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Similarly, clients generating over 90% of revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 repeated in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Long-term Relationships Across a Large and Diversified Client Base 
 We currently serve over 5,400 clients. We have long-standing relationships with a number of Fortune 1000 companies and government entities, and our legacy acquired businesses have been operating for as long as a century. 
 We provide services to our largest clients across multiple projects and/or multiple locations, and the number of services we provide to these clients varies from one project per year to several dozen projects per year. With the exception of CTEH, whose environmental response business may at times experience higher customer concentration levels based on the severity, duration and outcome of certain types of environmental emergencies for which we provide response services, our revenues are not dependent on any one single client or industry. In fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, our largest client represented approximately 10% of revenue, with those revenues being generated by more than 20 separate projects. Further, the Media industry, the industry from which we generated the most revenue in 2021 represented 32% of total revenue, with the majority of revenue in that industry derived from COVID-19 related work performed by CTEH. Excluding CTEH, no single industry comprised more than 19% of revenue. 
 For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 90% of our 2021 revenues were generated from the private sector and approximately 10% from the public sector. 
 Differentiated Technology, Processes and Applications 
 Our focus on innovation and on accessing and developing proprietary technologies, processes and applications is a key competitive advantage and differentiator of our brand and services. These innovative tools complement our professionals’ years of experience, technical expertise and industry knowledge and bolster the solutions we provide our clients. We have consistently used technology and process advancements across geographies, to accelerate growth and to address our clients’ environmental concerns. 
 In fiscal year 2021, our Research and Development team was awarded four patents related to water treatment technology.  In addition, with the acquisition of SensibleIoT in the summer of 2021, our software and environmental sensor connectivity platform targeting air and water quality continued to advance.
 Significant Scale with Global Reach 
 Clients value our ability to provide coordinated, diversified services across many geographies, including domestic and international geographies that reach beyond our approximately 80 locations. Through our strategic acquisitions and targeted recruiting, we have achieved a scale that combines knowledge of local environments and regulations with global reach, which positions us to win and execute our projects globally. As a result, we expect to continue to capture market share. 
 Our global footprint supports our ability to gain market share by attracting new clients and by expanding offerings to our existing clients. As clients seek environmental solutions providers able to address the life cycle of their environmental concerns and needs across jurisdictions, we believe our footprint and diversified portfolio of services position us well to attract and retain clients, and expand our relationships with those clients over time. 
 Our scale has enabled us to leverage our investments in technology, innovation and process resources in a way that we believe will continue to support our industry leadership position.

Proven Ability to Identify, Execute and Integrate Acquisitions 
 We have acquired and integrated over 60 businesses over the last nine years, and we intend to continue selectively acquiring companies in our industry. Key characteristics of past and expected acquisition targets include quality management teams, complementary services, access to differentiated technologies and extension of our geographic reach. 
 We believe we add value to the businesses we acquire by introducing a culture focused on teamwork and innovation, and by providing superior operating discipline. As a result of our focus on integration, our acquired businesses typically begin contributing to our organic growth after the first year following acquisition. Post-acquisition performance is typically driven by revenue synergies as demonstrated by our consistent organic revenue growth. 
 We maintain a robust acquisition pipeline primarily driven by word of mouth and existing relationships. As we have to-date, we intend to continue acquiring businesses at disciplined valuation levels. We believe our approach to acquisitions will enable us to continue creating substantial value for all our stakeholders. 
 Experienced Management Team Coupled with a Team-Centric Culture 
 Our leadership and culture define who we are. Our senior leadership team includes industry pioneers who have led a number of industry organizations and are considered among the foremost experts in the environmental services industry. The average tenure of our operational leadership in the environmental industry is more than 25 years. Our key executives and board members also have extensive experience in growing businesses both organically and through acquisitions. 
 Our management and employees share a passion for the environment and a compassion for each other. We again received the National Safety Council Award in 2021 in recognition of our excellence in safety across our business. In addition, our employees’ dedication to supporting each other has led to the establishment of The Montrose Community Foundation, a non-profit organization formed and operated by our employees for the benefit of our employees. Through its volunteer board, The Montrose Community Foundation uses employee donations to provide resources to our employees in times of need. Our employees’ dedication of personal time and resources solely for the benefit of their colleagues exemplifies our team-oriented culture. 
 We believe it is our strong management team and our culture that enables us to attract and retain our exceptional talent. 
 Growth Strategies 
 Our goal is to become a global leader in the growing environmental services industry. We expect to continue growing organically by maintaining and expanding existing client relationships, developing new client relationships and investing in sales and marketing infrastructure. We also expect to continue growing by strategically acquiring companies in our highly fragmented industry. Our proven ability to recruit and retain industry leaders and innovators across all our business segments will further contribute to our growth. We believe these growth strategies position us well to capture market share from competitors and accelerate beyond our industry’s attractive growth profile. 
Continue Organic Growth 
  
• | Expand existing local relationships into national and international relationships: Many of our clients have a broad national and international presence. Historically, these clients have often managed their environmental programs locally using regional service providers. However, these clients often have a desire to minimize the number of vendors they work with and standardize their programs across geographies, which requires their environmental services providers to have the scale, reach and capabilities to match their footprint. Meeting this need is challenging for many in our industry given their regional focus and limited service offerings. Our geographic reach, strong relationships and reputation for quality enable us to address our clients’ ever-growing and diverse needs in a way most of our regional competitors cannot. As a result, we have generated many intra-client referrals and won new

• | Sell additional environmental services to existing clients: Many of our clients have historically hired us for a specific environmental service such as environmental audits or tests. As we have diversified our service offerings, and as clients have grown accustomed to the quality and consistency that our teams provide, clients have increasingly engaged us to perform additional environmental services. As a result, we have won new business historically served by competitors that are typically single service-line focused. We expect to continue cross-selling additional environmental services to existing clients with multidimensional needs, including where we can replace services provided in-house.

• | Provide sales training and deploy a targeted sales team to drive growth and acquire new clients: We are investing in our dedicated sales capabilities and intend to continue these efforts. We are providing sales and account management training to our technical practitioners, investing in customer relationship management systems and building sector-specific sales teams to help identify new clients and capture market share from competitors. We believe a targeted investment in sales and marketing will help facilitate cross selling across our products and geographies, and support ongoing market share capture within each individual environmental service.

• | Build Montrose brand awareness and marketing strategy: We believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for environmental solutions. We continue to expand and centralize our marketing resources to support both corporate and business-line specific needs, adding personnel, processes, and tools to drive brand awareness. Anchored on a content marketing strategy where we provide relevant, technical information through story-driven campaigns, our goal is to engage specific customers and support our sales teams with data-driven insights. Though our brand awareness is rapidly improving, our technical capabilities remain broadly unknown to most prospective customers; therefore, we believe our investments in brand development remain very additive to our ability to recruit talent, generate organic growth, and ultimately can create shareholder value.

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions 
 The environmental services industry is highly fragmented and has no single leading brand. Through strategic acquisitions, we can continue to accelerate our growth, brand development and market leadership. Over the last nine years, we have acquired and integrated over 60 businesses that have provided us with talent, complementary services, access to differentiated technologies and geographic reach. Most of our acquisitions were initiated with personal introductions given our favorable reputation in the market. We believe our ability to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions and retain talent has been and remains a key driver of our operational and financial success. 
 Our pipeline of potential future acquisitions is robust, and we plan to continue pursuing acquisitions to enhance our strategic and competitive positions in existing and new markets. 
 Recruit and Retain Industry Leaders 
 Given the highly technical nature of many of our services, our ability to recruit and retain talent enhances our ability to capture market share. We believe our mission and focus on the environment, our emphasis on ownership 
 9


opportunities for our employees and our team of renowned industry leaders creates a competitive advantage when competing for talent. 
 Segments 
 We provide environmental services to our clients through our integrated solutions across three business segments—Assessment, Permitting and Response, Measurement and Analysis and Remediation and Reuse. 
 

Assessment, Permitting and Response. Our Assessment, Permitting and Response segment provides scientific advisory and consulting services to support environmental assessments, environmental emergency response and recovery, toxicology consulting and environmental audits and permits for current operations, facility upgrades, new projects, decommissioning projects and development projects. We work closely with clients to navigate the regulatory process at the local, state, provincial and federal levels, identify the potential environmental and political impacts of their decisions and develop practical mitigation approaches, as needed. In addition to environmental toxicology, and given our expertise in helping businesses plan for and respond to disruptions, our scientists and response teams have helped clients navigate their preparation for and response to COVID-19 infections. 
 We believe this segment maintains a number of competitive advantages, including: 
  
• | strong brands and market leadership, particularly with environmental preparedness and response;

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This segment, which is primarily based on a fixed price and, for out-of-scope work, a T&M revenue model, generated approximately 28% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Remediation and Reuse. Our Remediation and Reuse segment provides clients with engineering, design, implementation and operations and maintenance services, primarily to treat contaminated water, remove contaminants from soil or create biogas from waste. Nearly 400 of our employees, including engineers, scientists and consultants, provide these services to assist our clients in designing solutions, managing products and mitigating environmental risks and liabilities at their locations. We do not own the properties or facilities at which we implement these projects or the underlying liabilities, nor do we own material amounts of the equipment used in projects. 
 We believe this segment’s competitive advantages include: 
  
• | strong brands;
--+---------------


• | advanced technologies and our owned and licensed intellectual property portfolio, such as our patented water treatment systems and proprietary process to optimize the generation of biogas;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Differentiated Technology, Processes and Applications 
 Advanced technology and innovative processes and applications are key competitive advantages in the environmental services industry. Our team of industry leaders are integral drivers of our investments in differentiated services. As our brand and environmental platform grows, our experts are increasingly able to deploy innovative technologies that address our clients’ needs, further differentiate our services and create new barriers to entry. Recent examples of our investment and development activities are related to real time air quality and methane emissions monitoring, environmental data management and visualization software, and PFAS removal and destruction technologies.
Strategic Acquisitions 
 We operate in a growing and highly fragmented market with thousands of potential acquisition targets. Given our success in identifying, executing and integrating more than 60 acquisitions since our inception in 2012, we believe we can continue to selectively acquire additive businesses. We seek to acquire businesses at disciplined valuation levels that: 

(1) | are led by high quality scientists and management teams,
----+---------------------------------------------------------


(2) | expand our portfolio of services,
----+----------------------------------


(3) | provide access to differentiated technologies or processes, and

We believe we add value to the businesses we acquire by emphasizing a team-centric culture focused on innovation and investment, expanding career opportunities for new employees from smaller businesses, providing a larger eco-system of environmental services and capabilities to further client relationships, and implementing award-winning safety programs and operating processes. Each business we acquire is systematically integrated into our systems and processes, thereby creating revenue synergy opportunities and operating leverage. 
 Clients 
 We provide environmental services to over 5,400 clients operating in a number of sectors and industries, including but not limited to technology, media, chemicals, energy (oil, gas and/or petrochemical), power and utilities, industrials and manufacturing, financial services, and engineering services as well as local, state, provincial and federal government entities. We have long-term, and through our legacy companies, decades-old relationships. We serve a diversified client base in both the private and public sectors. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues were derived approximately 90% from the private sector and 10% from the public sector. 
 Our largest client represented approximately 10% of revenue for fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, with these revenues derived from over twenty separate projects. As a result of the nature of CTEH’s environmental response business, our Assessment, Permitting and Response segment may at times experience higher customer concentration levels based on the severity, duration and outcome of certain types of environmental emergencies for which we provide response services, as was the case in 2021 when 68% of CTEH’s revenues were attributable to three customers, each of whom engaged CTEH in connection with COVID-19 response support. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
 Contracts 
 Our client contracts are generally fixed price, including milestone-based fixed price contracts in our Remediation and Reuse segment, and, for out-of-scope work, T&M based. Our Assessment, Permitting and Response client contracts are generally T&M based. Our client contracts vary from purchase-order based contracts utilizing standard terms and conditions to comprehensive master services agreements with terms of multiple years. In accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts, both in the private and public sector, are subject to termination at the discretion of the client. In such situations, our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Competition 
 We operate in a competitive, but fragmented, market. No single company or group of companies dominates across the entire environmental services market in which we operate. Our primary competitors are divisions of large companies, various small companies which generally are limited to a specific service and focused on a niche market or geographic region and our clients’ own in-house resources. We believe that few, if any, of our competitors currently provide the full range of environmental solutions that we offer. Instead, each of our segments has competitors with narrower service offerings and/or geographies. Our Assessment, Permitting and Response segment competitors include the environmental divisions of Ramboll, TRG, Geosyntec, Exponent, and other small businesses. Our Measurement and Analysis segment competitors include the environmental divisions of SGS, Bureau Veritas, Eurofins, Pace Analytical and environmental divisions of large testing companies and other small businesses. Our Remediation and Reuse segment competitors include the environmental divisions or remediation segments of Tetratech, AECOM, WSP, other large engineering companies and other small businesses. 
 We compete based on the following factors, among others: reputation, safety track record, quality, geographic reach, price, technical capabilities, access to innovative technology and breadth of services. We believe that our current capabilities position us to compete favorably in each of these factors.

The environmental services industry has significant barriers to entry which would make it difficult for new competitors to enter the market. These barriers include: 
  
• | highly technical, costly and time-consuming accreditation and licensure requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to deploy/services client needs across geographies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | advanced quality and safety programs and mandated scores;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | the complex and geographically varying regulatory landscape that requires significant industry experience;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the need to acquire or develop innovative technologies and processes that are acceptable to regulatory bodies, which in our case occurred over many years of client and regulator engagements and at significant research and development expense; and

• | emphasis by large clients on size and scale, length of relationship and past service record.

Intellectual Property 
 We utilize a combination of intellectual property safeguards, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and licenses, as well as employee and third-party confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property. However, we do not principally rely on any single piece of intellectual property, nor is any single piece of intellectual property material to our financial condition or results of operations. 
Seasonality 
 Because demand for environmental services is not driven by specific or predictable patterns in one or more fiscal quarters, our business is better assessed based on yearly results. In addition, our operating results experience some quarterly variability. Excluding the impact of revenues and earnings from new acquisitions, and the temporary impact of COVID, including revenues derived from COVID-19 related projects, we typically generate slightly lower revenues and lower earnings in the first and fourth quarters and higher overall revenues and earnings in the second and third quarters. Historically, quarterly variability has been driven by weather patterns, which generally impact our field-based teams’ ability to operate in the winter months. As we continue to grow and expand into new geographies and service lines, quarterly variability may deviate from historical trends. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,500 employees, including approximately 1,800 full-time employees in the United States. Approximately 97% of our full-time employees work in our U.S. operations and approximately 3% work in foreign operations. None of our facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
Human Capital Resources
 At the heart of our employee-centric model is our focus on recruiting, developing, and retaining top talent and skills. In 2021, we built and launched a contemporary talent recruitment and management platform that has dynamic, automated workflows, enabling us to successfully recruit, hire and develop top talent while meeting compliance requirements across geographies and jurisdictions. Having a diverse, fair and inclusive workforce is core to our values and our university outreach and job board platforms attract a diverse pool of candidates to our organization.

We have also updated policies and practices and implemented anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training. In addition, we have put in place affirmative action plans in line with our principles and compliance requirements. 
 In an effort to build communication and transparency with our teams, we formalized business communications in 2021 with quarterly division-specific newsletters, CEO video updates, and SVP-led townhalls. Each of these communication vehicles provides employees with access to information about company, including business or financial updates, new projects or teams, division specific updates, and departmental news.
 Diversity, Fairness and Inclusion 
 We have established a Diversity, Fairness and Inclusion, or DF&I, task force and program. In doing so, we have committed to the establishment and formalization of employee development and policies that support diversity, inclusion and fairness. The DF&I task force completed a 2021 survey of employees to assess the areas of opportunity for the Company. The task force is working with our executive leadership team and divisional leadership teams to propose changes in policies or work practices. Recent changes to policy include the additional of floating holidays to the Company’s vacation policy, an increase in COVID-19 leave time, and various diversity, fairness and inclusion efforts globally.
 We LEAD 
 The Montrose Environmental Group Women Empowering Leadership, or WeLEAD, program, which was established in January 2020, is focused on fostering the recruitment, retention and professional development of women at our company. Our WeLEAD program is developing an alliance of women leaders across Montrose, with a key emphasis on mentorship and talent development.  Since the program’s inception, a formal pay parity effort was launched across the organization to support equal pay across job titles and functions, both for existing employees and for new hires going forward. In addition, several prominent female leaders have been promoted into senior roles within the Company’s science and engineering departments, policy recommendations have been submitted to promote the development and retention of female talent (e.g., parental leave policy changes), and female Board members have been added to the Company’s Board of Directors. Further to its mission, WeLEAD coordinates a formal mentorship program for women leaders within our Company, with approximately 100 employees participating in the 2021-2022 annual program.
 Training and Development
 Our employee development efforts aim to provide employees and leaders with the tools and skills they need to succeed and advance personally and professionally. Key operations and sales executives participated in a Leadership Coaching and Mentorship program. We also conducted 360-degree feedback surveys to identify key leader strengths and development opportunities. Finally, we take steps for our new hires and existing employees to complete our training programs and review all of our training activities and curricula annually to incorporate any necessary updates.
Pay Equity
 We strive to maintain pay equity for comparable roles, experience and performance that is independent of employee race, gender, sexual orientation or other personal characteristics. With the support of third party advisors and experts, we provide what we believe are fair and competitive compensation practices by developing and maintaining a market-aligned salary and benefits structure for each job level and in each geography where we operate.    
Equity Incentives
 As part of our dedication and commitment to motivating and rewarding our employees, we offer equity incentives to a large number of our employees under our stock incentive plans. We believe strongly in employee ownership of Montrose and we believe our approach creates value for our clients, for our employees, for the communities in which our employees live, and for our shareholders.

Engagement
 Our employees’ dedication to supporting each other has led to the establishment of The Montrose Community Foundation, a non-profit organization formed and operated by our employees for the benefit of our employees, in 2016. Through its volunteer board, The Montrose Community Foundation uses employee donations to provide resources to our employees in times of need. Our employees’ dedication of personal time and resources solely for the benefit of their colleagues exemplifies our team-oriented culture.
Health, Safety and Wellness
 We offer a spectrum of benefit plans to meet the needs of our diverse employee population, including health, dental, vision, life insurance, and various supplemental plans.
 In 2020, we first established a COVID-19 task force whose purpose was and is to help keep employees informed on the virus, its impacts, and methods to minimize and manage infections. Flexible working arrangements, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) resources and a 24/7 emergency response hotline were made available to our teams across the globe. In response to the global COVID pandemic, we provided employees with paid time off to help address their personal or family needs during an unprecedented time. Additionally, we incentivized employees to get vaccinated by offering a $100 payment for getting vaccinated. These resources and initiatives continue to be available to all employees.
 Our culture of safety and wellbeing of our employees is supported by a dedicated team of health and safety professionals. 
 Across our organization, we demonstrate our strong commitment of safety to our employees with frequent communications and systems that actively engage employees and encourage all employee's input and involvement.  The foundation of the safety program focuses on ensuring that our employees are sufficiently trained to perform their job duties, have properly operating equipment including correct Personal Protective Equipment such as gloves, eyewear and respirators, job hazards are properly identified, mitigated and planned for prior to work commencement, and the entire process is documented to validate and improve performance. All employee time associated with safety preparation and training is fully paid to employees.  Current initiatives include driving safety, job safety planning and job hazard analysis.  Further to our commitment to our employees, we employ a third party occupational medical provider that is available to all employees 24/7 to discuss occupational health concerns. Finally, all of our employees have complete stop work authority and can stop any project or task if there is any concern about a safety issue without any fear of retribution.
 Our dedication and commitment to safety have resulted in us again receiving the National Safety Council Award in 2021 in recognition of our excellence in safety across our business.
 Compliance with Federal, State/Provincial and Local Laws 
 Our operations subject us to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we operate, including the United States, Australia and Canada. Such laws and regulations relate to, among other things, the discharge of wastewater, the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the handling, storage, use, transport, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and solid, hazardous and other wastes and workplace health and safety. These laws and regulations impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on some of our operations and the services we provide. The failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third-party claims, damage to property or natural resources and personal injury claims, requirements to investigate or cleanup property or to pay for the costs of investigation or cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders requiring corrective measures, and could negatively impact our reputation with clients. We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that, in the opinion of management, are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 A portion of our revenue is derived from working with the U.S. federal government. When working with U.S. governmental agencies and entities, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts. Internationally, we are subject to various government laws and regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations).

To help promote compliance with these and other laws and regulations, our employees are sometimes required to complete tailored ethics and other compliance training relevant to their position and our operations.
