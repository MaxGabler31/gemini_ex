ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
NIC is a leading provider of digital government services that help governments use technology to provide a higher level of service to businesses and citizens and increase efficiencies. We accomplish this currently through two channels: our primary outsourced portal businesses and our software & services businesses. In our primary outsourced portal businesses, we generally enter into multi-year contracts with state and local governments to design, build, and operate internet-based solutions on an enterprise-wide basis on a government's behalf. These digital government solutions allow businesses and citizens to access government information online via a variety of connected devices and complete secure transactions, such as applying for a permit, retrieving government records, or filing a government-mandated form or report. The business model supporting most of our long-term contracts is a transaction-based business model where we absorb the costs to build the technical infrastructure and develop digital government services. After a service has launched, we and our government partners share a portion of the fees generated from the online transactions, which are paid by the end users of the service. Our government partners benefit by reducing their financial and technological risks, increasing their operational efficiencies,

avoiding costs and gaining a centralized, customer focused presence on the internet, while businesses and citizens receive a faster, more convenient, and more cost-effective means to interact with government. We are typically responsible for funding the up-front investments and ongoing operations and maintenance costs of the digital government solutions.
We typically enter into multi-year contracts with our government partners and manage operations for each contractual relationship through separate local subsidiaries that operate as decentralized businesses with a high degree of autonomy. Our business plan is to increase our revenues by delivering new services to a growing number of government entities within our existing contractual relationships and by signing long-term contracts with new government partners.
Our software & services businesses primarily include our subsidiaries that provide software development and digital government services, other than outsourced on an enterprise-wide basis, to state and local governments as well as federal agencies.
Segment Information
Our Outsourced Portals segment is our only reportable segment and generally includes our subsidiaries that provide digital government services on an enterprise-wide basis for state and local governments. The Other Software & Services category primarily includes our subsidiaries that provide software development, payment processing and other digital government services, other than outsourced on an enterprise-wide basis, to state and local governments as well as federal agencies. For additional information relating to our reportable and operating segments, refer to Note 13, Reportable Segments and Related Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Industry Background
The market for business-to-government and citizen-to-government transactions
Government regulation of commercial and consumer activities requires billions of transactions and exchanges of large volumes of information between government agencies and the businesses they regulate and the citizens they serve. These transactions and exchanges include, but are not limited to, motor vehicle driver history record retrieval, motor vehicle registrations, tax returns, permit applications and requests for government-gathered information. Government agencies typically defray the cost of processing these transactions and of storing, retrieving, and distributing information through a combination of general tax revenues, service fees and charges for direct access to public records.
The limits of traditional government transaction methods
Traditionally, government agencies have transacted, and in many cases, continue to transact, with businesses and citizens using processes that are inconvenient and labor-intensive, require extensive paperwork, and use outmoded technology and security procedures and large amounts of scarce staff resources. Transactions and information requests are often made in person or by mail, which increases the potential for the compromise of sensitive personal information or errors that require revisions and follow-ups, particularly if the transactions and information requested are processed manually. Even newer methods rely on multiple systems and potentially incompatible data formats and require significant expertise and expenditures to introduce and maintain. As a result, businesses and citizens often have no choice but to face costly delays to complete essential tasks. These delays include waiting in line at a government agency, for answers by telephone, for responses by mail, or for payments by check. In addition, government agencies may not use modern secure methods of online payment, leaving businesses and citizens unable to pay certain fees online or at the counter using credit/debit cards or electronic checks, or government agencies may require advance payments rather than payments from monthly billing. Businesses and citizens encounter further inconvenience and delay because they can usually work with government agencies only during normal business hours. Even when online alternatives are available, they often require a cumbersome process of multiple contacts with different government agencies or offer a limited number of payment methods. Increases in the level of economic activity and in the population have exacerbated these problems and increased the demand for new services.

Challenges to the implementation of digital government services
Despite the potential benefits of digital government services, barriers to creating successful internet-based services may preclude governments from implementing them. Some of these barriers are similar to those the private sector encounters, including:

• | the high cost of implementing and maintaining secure infrastructure in a budget-constrained environment;


• | the need to quickly assess the requirements of potential customers and cost-effectively design and implement digital government services that are tailored to meet these requirements;


• | the intense competition for qualified technical personnel; and


• | the need for updated internet and mobile friendly payment methods, that are secure and compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”).

Governments also face some unique challenges that exacerbate the difficulty of advancing digital services, including:

• | lengthy and potentially politically charged appropriations processes that make it difficult for governments to acquire resources and to develop digital services quickly;


• | a diverse and substantially autonomous group of government agencies that have adopted varying and fragmented approaches to providing information and transactions online;


• | a lack of marketing expertise to design services that meet the needs of businesses and citizens, to increase the awareness of the availability of the services and to drive adoption of the online service delivery channel;


• | security and privacy concerns that are amplified by the confidential nature of the information and transactions available from and conducted with governments and the view that government information is part of the public trust;


• | changes in administration and turnover in government personnel among influencers and key decision makers; and


• | compliance requirements associated with accepting credit/debit card and electronic check payments.

We believe many private sector service providers generally do not address the unique requirements of digital government services. Most service providers do not fully understand and are not well-equipped to deal with the unique political, regulatory and security environments of governments. These providers, including large systems integrators, frequently take a time-and-materials, project-based pricing approach or provide “off-the-shelf” solutions, often designed for other industries that may not adequately address the needs of government.
What We Provide to Governments
We provide digital government services designed to meet the needs of governments, businesses and citizens. The key elements of our service delivery are:
Customer-focused, one-stop government
Using our marketing and technical expertise and our government experience, we generally design, build, and operate digital government services for our government partners that are designed to meet their needs as well as those of the businesses and citizens they serve. Our enterprise-wide portals are designed to create a single point of presence online that allows businesses and citizens to reach every government agency in a specific jurisdiction from one online location. We strive to employ a common look and feel for all government agencies associated with each state’s internet-based solutions and make them useful, appealing and easy to use. We also develop applications that allow businesses and citizens to complete processes that have traditionally required separate offline interactions with several different government agencies or older generation electronic access. These applications permit businesses and citizens to conduct transactions with government agencies and to obtain information 24 hours per day and seven days per week using the latest technology and payment methods. We also

help our government partners generate awareness and educate businesses and citizens about the availability and potential benefits of digital government services.
Compelling and flexible financial models for governments
With our business model, we allow governments to implement digital government services at minimal cost and risk. We take on the responsibility and cost of designing, building and operating digital government services, with minimal use of government resources. We employ our technological resources and accumulated expertise to help governments avoid the risks of selecting and investing in new and often untested technologies that may be implemented by unproven third-party providers. We implement our services rapidly, efficiently and accurately, using our well-tested and reliable infrastructure and processes. Once we establish a portal and the associated applications, we typically manage transaction flows, data exchange and payment processing, and we fund ongoing costs from the fees received from end users, who access information and conduct transactions through the portal. We are also able to provide specific fee-based applications, software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions and other digital solutions to governments who cannot or do not wish to use a transaction-based funding model.
Focused relationship with governments
We form relationships with governments by developing an in-depth understanding of their interests and then aligning our interests with theirs. By tying our revenues to the development of successful services and applications, we demonstrate to government agencies and constituents that we are focused on their needs. Moreover, we have pioneered and encourage our partners to adopt a model for digital government policymaking that involves the formation of oversight boards to bring together interested government agencies, business and consumer groups and other vested interest constituencies in a single forum. We work within this forum to maintain constant contact with government agencies and constituents and enlist their participation in the development of digital government services. We attempt to understand and facilitate the resolution of potential disputes among these participants to maximize the benefits of our services. We also design our services to observe relevant privacy and security regulations, so that they meet the same high standards of integrity, confidentiality and public service as government agencies strive to observe in their own actions.

Our state master contracts typically authorize our subsidiaries to design, build and operate a wide range of digital government services that facilitate interactions between government agencies and businesses or citizens. These are typically multi-year contracts that permit any state agency to engage our local subsidiary to develop and provide digital services by executing a statement of work, subject to the approval and oversight of our master contract partner or an oversight authority established by the master contract or applicable law. In many cases, our subsidiaries are also able to use these contracts to provide services for county and city governments within the state. Under the transaction-funded business model most commonly contemplated in these master contracts, our subsidiaries earn revenue through transaction fees paid by users in exchange for access to the services that we provide. These charges support the operation and maintenance of the services, as well as compensate our subsidiaries for the up-front investment and ongoing costs incurred in developing and maintaining the services, all costs that would otherwise be incurred by the state. Our subsidiaries also utilize a portion of the revenue from these fees to develop additional digital government services that cannot be supported through transaction-based funding, either because the service would not have sufficient use, or the type of service is not compatible with charging a fee.
We typically own the intellectual property in connection with the applications we develop under our state enterprise-wide contracts. After completion of a defined contract term, our government partner typically receives a perpetual, royalty-free license to use the applications and digital government services we built only in its own state. However, certain proprietary customer management, billing, and payment processing software applications that we have developed and standardized centrally and that are utilized by our portal businesses, are provided to the vast majority of our government partners on a SaaS basis, and thus would not be included in any royalty-free license. If our contract expires after a defined term or if our contract is terminated by our government partner for cause, the government partner would be entitled to take over the services in place, and NIC would have no future revenue from, or obligation to, such former government partner, except as otherwise provided in the contract. In our portal business we also provide services to certain states (New Mexico and Texas) where we do not maintain an enterprise-wide digital government services contract. In some cases, we enter into contracts to provide application development and portal management services to governments in exchange for an agreed-upon fee.
We also enter into statements of work with various agencies and divisions of our government partners for digital access to data and to conduct other citizen-to-government and business-to-government transactions. These statements of work preliminarily establish the pricing of the online transactions and data access services we provide and the amounts we must remit to the agency. These terms are then submitted to the policy-making and fee approval authority for approval. Generally, our contracts provide that the amount of any fees we retain is set by governments to provide us with a reasonable return or profit. We have limited control over the level of fees we are permitted to retain. Any changes made to the amount or percentage of fees retained by us, or to the amounts charged for the services offered, could materially affect the profitability of the respective contract. We have the general ability to control certain of our expenses in the event of a reduction in the amount or percentage of fees we retain; however, there may be a lag in the time it takes to do so should we determine it is necessary.
Any renewal of these contracts beyond the initial term by the government is optional and a government may terminate its contract prior to the expiration date if we breach a material contractual obligation and fail to cure such breach within a specified period or upon the occurrence of other events or circumstances specified in the contract. In addition, 15 contracts under which we provide enterprise-wide digital government services, as well as our contract with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ("FMCSA"), can be terminated by the other party without cause on a specified period of notice. Collectively, revenues generated from these contracts represented approximately 45% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. In the event any of these contracts are terminated without cause, the terms of the respective contract may require the government to pay us a fee in order to continue to use our applications in its portal.
Outsourced federal contract
Our subsidiary, NIC Federal, LLC (“NIC Federal”), within our software & services business, has a contract with the FMCSA to develop and manage the FMCSA’s Pre-Employment Screening Program (“PSP”) for motor carriers nationwide, using the Company’s transaction-based business model. In February 2019, the FMCSA extended the current contract through August 27, 2019, which includes three six-month renewal options.
The loss of the contract as a result of the expiration, termination or failure to renew the contract, if not replaced, could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability. Any changes made to the amount or percentage of fees retained by us, or to the amounts charged for the services offered, could materially affect the profitability of this contract.
6

Expiring contracts
We currently have 10 contracts under which we provide enterprise-wide digital government services, as well as our contract with the FMCSA, that have expiration dates within the 12-month period following December 31, 2018. Although certain of these contracts have renewal provisions, any renewal is at the option of our government partners, who may choose to not renew the contract, to re-open bidding for the services, to take over the services in place and provide services internally, or to allow individual government agencies to retain the services of their own providers. Collectively, revenues generated from these contracts represented approximately 31% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. As described above, if a contract expires after a defined term, the government partner would be entitled to take over the services in place, and NIC would have no future revenue from, or obligation to, such former government partner, except as otherwise provided in the contract.
As previously disclosed, Texas NICUSA, LLC (“Texas NICUSA”) was selected to provide payment processing services set forth in the Texas.gov 3.0 Procurement RFO (the “Texas RFO”) but was not selected to provide enterprise-wide services for portal operations, maintenance and development. The legacy contract between the state of Texas and Texas NICUSA expired on August 31, 2018 and the new payment processing services contract commenced on September 1, 2018. The legacy Texas contract accounted for approximately 14%, 20% and 20% of our total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, revenues from the legacy Texas contract were approximately $49.0 million, $65.7 million and $62.2 million, respectively.
The contract under which our subsidiary, NICUSA Inc. (“NICUSA”), managed digital government services for the state of Tennessee expired on March 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenues from the Tennessee contract were approximately $1.8 million and $7.5 million, respectively.
The contract under which our subsidiary, Iowa Interactive, LLC (“II”), managed digital government services for the state of Iowa expired on June 30, 2016. II provided transition services as required by the contract through November 30, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues from the Iowa contract were approximately $1.6 million.
Sources of Revenues
We currently earn revenues from three main sources: transaction-based fees, software development and services and portal management. Each of these revenue types are further described below. 

• | Transaction-based:


▪ | IGS: our portal business earns transaction-based fees, which are generally recurring, from interactive government services, referred to as IGS, from sources other than digital access to motor vehicle driver history records, for transactions conducted by business users and consumer users through our services.


▪ | DHR: our portal business earns transaction-based fees, which are generally recurring, from driver history records, referred to as DHR, for providing digital access to motor vehicle driver history records from our partner states to data resellers, insurance companies, and other pre-authorized customers on behalf of our state partners.


▪ | Other: our software & services business earns a significant portion of its revenues from transaction-based fees, which are generally recurring, most notably via NIC Federal's contract with the FMCSA to develop and manage the PSP for motor carriers nationwide.


• | Software development and services: we earn revenues from the performance of software development projects and other time and materials services for our government partners. While we actively market these services, they do not have the same degree of predictability as our transaction-based or portal management revenues and are generally not recurring.


• | Portal management: we earn revenues, which are generally recurring, from the performance of fixed fee portal management services for our government partner in the state of Indiana.

The following table reflects the underlying sources of revenues as a percentage of total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31:

Percentage of Revenues: | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Transaction-based | 95 | % | | 95 | % | 94 | %
Software development & services | 4 | % | | 3 | % | 4 | %
Portal management | 1 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %

The following table identifies each type of service, consumer and state that accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues in any of the past three years:

 | Percentage of Total Consolidated Revenues
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Type of Service | | | | | 
Motor Vehicle Driver History Record Retrieval | 29 | % | | 31 | % | 33 | %
(This is the highest volume, most commercially valuable service the Company offers) | | | | | 
Motor Vehicle Registrations | 14 | % | | 14 | % | 14 | %
Consumer | | | | | 
LexisNexis Risk Solutions | 19 | % | | 19 | % | 22 | %
(Resells motor vehicle driver history records to the insurance industry) | | | | | 
State Partner | | | | | 
Texas | 17 | % | | 20 | % | 20 | %
(2018 consists of the legacy and new payment processing contracts) | | | | | 

Our government partners enter into contracts with data resellers, including various contracts with LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which are generally self-renewing until canceled by one side or the other, and generally may be terminated at any time after a 30-day notice. These contracts may be terminated immediately at the option of any party upon a material breach of the contract by the other party. Furthermore, these contracts are immediately terminable if the state statute allowing for the public release of these records is repealed.
Service Offerings
We work with our state and local government partners to develop, manage, and enhance comprehensive, enterprise-wide, digital government services for their constituents. Our enterprise-wide portals are designed to provide user-friendly, convenient, secure multi-channel access, including mobile access, to in-demand government information and services, and include numerous fee-based transaction services and applications that we have developed. These fee-based services and applications allow businesses and citizens to access constantly changing government information and to file necessary government documents. The types of services and the fees charged vary according to the unique preferences of that jurisdiction. To reduce the frustration businesses and citizens often encounter when dealing with multiple government agencies, we handle cross-agency communications whenever feasible and shield businesses and citizens from the complexity of older, mainframe-based systems that agencies commonly use, creating an intuitive and efficient interaction with governments. We also provide industry-compliant payment processing systems that accommodate credit/debit cards and electronic checks, as applicable. Some of the higher volume and in-demand digital government services we offer in different jurisdictions include:

Sales and Marketing
We have two primary sales and marketing goals:

• | to develop new sources of revenues through new government relationships; and


• | to retain and grow our revenue streams from existing government relationships.

We have well-established sales and marketing processes for achieving these goals, which are managed by our national sales division and a dedicated marketing function within most of our subsidiaries.
Developing new sources of revenue
We focus our new government sales and marketing efforts on increasing the number of federal, state and local government agencies that desire to make government more accessible and efficient for all by delivering information and/or completing transactions in new and innovative ways. We meet regularly with information technology, business and policy officials at all levels of government to educate them on the services we offer to drive digital government innovation and transformation for their jurisdictions.
We have a dedicated and experienced sales team focused on our top sales priorities at the federal and state level, including enterprise, digital government opportunities using our proven transaction-based funding model, as well as alternative funding models, and agency-level digital government services under a variety of flexible funding models.
We are regular speakers at conferences all over the country devoted to using innovation to facilitate the relationship between governments and the citizens and businesses they serve. In addition to cultivating relationships with federal, state, and local government officials, we also develop supportive and educational relationships with professional and business organizations that may benefit from digital government improvements and new digital services we can deploy. Finally, we focus our corporate marketing efforts on key government decision makers using advertising, white paper development, media relations and social media.
Once a government decides to implement digital services, it typically starts a selection process that operates under special procurement rules that apply to government purchasing. These rules typically require open bidding by possible service providers against a list of requirements established by the government under existing procedures or procedures specifically created for the service provider selection process. We respond to requests for bids with a proposal that details our philosophy, experience, and specific plans for implementing our services and business models. Once our proposal is selected, we enter into negotiations for a contract.
Growing existing markets
In our existing federal, state and local government relationships, our marketing efforts focus on:
10


• | expanding the number of government agencies and localities that provide digital government services;


• | identifying new government services that can be usefully and cost-effectively delivered digitally; and


• | increasing the number of users who conduct business digitally with governments.

Although each government’s unique political and economic environment drives different marketing and development priorities, we have found many of our core applications to be relevant across multiple jurisdictions. Most of our subsidiaries have a dedicated director of marketing and additional marketing staff who meet regularly with government, business and consumer representatives to discuss potential new services and promote existing services. We also promote the use of our extensive library of unique digital government services to existing and new customers through speaking engagements and targeted advertising to organizations for professionals, including lawyers, bankers and insurance agents who have a need for regular digital interaction with government. We identify services that have been developed and implemented successfully for one government and replicate them in other jurisdictions.
Technology and Operations
For more than 25 years, we have made substantial investments in the development of internet-based and mobile applications and operations specifically designed to allow businesses and citizens to transact with and receive information from governments online. The scope of our technological expertise includes network engineering as it applies to the interconnection of government systems to the internet, internet security, web-to-legacy system integration, web-to-mainframe integration, web-to-mobile integration, database design, website administration, web page development and payment processing. Within this scope, we have developed and implemented a comprehensive framework for governments, and a broad array of stand-alone configurable platforms and products along with services using a combination of our own proprietary technologies and commercially available, licensed technologies. We believe that our technological expertise, coupled with our in-depth understanding of governmental processes and systems, has made us adept at rapidly creating tailored digital government services that keep our partners on the forefront of technology.
Each of our government partners has unique priorities and needs in the development of its digital government services. More than half of our employees work in the internet services, application development and technology operations areas, and most are focused on a single government partner’s technology needs. Our employees develop an understanding of a specific government’s application priorities, technical profiles and information technology personnel and management. At the same time, our development directors are trained by experienced technical staff from our other operations, and there is frequent communication and collaboration, which ensures that our government partners can make use of the most advanced digital government services we have developed throughout our organization.
The majority of our portal infrastructure and applications are hosted at a central data facility operated by a third-party, with backup at a similar facility in another location. Some of our portal infrastructure and applications are physically hosted in each jurisdiction in which we operate on servers that we own or lease, or in a third-party cloud environment. We also provide links to sites that are maintained by government agencies or organizations that we do not manage. Our objective is to provide uninterrupted online service 24 hours per day and seven days a week, and our operations maintain extensive backup, security and disaster recovery procedures.
History has proven that our systems and applications are scalable and can easily be replicated from one government entity to another. We focus on sustaining low-overhead operations, with all major investments driven by the objective of deploying the highest value-added technology and applications to each operation.
Finally, we have designed our digital government solutions and services to be compatible with virtually any existing system and to be rapidly deployable. To enable speed and efficiency of deployment, we license commercially available technology whenever possible and focus on the integration and configuration of these “off-the-shelf” hardware and software components when necessary. While we expect that commercially licensed technology will continue to be available at reasonable costs, there can be no assurance that the licenses for such third-party technologies will not be terminated or that we will be able to license third-party technology and applications for future services. While we do not believe that any one individual technology or application we license is material to our business, changes in or the loss of third-party licenses could lead to a material increase in the costs of licensing or to our products becoming inoperable or their performance being materially 
11

reduced, with the result that we may need to incur additional development or procurement costs to help ensure continued performance of our services.
We regard our intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements with governments, our employees, subcontractors and other third parties, copyrights and privacy and trade secret laws to protect and limit the distribution of the proprietary software applications, documentation and processes we have developed in connection with the digital government services we offer.
Competition
Historically, we have not faced significant competition from companies vying to provide transaction-funded enterprise-wide digital services to governments; however, we face intense competition from companies providing point solutions and platforms to individual government agencies. We believe that the principal factors upon which our businesses compete are:

• | our unique understanding of government needs;


• | the quality and fit of our digital government services;


• | speed and responsiveness to the needs of businesses and citizens;


• | a proven transaction-based business model that is cost-effective; and


• | our enterprise-wide approach.

We believe we compete favorably with respect to the above-listed factors. In most cases, the principal alternative for our enterprise-wide services is a government-designed and managed service that integrates multiple vendors’ technologies, products and services. Companies that have expertise in marketing and providing technology services to government entities compete with us by further developing their services and increasing their focus on agency-specific segments of their business. 
Additionally, in some geographic areas, we may face agency-level competition from firms with established reputations and political relationships with potential government partners. Examples of companies that may compete and/or currently compete with us at the enterprise and agency level are the following:

• | traditional large systems integrators and consulting firms, including Deloitte, Accenture, IBM, CGI and Unisys;


• | traditional large software applications developers, including Microsoft and Oracle;


• | digital transaction payment processors, including ACI Worldwide, Inc. and Link2Gov Corp;


• | software application developers, including Accela, FAST Enterprises and GCR Inc.; and


• | other niche providers, such as Aspira, Sovereign Sportsman Solutions, Brandt Information Services and Appriss.

Seasonality
The use of some of our digital government services is seasonal, particularly the accessing of motor vehicle driver history records, resulting in lower revenues from this service in the fourth quarter of each calendar year, due to the lower number of business days in this quarter and a lower volume of transactions during the holiday periods.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 920 full-time employees, of which approximately 320 were working in corporate operations and approximately 600 were in our outsourced portal and software & services businesses. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel. We also employ independent contractors to support our application development, marketing, sales

and administrative departments. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
