 Our operations are managed in two reportable segments reflecting our internal management reporting structure and nature of services offered as follows:
 Environmental Services—This segment provides a broad range of hazardous material management services including transportation, recycling, treatment and disposal of hazardous, non‑hazardous and radioactive waste at Company‑owned landfill, wastewater, deep-well injection and other treatment facilities.
 Field & Industrial Services—This segment provides packaging and collection of hazardous waste and total waste management solutions at customer sites and through our 10‑day transfer facilities. Services include on‑site management, waste characterization, transportation and disposal of non‑hazardous and hazardous waste. This segment also provides specialty field services such as industrial cleaning and maintenance, remediation, lab packs, retail services, transportation, emergency response and other services to commercial and industrial facilities and to government entities.
 Environmental Services Segment
 Our Environmental Services involve the transportation, treatment, recycling and disposal of hazardous, non‑hazardous and radioactive wastes, and include physical treatment, recycling, landfill and deep-well injection disposal and wastewater treatment services. Waste Treatment & Disposal
 We recycle, treat and dispose of hazardous and non‑hazardous industrial wastes. The wastes handled include substances which are classified as “hazardous” because of their corrosive, ignitable, reactive or toxic properties, and other wastes subject to federal, state and provincial environmental regulation. The wastes we handle come in solid, liquid and sludge form and can be received in a variety of containerized and bulk forms and transported to our facilities by truck and rail.
 We own and operate five permitted hazardous waste treatment and disposal landfills in the United States and Canada used primarily for the disposal of wastes treated at Company‑owned onsite and offsite treatment facilities. The United States landfills are regulated under RCRA by the respective states in which they are located and the USEPA while our Canadian landfill is regulated by the Québec Ministry of Environment. We also operate a commercial LLRW landfill in Richland, Washington that is licensed by the Washington Department of Health through delegated authority of the NRC. The WUTC sets disposal rates for LLRW. Rates are set at an amount sufficient to cover operating costs and provide us with a reasonable profit. The current rate agreement with the WUTC was extended in 2013 and is effective until January 1, 2020.
 As of December 31, 2018, the capacity used in the calculation of the useful economic lives of our six landfills includes approximately 45.5 million cubic yards of remaining permitted airspace capacity and approximately 18.1 million cubic yards of additional unpermitted airspace capacity included in the footprints of these landfills. We believe it is probable that this unpermitted airspace capacity will be permitted in the future based on our analysis of site conditions, past regulatory approvals on adjacent property, and our interactions with regulators on applicable regulations, although there can be no assurance that any additional unpermitted airspace capacity will be permitted in the future.
 Treatment and disposal (“T&D”) revenue can be broken down into two categories, based on the underlying nature of the revenue source: “Base Business” and “Event Business.”
 Base Business consists of waste streams from ongoing industrial activities and tends to be reoccurring in nature. Our strategy is to expand our Base Business while securing both short-term and extended-duration Event Business. We define Event Business as non‑recurring projects that are expected to equal or exceed 1,000 tons, with Base Business defined as all other business not meeting the definition of Event Business. The duration of Event Business projects can last from a several‑week cleanup of a contaminated site to a multiple year cleanup project.
 Base Business represented approximately 80% and 78% of disposal revenue (excluding transportation) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Event Business contributed approximately 20% and 22% of disposal revenue (excluding transportation) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

 When Base Business covers our fixed overhead costs, a significant portion of disposal revenue generated from Event Business is generally realized as operating income and net income. This strategy takes advantage of the operating leverage inherent to the largely fixed‑cost nature of the waste disposal business. Contribution margin is influenced by whether the waste is directly disposed (“direct disposal”) or requires the application of chemical reagents, absorbents or other additives (variable costs) to treat the waste prior to disposal.
 A significant portion of our T&D revenue is attributable to discrete Event Business projects which vary widely in size, duration and unit pricing. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 20% of our T&D revenue was derived from Event Business projects. The one‑time nature of Event Business, diverse spectrum of waste types received and widely varying unit pricing necessarily creates variability in revenue and earnings. This variability may be influenced by general and industry‑specific economic conditions, funding availability, changes in laws and regulations, government enforcement actions or court orders, public controversy, litigation, weather, commercial real estate, closed military bases and other project timing, government appropriation and funding cycles and other factors. The types and amounts of Base Business waste received also vary quarter to quarter, sometimes significantly, but are generally more predictable than Event Business.
 The types of waste received, also referred to as “service mix,” can produce significant quarter‑to‑quarter and year‑to‑year variations in revenue, average selling price, gross profit, gross margin, operating profit and net income for both Base Business and Event Business.
 Deep-Well Injection
 We operate a caprock injection well in the southern United States with full Class 1 and 2 non-hazardous industrial waste disposal capabilities. Utilizing proprietary low pressure injection technology, the deep-well asset provides the unique ability to efficiently dispose of difficult to treat non-hazardous industrial waste streams, including high metals, high ammonia, high solids, flammable exempt, and leachate.  Based on an independent determination of the injection capacity of the caprock formation in which we inject waste and our own estimates of projected injection volumes, we believe the remaining disposal capacity of the formation will be sufficient to meet our disposal needs for the foreseeable future.
 Wastewater Treatment
 We operate wastewater treatment facilities that offer a range of wastewater treatment technologies. These wastewater treatment operations involve processing hazardous and non‑hazardous wastes through the use of physical and chemical treatment methods. Our wastewater treatment facilities treat a broad range of industrial liquid and semi‑liquid wastes containing heavy metals, organics and suspended solids.

     Recycling Services
 We operate recycling technologies designed to reclaim valuable commodities from hazardous waste, including oil‑bearing waste, metal‑bearing waste, batteries, electronics, airport deicing fluid and other solvent‑based wastes for industrial clients. The recycling and reclamation process involves the treatment of wastes using various recovery methods to effectively remove contaminants from the original material to restore its usefulness and to reduce the volume of waste requiring disposal.
 We offer full‑service storm water management and propylene glycol recovery at major airports. Recovered fluids are transported to our RCRA Part B and CWT permitted chemical recycling facility where they are recycled into a greater than 99% pure material that is sold to industrial users.
 We also operate a thermal desorption unit at our Robstown, Texas facility that recovers oil and metal bearing catalyst from refinery and other organic and oil-based waste. The recycled oil and recycled catalyst are sold to third parties.
 Transportation
 For waste transported by rail from locations distant from our facilities, transportation‑related revenue can vary significantly and can account for as significant portion of total project revenue. While bundling transportation and disposal services may reduce overall gross profit as a percentage of total revenue (“gross margin”), this value‑added service has allowed us to win multiple projects that we believe we could not have otherwise competed for successfully. Our Company‑owned fleet of gondola railcars, which is periodically supplemented with railcars obtained under operating leases, has reduced our transportation expenses by largely eliminating reliance on more costly short‑term rentals. These Company‑owned railcars also help us to win business during times of demand‑driven railcar scarcity. We also utilize a variety of specially designed and constructed Company‑owned tanker trucks and trailers as well as various third‑party transporters to support this activity. Further, to maximize utilization of our railcar fleet, we periodically deploy available railcars to transport waste from cleanup sites to disposal facilities operated by other companies. Such transportation services may also be bundled with logistics and field services support work. Field & Industrial Services Segment
 Our Field & Industrial Services include a wide range of industrial maintenance and specialty services at refineries, chemical plants, steel and automotive plants, and other government, commercial and industrial facilities. Onsite specialty services include industrial cleaning and maintenance, remediation, lab pack, transportation and emergency response. We provide these services through a network of facilities located throughout the United States that are organized into service lines including Small Quantity Generation, Remediation Services, Managed Services, Emergency Response, Transfer and Processing, Terminal Services and Industrial Services. Small Quantity Generation
 Our small quantity generation service offerings consist of retail services, laboratory packing, less than truckload (“LTL”), and household hazardous waste (“HHW”) collection. Retail services, laboratory packing, LTL and HHW are full‑service waste characterization, packaging, collection and transportation programs. Services are provided to small, medium and large industrial and commercial customers. These programs are built on our network of service centers, employ highly trained staff and provide a high level of service to the customer. As an integral part of our services, we operate a network of service centers that characterize, package and collect hazardous and non‑hazardous wastes from customers and transport such wastes to and between our facilities for treatment or bulking for shipment to final disposal locations. Customers typically accumulate wastes in containers, such as 55 gallon drums, bulk storage tanks or 20 cubic yard roll‑off containers. We utilize a variety of specially designed and constructed tank trucks and semi‑trailers as well as third‑party transporters, including railroads. Depending on customer needs and competitive economics, transportation services may be offered at or near our cost to help secure new business.

 Remediation Services
 Our remediation service offerings include project management, RCRA and TSCA closures, excavations, wastewater management, building decontamination, landfill capping and site remediation.
 Managed Services
 Our managed service offerings consist of total waste management (“TWM”) programs. Through our TWM program, customers outsource the management of their waste compliance program to us, allowing us to organize and coordinate their waste management disposal activities and environmental compliance. Emergency Response
 Our primary emergency response offerings include spill response, waste analysis and treatment and disposal planning. We also offer remediation, product transfers, spill contingency planning and yearly service agreements with first responder status. Trained, experienced professionals operate the Company’s Emergency Response Service 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Transfer and Processing
 Our transfer and processing stations stage and consolidate non‑bulk loads of hazardous, non‑hazardous and universal waste into full loads for more efficient shipment to Company‑owned or third‑party treatment and disposal facilities. This allows us to offer a broader geographic presence without having a dedicated, Company‑owned treatment or disposal facility in the region. Terminal Services
 Our terminal services include petroleum and chemical tank cleaning and other services, including emergency response, construction and industrial maintenance. The Company services several major petroleum terminals around New York Harbor. Industrial Services
 Our primary industrial service offerings include industrial cleaning and maintenance for refineries, chemical plants, steel and automotive plants, as well as tank cleaning and temporary storage. Waste Services Industry
 During the 1970s and 1980s, waste services industry growth in the United States was driven by new environmental laws and actions by federal and state agencies to regulate existing hazardous waste management facilities and direct the cleanup of contaminated sites under the federal Superfund law. By the early 1990s, excess hazardous waste management capacity had been constructed by the industry. Over this same period, to better manage risk and reduce expenses, many waste generators instituted industrial process changes and other methods to reduce waste production. These factors led to highly competitive market conditions that still apply today.
 In the U.S., hazardous waste is regulated under the RCRA, which created a cradle‑to‑grave system governing defined hazardous waste from the point of generation to ultimate disposal. RCRA requires waste generators to distinguish between “hazardous” and “non‑hazardous” wastes, and to treat, store and dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with specific regulations. Generally, entities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste must obtain a permit, either from the USEPA or from a state agency to which the USEPA has delegated such authority. Similar regulations and management methods apply to hazardous waste generation in Canada, which is regulated by the Canada Ministry of Environment and delegated to provincial agencies.

 Disposal facilities are typically designed to permanently contain the waste and prevent the release of harmful pollutants into the environment. The most common hazardous waste disposal practice is placement in an engineered disposal unit such as a landfill, surface impoundment or deep-well injection. RCRA’s hazardous waste permitting program establishes specific requirements that must be followed when managing those wastes.
 We believe that a baseline demand for hazardous and non-hazardous waste services will continue into the future with fluctuations driven by general and industry‑specific economic conditions, identification and prioritization of new cleanup needs, cleanup project schedules, funding availability, regulatory changes and other public policy decisions. We will also continue to advance plans and business lines that promote sustainable recycling technologies and expect the recycling portion of our business to displace some of our base disposal services over time. We further believe that the ability to deliver specialized niche services while aggressively competing for large volume cleanup projects and non‑niche commodity business opportunities differentiates successful from less successful companies. We seek to control variable costs, expand service lines, increase waste throughput efficiency, employ innovative treatment techniques, provide complementary transportation and logistics services, build market share and increase profitability.
 Our Richland, Washington disposal facility, serving the Northwest and Rocky Mountain LLRW Compacts, is one of three operating Compact disposal facilities in the U.S. While our Washington disposal facility has substantial unused capacity, it can only accept LLRW from the 11 western states comprising the two Compacts served. The Barnwell, South Carolina site, operated by Energy Solutions, Inc. (“Energy Solutions”), exclusively serves the three‑state Atlantic Compact. A third LLRW disposal facility, licensed by Waste Control Specialists, LLC and located near Andrews, Texas serves the two‑state Texas Compact and approved out‑of‑compact waste generators. Class A LLRW from states outside the Northwest Compact region may also be disposed at the commercial disposal site in Clive, Utah, also operated by Energy Solutions.
 Increases in pricing at AEA licensed LLRW disposal facilities heightened demand for more cost‑effective disposal options for soil, debris, consumer products, industrial wastes and other materials containing LARM, including “mixed wastes,” exhibiting both hazardous and radioactive properties. In addition to commercial demand, a substantial amount of LARM is generated by government cleanup projects. The NRC, USEPA and USACE have authorized the use of hazardous waste disposal facilities to dispose of certain LARM, encouraging expansion of this compliant, cost‑effective alternative. We have been successful at expanding our permits at four of our RCRA hazardous waste facilities to allow acceptance of additional LARM wastes.
 Industrial Services Industry
 The industrial services industry is highly fragmented with thousands of small companies performing a variety of cleaning, maintenance and other services to industrial based companies such as refineries, chemical plants and steel and automotive plants. We believe customers increasingly desire to shift high fixed costs to lower variable costs by outsourcing waste management and industrial services. Some companies, such as power generation plants, petroleum refineries and chemical processors, are required to perform specialized “turnaround” maintenance only once or twice per year, making it impractical and cost‑prohibitive to purchase expensive, specialized equipment, comply with complex permits and employ full‑time specialized technicians required to perform those services. Similarly, the regulatory requirements of characterizing, manifesting, transporting and properly disposing of waste has led many companies to outsource this function to specialists. Our network of service centers and treatment, recycling and storage facilities provides a national footprint allowing us to serve these customers, while at the same time internalizing the waste to our own facilities.
 Industrial services generally have low barriers to entry and customers are frequently won based on quality of service, reputation, health and safety record, logistics and price. This low barrier to entry has fostered a fragmented and competitive market place.
 Strategy
 Our strategy is to capitalize on our difficult‑to‑replicate combination of treatment, recycling and disposal assets and complementary service lines to provide a full service offering to customers and increase market share in the diverse markets we serve. We are focused on safety, environmental compliance and a commitment to customer service excellence. In 

 
  10

 
addition to organic growth initiatives, we actively pursue acquisition opportunities to expand our geographic reach, service lines and customer base. The principal elements of our business strategy are to:
 Execute Best‑in‑Class Safety and Environmental Compliance Programs. We pursue best‑in‑class safety and environmental compliance at US Ecology. Not only is it the cornerstone of our business, but our customers and regulators rely on our expertise when they select us as a vendor or grant us permits and licenses. We deploy significant resources in terms of human capital, programs and facility investment to achieve safe and compliant operations. The Company has dedicated professionals who oversee and manage safety and environmental programs including, but not limited to, employee training, internal and independent external audits, incentive programs and the Safety & Health Achievement Recognition Program. Various US Ecology facilities have obtained third-party verification of Environmental Health and Safety programs through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (“OSHA”) Voluntary Protection Program (“VPP”) or ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 accreditation. Senior managers regularly review and discuss environmental and safety results and performance with operational staff, management and the Board of Directors to improve our safety results and focus on regulatory compliance.
 Leverage Regulatory Expertise to Expand Permit Capabilities and Broaden Cost‑Effective Service Offerings. We have a proven track record of leveraging more than six decades of regulatory experience to broaden our service offerings. Working with customers, we assess market opportunities in relation to existing laws, regulations and permit conditions. Our engineering, operational and regulatory affairs personnel then seek authority to implement innovative processes and technologies and accept additional types of waste by modifying our existing permits or obtaining new permits.
 Continue to Build on Our Robust Waste Handling Infrastructure to Increase Revenue from Existing Assets. We believe we have a difficult to replicate set of treatment, recycling and disposal assets in the highly regulated hazardous and radioactive waste industry. We aim to enhance treatment capabilities at our existing facilities to handle additional waste streams and increase throughput. We also continue to invest in equipment and infrastructure to ensure that we have ample throughput capacity to expand our Event Business while continuing to support our Base Business customers.
 Execute on Marketing Initiatives to Grow Organically. Our sales team is focused on high margin, niche wastes that our competitors may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory authorizations for or handle cost‑effectively. We seek to expand into new markets and offer new services allowing us to cross‑sell or bundle services and ultimately drive incremental volume into our existing disposal facilities. Our strategy is to have our Base Business cover our fixed overhead costs and deliver a reasonable profit, which allows the majority of our Event Business revenue to be realized as operating profit. We aim to continue building our Base Business while remaining flexible enough to handle large cleanup events.
 Deliver Innovative Technological Solutions. We challenge ourselves to identify innovative and technology‑driven solutions to solve our customers’ waste management challenges. Past examples include leveraging our expertise in developing waste treatment recipes for organic and metals‑bearing wastes, utilizing waste as a reagent to treat other wastes, beneficial reuse of select wastes, partnering with an innovative technology provider to deploy thermal desorption technology to recover oil and metal catalyst from refinery waste, and stabilizing mercury laden waste and other wastes using patented treatment process.
 Pursue a Disciplined Acquisition Strategy to Add Complementary Capabilities. We pursue selective acquisitions to expand our disposal network, customer base and geographic footprint. We have had success achieving this in recent years through our targeted acquisition strategy, acquiring EQ Holdings, Inc. (“EQ”) in 2014, Environmental Services Inc. (“ESI”) and the Vernon, California based RCRA Part B, liquids and solids waste treatment and storage facility of Evoqua Water Technologies LLC in 2016 and ES&H of Dallas, LLC (“ES&H Dallas”) and Ecoserv Industrial Disposal, LLC (“Winnie”) in 2018. The acquisition of EQ also provided us with an entirely new line of complementary field and industrial service offerings. We continue to seek acquisition opportunities to further expand our service offerings across the hazardous waste value chain while maintaining our commitment to compliance, safety and customer service excellence.
 Competitive Strengths
 Difficult‑to‑Replicate Infrastructure. We consider our disposal facilities to be difficult to replicate due to the longstanding regulatory and public policy environment for hazardous waste processing facilities, which includes the generally high cost 

 
  11

 
of obtaining permits, multi‑year permitting timeframes, uncertainty of outcome, high initial capital expenditures and the potential for both broad‑based and local community opposition to the development of new facilities. As a result, it has been more than 20 years since a new hazardous waste landfill has been built in the United States. We operate five of twenty landfills in the U.S. and Canada that are permitted to accept RCRA wastes. Our Richland, Washington LLRW facility is one of only three full‑service Class A, B, and C disposal facilities in the U.S. Our personnel have extensive experience safely managing certain radioactive waste requiring the use of shielding and remote handling devices.
 Significant Regulatory and Operating Expertise. We operate in a highly regulated marketplace. The permitting process for operating disposal assets in our industry is lengthy and complex, requiring a deep understanding of federal and state hazardous and radioactive waste laws and regulations. We maintain a regulatory compliance and permitting program at our disposal facilities that has allowed us to obtain approvals to expand our service offering in terms of the types, amounts and concentrations of wastes that we are authorized to accept. Our track record of successfully navigating government regulatory and permitting processes has been a consistent competitive advantage.
 A Market Leader in Hazardous & Non‑Hazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal. We are a leader in the North American hazardous waste services sector with more than six decades of experience. Our collection of disposal assets combined with our transportation network provides us with coast‑to‑coast treatment and disposal capabilities, allowing us to serve a diverse mix of customers and industries across the United States, Canada and Mexico.
 Comprehensive Waste Services. Our comprehensive waste service offerings allow us to act as a full‑service provider to our customers. Our full‑service orientation creates incremental revenue growth as customers seek to minimize the number of outside vendors through “one‑stop” service providers.
 Diverse Markets and Customer Base. In 2018, we serviced more than 3,500 commercial and governmental entities, such as refineries, chemical production facilities, heavy manufacturers, steel mills, waste brokers and medical and academic institutions. Our broad range of end‑markets gives us exposure to a variety of industrial cycles, lessening the impact of market volatility.
 Solid Safety and Compliance Record. Safety and environmental compliance is a cornerstone of US Ecology’s business. The Company has dedicated professionals who oversee and manage safety and environmental programs including, but not limited to, employee training, internal and independent external audits, incentive programs and the Safety & Health Achievement Recognition Program. Various US Ecology facilities have obtained third-party verification of Environmental Health and Safety programs through OSHA’s VPP or ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 accreditation. Senior managers regularly review and discuss environmental and safety results and performance with operational staff, management and the Board of Directors to improve our safety results and focus on regulatory compliance.
 Competition
 Our Environmental Services segment competes with large and small companies in each of the commercial markets we serve. While niche services apply, the radioactive, hazardous and non‑hazardous industrial waste management industry is generally very competitive. We believe that our primary hazardous waste and PCB disposal competitors are Clean Harbors, Inc., Heritage Environmental Services and Waste Management, Inc. Other hazardous waste disposal competitors include, but are not limited to, Envirosafe Services of Ohio, Tradebe, Ross Environmental, Perma‑Fix Environmental Services and Veolia Environmental Services. We believe that our primary radioactive material disposal competitors are Energy Solutions, Inc. and Waste Control Specialists, Inc. We believe the principal competitive factors applicable to these businesses are:
· | price;
--+-------


· | specialized permits and “niche” service offerings;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | customer service;
--+------------------


· | operational efficiency and technical expertise;

--+-----------------------------


· | state or province and local community support.
--+-----------------------------------------------

  Competition within our Field & Industrial Services segment varies by locality and type of service rendered, with competition coming from large national and regional service providers and hundreds of privately‑owned firms that offer field or industrial services. We believe that our primary field and industrial services competitors are Clean Harbors, Inc., Stericycle, Inc., Veolia Environmental Services and Waste Management, Inc. Each of these competitors is able to provide most if not all of the field and industrial services we offer.
 We believe that we are competitive in all markets we serve and that we offer a unique mix of services, including niche technologies and services that favorably distinguish us from competitors. We also believe that our strong brand name recognition from six decades of experience, compliance and safety record, customer service reputation and positive relations with regulators and local communities enhance our competitive position. Advantages exist for competitors that are larger in scale or have technology, permits or equipment to handle a broader range of waste, that operate in jurisdictions imposing lower disposal fees and/or are located closer to where wastes are generated.
 Permits, Licenses and Regulatory Requirements
 Obtaining authorization to construct and operate new hazardous or radioactive waste facilities is a lengthy and complex process. We believe we have demonstrated significant expertise in this area over multiple decades. We also believe we possess all permits, licenses and regulatory approvals required to maintain regulatory compliance and operate our facilities and have the specialized expertise required to obtain additional approvals to continue growing our business in the future.
 We incur costs and make capital investments to comply with environmental regulations. These regulations require that we operate our facilities in accordance with permit‑specific requirements. Most of our facilities are also required to provide financial assurance for closure and post‑closure obligations should our facilities cease operations. Both human resource and capital investments are required to maintain compliance with these requirements.
 United States Hazardous Waste Regulation
 Our hazardous, industrial, non‑hazardous and radioactive waste treatment, disposal and handling business is subject to extensive federal and state environmental, health, safety, and transportation laws, regulations, permits and licenses. Local government controls may also apply. The responsible government regulatory agencies regularly inspect our operations to monitor compliance. They have authority to enforce compliance through the suspension or revocation of operating licenses and permits and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties in case of violations. We believe that these laws and regulations, as well as the specialized services we provide, contribute to demand and create barriers to new competitors seeking to enter the markets we serve.
 RCRA provides a comprehensive framework for regulating hazardous waste transportation, treatment, storage and disposal. RCRA regulation is the responsibility of the USEPA, which may delegate authority to state agencies. Chemical compounds and residues derived from USEPA‑listed industrial processes are subject to RCRA standards unless they are delisted through rulemaking. RCRA liability may be imposed for improper waste management or failure to take corrective action for releases of hazardous substances. To the extent wastes are recycled or beneficially reused, regulatory controls and permitting requirements under RCRA diminish. LARM and NORM/NARM may also be managed to varying degrees under RCRA permits, as is authorized for our facilities in Grand View, Idaho; Beatty, Nevada; Belleville, Michigan and Robstown, Texas.

 CWA legislation prohibits discharge of pollutants into the waters of the United States without governmental authorization and regulates the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and sewers from a variety of sources, including disposal sites and treatment facilities. The USEPA has promulgated “pretreatment” regulations under the CWA, which establish pretreatment standards for introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works. In the course of the treatment process, our wastewater treatment facilities generate wastewater, which we discharge to publicly owned treatment works pursuant to permits issued by the appropriate governmental authority. We are required to obtain discharge permits and conduct sampling and monitoring programs.
 CERCLA and its amendments impose strict, joint and several liability on owners or operators of facilities where a release of hazardous substances has occurred, on parties who generated hazardous substances released at such facilities and on parties who arranged for the transportation of hazardous substances. Liability under CERCLA may be imposed if releases of hazardous substances occur at treatment, storage or disposal sites. Since waste generators, transporters and those who arrange transportation are subject to the same liabilities, we believe they are motivated to minimize the number of disposal sites used. In addition, hazardous waste generated during the remediation of CERCLA cleanup projects and transferred offsite must be managed by a treatment and disposal facility authorized by EPA to manage CERCLA waste.
 TSCA regulates the treatment, storage and disposal of PCBs. U.S. regulation and licensing of PCB wastes is the responsibility of the USEPA. Our Grand View, Idaho and Beatty, Nevada facilities have TSCA treatment, storage and disposal permits. Our Belleville, Michigan facility has a TSCA disposal permit. Our Robstown, Texas facility has a TSCA storage permit and may dispose of PCB‑contaminated waste in limited concentrations not requiring a TSCA disposal permit.
 The AEA assigns the NRC regulatory authority over receipt, possession, use and transfer of certain radioactive materials, including disposal. The NRC has adopted regulations for licensing commercial LLRW disposal and has delegated regulatory authority to certain states including Washington, where our Richland facility is located. The NRC and U.S. Department of Transportation regulate the transport of radioactive materials. Shippers must comply with both the general requirements for hazardous materials transportation and specific requirements for transporting radioactive materials.
 The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the AEA to classify discrete (i.e. concentrated versus diffuse) NORM/NARM as byproduct material. The law does not apply to interstate Compacts ratified by Congress pursuant to the LLRW Policy Act.
 Canadian Hazardous Waste Regulation
 The Canadian federal government regulates issues of national scope where activities cross provincial boundaries and affect Canada’s relations with other nations. The Provinces retain control over environmental matters within their boundaries including primary responsibility for regulation and management of hazardous waste.
 The main federal laws governing hazardous waste management are CEPA and the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act. Environment and Climate Change Canada is the federal agency with responsibility for environmental matters. CEPA charges Environment Canada and Health Canada with the protection of human health and the environment and seeks to control the production, importation and use of substances in Canada and their impact on the environment. The Export and Import of Hazardous Waste Regulations under CEPA govern trans‑border movement of hazardous waste and hazardous recyclable materials. These regulations require that anyone proposing to export or import hazardous waste or hazardous recyclable materials or transport them through Canada notify the Minister of the Environment and obtain a permit to do so.
 Our Stablex facility is located in Blainville, Québec, Canada and is subject to QEQA. This Act, independently developed by the Province, regulates the generation, characterization, transport, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes. QEQA also provides for the establishment of waste management facilities which are controlled by the provincial statutes and regulations governing releases to air, groundwater and surface water.
 Our Tilbury, Ontario, Canada facility is subject to Regulation 347 of the Ontario Environmental Protection Act. Regulation 347, independently developed by the Province, regulates the collection, storage, transportation, treatment, recovery and disposal of hazardous wastes.

 Waste transporters require a permit to operate under the Province’s regulations and are also subject to the requirements of the Federal Transportation of Dangerous Goods law which requires reporting of quantities and disposition of materials shipped.
 A major difference between the United States regulatory regime and that in Canada relates to ownership and liability. Under Canadian federal regulation, ownership changes when waste is transferred to a properly permitted third‑party carrier and subsequently to an approved treatment and disposal facility. As a result, the generator is no longer liable for proper handling, treatment or disposal. In the United States, joint and several liability is retained by the waste generator as well as the transporter and the treatment and disposal facility.
 Insurance, Financial Assurance and Risk Management
 We carry a broad range of insurance coverage, including general liability, automobile liability, real and personal property, workers compensation, directors and officers liability, environmental impairment liability, business interruption and other coverage customary for a company of our size in our business. We purchase primary property, casualty and excess liability policies through traditional third‑party insurance carriers. We are self‑insured for employee health‑care coverage.
 Our domestic casualty insurance program provides coverage for commercial general liability, employer’s liability and automobile liability in the aggregate amount of $36.0 million each, per year, subject to a $100,000 retention per occurrence for our commercial general liability; a $350,000 deductible per occurrence for employer’s liability and a $100,000 deductible per occurrence for our automobile liability. Our workers compensation insurance limits are established by state statutes. Our Canadian casualty insurance program provides primary coverage for commercial general liability and automobile liability in the aggregate amount of $36.0 million each, per year, subject to a $50,000 retention for general liability and no retention for automobile liability.
 Our domestic property program provides coverage for real and personal property, business interruption and contractors’ equipment with a loss limit of $35.0 million, subject to a deductibles ranging from $500,000 to $1.0 million per occurrence for property and business interruption and $10,000 to $25,000 for contractors’ equipment. The program also includes flood, earthquake and wind coverage within the loss limit with a deductible ranging from $500,000 to $1.0 million subject to a percentage of value that ranges from 2% to 5%. We also maintain a separate boiler and machinery program with a loss limit of $100.0 million for property damage and business interruption subject to a $10,000 deductible or 24-hour waiting period specific to business interruption. For our California facility, we maintain an additional $10.0 million of coverage for earthquakes with a deductible ranging from $25,000 to $50,000 subject to a percentage of value that ranges from 3% to 5%. Our Canadian property program provides coverage for real and personal property, business interruption and contractors’ equipment with a loss limit of $70.0 million subject to a $50,000 deductible per occurrence. The program also includes flood and earth-movement coverage within the loss limits with deductibles of $50,000 for flood and 5% of the value for earth movement, subject to a $250,000 minimum per occurrence. We also maintain a separate Canadian boiler and machinery program with a loss limit of $74.0 million subject to a $25,000 deductible per occurrence and a 48-hour waiting period for business interruption.  
 On November 17, 2018, an explosion occurred at our Grand View, Idaho facility, resulting in one employee fatality and injuries to other employees. The incident severely damaged the facility’s primary waste-treatment building as well as surrounding waste handling, waste storage, maintenance and administrative support structures, resulting in the closure of the entire facility that remained in effect through January 2019. We resumed limited operations at our Grand View, Idaho facility in February 2019. We maintain workers’ compensation insurance, business interruption insurance and liability insurance for personal injury, property and casualty damage. We believe that any potential third-party claims associated with the explosion, in excess of our deductibles, are expected to be resolved primarily through our insurance policies. Although we carry business interruption insurance, a disruption of our business caused by a casualty event, including the full and partial closure of our Grand View, Idaho facility, may result in the loss of business, profits or customers during the time of such closure. As a result, our insurance policies may not fully compensate us for these losses.
     Federal, state and provincial regulations require financial assurance to cover the cost of final closure and post‑closure obligations at certain of our operating and non‑operating disposal facilities. Acceptable forms of financial assurance include third‑party standby letters of credit, surety bonds and insurance. Alternatively, we may be required to collect fees

from waste generators to fund dedicated, state‑controlled escrow or trust accounts during the operating life of the facility. Through December 31, 2018, we have met our financial assurance requirements through insurance, surety bonds, standby letters of credit and self‑funded restricted trusts. Insurance policies covering our U.S. closure and post‑closure obligations expire in April 2019 and December 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we have provided collateral of $4.9 million in funded trust agreements, $12.2 million in surety bonds, issued $2.7 million in letters of credit for financial assurance and have insurance policies of approximately $87.5 million for closure and post‑closure obligations. We maintain a surety bond for closure costs associated with the Blainville facility. Our lease agreement with the Province of Québec requires that the surety bond be maintained for 25 years after the lease expires. At December 31, 2018, we had $715,000 in commercial surety bonds dedicated for closure obligations.
 Primary casualty insurance programs generally do not cover accidental environmental contamination losses. Our domestic and Canadian pollution liability programs provide coverage for these types of losses in the aggregate amount of $50.0 million and $20.0 million per year, respectively, each subject to a $250,000 deductible per occurrence. We also carry domestic and Canadian professional environmental consultant’s liability insurance in the aggregate amount of $25.0 million and $5.0 million per year, respectively.  The domestic program is subject to a $100,000 retention per occurrence and the Canadian program is subject to a $25,000 deductible per occurrence. We also have a standalone RCRA site specific pollution liability policy in the aggregate amount of $35.0 million subject to a $250,000 deductible per occurrence.
 For nuclear liability coverage, we maintain Facility Form and Workers’ Form nuclear liability insurance provided under the federal Price Anderson Act. This insurance covers the operations of our facilities, suppliers and transporters. 
 Significant Customers
 No customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, or 2016.
 Seasonal Effects
 Seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles can influence the timing of customer spending for our services. Typically, in the first quarter of each calendar year there is less demand for our services due to reduced construction activities related to weather. While large, multi‑year cleanup projects may continue in winter months, the pace of waste shipments may be slower, or stop temporarily, due to weather. Market conditions and federal funding decisions generally have a greater influence on the business than seasonality. Personnel
 On December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,700 employees, of which approximately 200 in the United States and 100 in Canada were represented by various labor unions.
