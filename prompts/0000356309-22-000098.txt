Management uses NFE, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating its operating results. NFE is a measure of the earnings based on eliminating timing differences surrounding the recognition of certain gains or losses to effectively match the earnings effects of the economic hedges with the physical sale of natural gas and, therefore, eliminates the impact of volatility to GAAP earnings associated with the derivative instruments. Energy Services economically hedges its natural gas inventory with financial derivative instruments and calculates the related tax effect based on the statutory rate. NFE also excludes certain transactions associated with equity method investments, including impairment charges, which are non-cash charges, and return of capital in excess of the carrying value of our investment. These are considered unusual in nature and occur infrequently and are not indicative of the Company’s performance for its ongoing operations. Included in the tax effects are current and deferred income tax expense corresponding with the components of NFE.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure. The following is a reconciliation of consolidated net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NFE for the fiscal years ended September 30:

 Natural Gas Distribution
General
Natural Gas Distribution consists of regulated utility operations that provide natural gas service to approximately 569,300 customers. NJNG’s service territory includes Burlington, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean and Sussex counties in New Jersey. It encompasses 1,516 square miles, covering 108 municipalities with an estimated population of 1.5 million people. It is primarily suburban, highlighted by approximately 100 miles of New Jersey coastline. It is in close proximity to New York City, Philadelphia and the metropolitan areas of northern New Jersey, and is accessible through a network of major roadways and mass transportation.
NJNG’s business is subject to various risks, such as those associated with adverse economic conditions, which can negatively impact customer growth and operating and financing costs; fluctuations in commodity prices, which can impact customer usage; certain regulatory actions; and environmental remediation. It is often difficult to predict the impact of trends associated with these risks. NJNG employs strategies to pursue customer conversions from other fuel sources and monitor new construction markets through contact with developers, utilize incentive programs through BPU-approved mechanisms to reduce natural gas costs, pursue rate and other regulatory strategies designed to stabilize and decouple gross margin, and work actively with consultants and the NJDEP to manage expectations related to its obligations associated with its former MGP sites.
Operating Revenues/Throughput
For the fiscal years ended September 30, operating revenues and throughput by customer class for Natural Gas Distribution are as follows:

 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
($ in thousands) | Operating Revenue | Bcf | | Operating Revenue | Bcf | | Operating Revenue | Bcf 
Residential | $ | 598,433 | | 45.5 | | | $ | 484,407 | 46.2 | | $ | 500,271 | 44.6 
Commercial and other | 140,727 | | 8.7 | | | 103,341 | | 8.6 | | 98,463 | 8.2 | 
Firm transportation | 80,915 | | 13.0 | | | 69,353 | | 13.7 | | 66,871 | 13.3 | 
Total residential and commercial | 820,075 | | 67.2 | | | 657,101 | | 68.5 | | 665,605 | 66.1 | 
Interruptible/off-tariff agreements | 9,740 | | 32.4 | | | 7,239 | | 22.9 | | 6,322 | 30.9 | 
Total system | 829,815 | | 99.6 | | | 664,340 | | 91.4 | | 671,927 | 97.0 | 
BGSS incentive programs (1) | 298,952 | | 44.5 | | | 67,456 | | 20.8 | | 57,996 | 118.4 | 
Total | $ | 1,128,767 | | 144.1 | | | $ | 731,796 | 112.2 | | $ | 729,923 | 215.4

(1)Does not include 50.7, 80.5 and 86.3 Bcf for the capacity release program and related amounts of approximately $683,000, $3.1 million and $3.1 million, which are recorded as a reduction of natural gas purchases on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
NJNG added 7,808 and 7,854 new customers during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. NJNG expects its annual customer growth rate to be approximately 1.6 percent. This anticipated customer growth represents approximately $7.7 million in new annual Utility Gross Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, as calculated under NJNG’s current CIP tariff. For a reconciliation of Utility Gross Margin to gross margin see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Natural Gas Distribution.
In fiscal 2022, no single customer represented more than 10 percent of consolidated operating revenues.
Seasonality of Natural Gas Revenues
Therm sales are significantly affected by weather conditions, with customer demand being greatest during the winter months when natural gas is used for heating purposes. The relative measurement of the impact of weather is in Degree-days. Degree-day data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day’s average temperature. Each degree of temperature below 65 degrees Fahrenheit is counted as one heating Degree-day. Normal heating Degree-days are based on a 20-year average, calculated based on three reference areas representative of NJNG’s service territory.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                    

CIP, a mechanism authorized by the BPU, stabilizes NJNG’s Utility Gross Margin, regardless of variations in weather. In addition, CIP decouples the link between Utility Gross Margin and customer usage, allowing NJNG to promote energy conservation measures. Recovery of Utility Gross Margin is subject to additional conditions, including an earnings test, a revenue test and an evaluation of BGSS-related savings achieved over a 12-month period. The BPU approved the continuation of the CIP program with no expiration date.
Concurrent with its annual BGSS filing, NJNG files for an annual review of its CIP, at which time it can request rate changes, as appropriate. For additional information regarding CIP, including rate actions and impact to margin, see Note 4. Regulation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Natural Gas Distribution.
Natural Gas Supply
Firm Natural Gas Supplies
In fiscal 2022, NJNG purchased natural gas from approximately 59 suppliers under contracts ranging from one day to seven months and purchased over 10 percent of its natural gas from two suppliers. NJNG believes the loss of either of these suppliers would not have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as an adequate number of alternative suppliers exist. NJNG believes that its supply strategy should adequately meet its expected firm load for the upcoming winter season.
Firm Transportation and Storage Capacity
NJNG maintains agreements for firm transportation and storage capacity with several interstate pipeline companies to take delivery of firm natural gas supplies, which ensures the ability to reliably service its customers. NJNG receives natural gas at 11 citygate stations located in Burlington, Middlesex, Morris and Passaic counties in New Jersey.
The pipeline companies that provide firm transportation service to NJNG’s citygate stations, the maximum daily deliverability of that capacity and the contract expiration dates are as follows:

Pipeline | Dths (1) | Expiration
Texas Eastern Transmission, L.P. | 383,588 | | 2023-2025
Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. | 50,000 | | 2024-2030
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. | 25,166 | | 2024-2028
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. | 332,531 | | 2023-2033
Algonquin Gas Transmission | 12,000 | | 2024 
Total | 803,285 | | 

(1)    Numbers are shown net of any capacity release contracted amounts.
Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. and Adelphia Gateway provide NJNG upstream firm contract transportation service and supply pipelines included in the table above.
In addition, NJNG has storage contracts that provide an additional 102,941 Dths of maximum daily deliverability to NJNG’s citygate stations from storage fields in its Northeast market area. The storage suppliers, the maximum daily deliverability of that storage capacity and the contract expiration dates are as follows:

Pipeline | Dths | Expiration
Texas Eastern Transmission, L.P. | 94,557 | | 2024
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. | 8,384 | | 2028
Total | 102,941 | | 

NJNG also has upstream storage contracts. The maximum daily deliverability and contract expiration dates are as follows:

Company | Dths | Expiration
Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage | 286,829 | | 2023-2026
Steckman Ridge, L.P. | 38,000 | | 2025

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                    

NJNG utilizes its transportation contracts to transport natural gas to NJNG’s citygates from the Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc., Steckman Ridge and Stagecoach Pipeline & Storage Company LLC storage fields. NJNG has sufficient firm transportation, storage and supply capacity to fully meet its firm sales contract obligations.
 Citygate Supplies from Energy Services
NJNG has one AMA with Energy Services. NJNG and Energy Services have an agreement where NJNG releases 7,150 Dths/day of TETCO capacity, 2,200 Dths/day of Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. capacity, 10,728 Dths/day of Tennessee Gas Pipeline capacity and 1.6 million Dths of Stagecoach Pipeline & Storage Company LLC storage capacity to Energy Services through March 31, 2023. NJNG can call upon a supply of up to 14,300 Dths/day delivered to NJNG’s TETCO citygate through March 31, 2023. Energy Services manages the storage inventory and NJNG can call on that storage supply as needed at NJNG’s Tennessee citygate or storage point.
Peaking Supply
To manage its winter peak day demand, NJNG maintains two LNG facilities with a combined deliverability of approximately 170,000 Dths/day, which represents approximately 18 percent of its estimated peak day sendout. NJNG’s liquefaction facility allows NJNG to convert natural gas into LNG to fill NJNG’s existing LNG storage tanks. See Item 2. Properties-Natural Gas Distribution for additional information regarding the LNG storage facilities.
Basic Gas Supply Service
BGSS is a BPU-approved clause designed to allow for the recovery of natural gas commodity costs on an annual basis. The clause requires all New Jersey natural gas utilities to make an annual filing by each June 1 for review of BGSS rates and to request a potential rate change effective the following October 1. The BGSS also allows each natural gas utility to provisionally increase residential and small commercial customer BGSS rates on December 1 and February 1 for up to a five percent increase to the average residential heat customer’s bill on a self-implementing basis with proper notice. Such increases are subject to subsequent BPU review and final approval.
In addition to making periodic rate adjustments to reflect changes in commodity prices, NJNG is also permitted to refund or credit back a portion of the commodity costs to customers when the natural gas commodity costs decrease in comparison to amounts projected or to amounts previously collected from customers. Decreases in the BGSS rate and BGSS refunds can be implemented with five days’ notice to the BPU. Rate changes, as well as other regulatory actions related to BGSS, are discussed further in Note 4. Regulation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Wholesale natural gas prices are, by their nature, volatile. NJNG mitigates the impact of volatile price changes on customers through the use of financial derivative instruments, which are part of its storage incentive program and its BGSS clause.
Future Natural Gas Supplies
NJNG expects to meet the natural gas requirements for existing and projected firm customers. If NJNG’s long-term natural gas requirements change, NJNG expects to renegotiate and restructure its contract portfolio to better match the changing needs of its customers and changing natural gas supply landscape.
Regulation and Rates
State
NJNG is subject to the jurisdiction of the BPU with respect to a wide range of matters such as base rates and regulatory rider rates, the issuance of securities, the safety and adequacy of service, the manner of keeping its accounts and records, the sufficiency of natural gas supply, pipeline safety, environmental issues, compliance with affiliate standards and the sale or encumbrance of its properties. See Note 4. Regulation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding NJNG’s rate proceedings.
Federal
FERC regulates rates charged by interstate pipeline companies for the transportation and storage of natural gas. This affects NJNG’s agreements with several interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of such services. Costs associated with these services are currently recoverable through the BGSS.

Competition
Although its franchises are nonexclusive, NJNG is not currently subject to competition from other natural gas distribution utilities with regard to the transportation of natural gas in its service territory. Due to significant distances between NJNG’s current large industrial customers and the nearest interstate natural gas pipelines, as well as the availability of its transportation tariff, NJNG currently does not believe it has significant exposure to the risk that its distribution system will be bypassed. Competition does exist from suppliers of oil, electricity and propane. At the present time, however, natural gas is used in over 95 percent of new construction due to its efficiency, reliability and price advantage. Natural gas prices are a function of market supply and demand. Although NJNG believes natural gas will remain competitive with alternate fuels, no assurance can be given in this regard.
The BPU, within the framework of the EDECA, fully opened NJNG’s residential markets to competition, including third-party suppliers, and restructured rates to segregate its BGSS and delivery (i.e., transportation) prices. New Jersey’s natural gas utilities must provide BGSS in the absence of a third-party supplier. On September 30, 2022, NJNG had 17,316 residential and 8,397 commercial and industrial customers utilizing the transportation service.
Clean Energy Ventures
Clean Energy Ventures invests in, owns and operates clean energy projects, including commercial and residential solar installations located in New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York.
As of September 30, 2022, Clean Energy Ventures has approximately 386.6 MW of ITC-eligible solar capacity in service, including a combination of residential and commercial net-metered and grid-connected solar systems. 
As part of its solar investment portfolio, Clean Energy Ventures operates a residential and small commercial solar program, The Sunlight Advantage®, that provides qualifying homeowners and small business owners with the opportunity to have a solar system installed at their home or place of business with no installation or maintenance expenses. Clean Energy Ventures owns, operates and maintains the system over the life of the lease in exchange for monthly lease payments. The program is operated by Clean Energy Ventures using qualified contracting partners in addition to strategic suppliers for material standardization and sourcing. The residential solar lease and PPA market is highly competitive, with a large number of companies operating in New Jersey. Clean Energy Ventures competes on price, quality and brand reputation, leveraging its partner network and customer referrals.
Clean Energy Ventures’ commercial solar projects are sourced through various channels and include both net-metered and grid-connected systems. Net-metered projects involve the sale of energy to a host and grid-connected systems into the wholesale energy markets. Project construction is competitively sourced through third parties. New Jersey has the eighth largest solar market in the U.S., according to the Solar Energy Industries Association®, with a large number of firms competing in all facets of the market including development, financing and construction.
Our solar systems are registered and certified with the BPU’s Office of Clean Energy and qualified to produce RECs. One REC is created for every MWh of electricity produced by a solar generator. Clean Energy Ventures sells SRECs generated to a variety of counterparties, including electric load-serving entities that serve electric customers in New Jersey and are required to comply with the solar carve-out of the Renewable Portfolio Standard, a regulation that requires the increased production of energy from renewable energy sources. Solar projects are also currently eligible for federal ITCs in the year that they are placed into service. In December 2019, the BPU established the TREC as the interim program successor to the SREC program. TRECs provide a fixed compensation base multiplied by an assigned project factor in order to determine their value. The project factor is determined by the type and location of the project, as defined. All TRECs generated are required to be purchased monthly by a TREC program administrator as appointed by the BPU.
In July 2021, the BPU approved the first portion of the solar successor program for net-metered projects under 5 MWs. The new program opened to new applications on August 28, 2021. Incentives are structured as a 15-year fixed incentive ranging from $70 to $120/MWh depending on market segment, project siting and size. The second phase of the successor program is expected to include a competitive bid solicitation for projects greater than 5 MWs, with the solicitation program format and rules expected to be finalized in 2023.
Clean Energy Ventures is subject to various risks including those associated with adverse federal and state legislation and regulatory policies, electric grid connection, supply chain and/or construction delays that can impact the timing or eligibility of tax incentives, technological changes and the future market of RECs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding these risks.

Energy Services
Energy Services consists of unregulated wholesale and retail natural gas operations and provides producer and asset management services to a diverse customer base across North America. Energy Services has acquired contractual rights to natural gas transportation and storage assets it utilizes to implement its strategic and opportunistic market strategies. The rights to these assets were acquired in anticipation of delivering natural gas, performing asset management services for customers or identifying strategic opportunities that exist in or between the market areas that it serves. These opportunities are driven by price differentials between market locations and/or time periods. Energy Services’ activities are conducted in the market areas in which it has strong expertise, including the U.S. and Canada. Energy Services differentiates itself in the marketplace based on price, reliability and quality of service. Its competitors include wholesale marketing and trading companies, utilities, natural gas producers and financial institutions. Energy Services’ portfolio of customers includes regulated natural gas distribution companies, industrial companies, electric generators, natural gas/liquids processors, retail aggregators, wholesale marketers and natural gas producers.
While focusing on maintaining a low-risk operating and counterparty credit profile, Energy Services’ activities specifically consist of the following elements:
•Providing natural gas portfolio management services to nonaffiliated and our affiliated natural gas utility, electric generation facilities and natural gas producers;
•Managing strategies for new and existing natural gas transportation and storage assets to capture value from changes in price due to location or timing differences as a means to generate Financial Margin;
•Managing transactional logistics to minimize the cost of natural gas delivery to customers while maintaining security of supply. Transactions utilize the most optimal and advantageous natural gas supply transportation routing available within its contractual asset portfolio and various market areas; and
•Managing economic hedging programs that are designed to mitigate the impact of changes in market prices on Financial Margin generated on its natural gas transportation and storage commitments.
In an effort to deliver more predictable earnings contributions, reduce earnings volatility and monetize the value of its natural gas transportation portfolio, Energy Services entered into a series of AMAs in December 2020 with an investment grade public utility to release pipeline capacity associated with certain natural gas transportation contracts. The AMAs include a series of initial and permanent releases, which commenced on November 1, 2021. NJR will receive a total of approximately $260 million in cash from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024 and $34 million per year from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2031 under the agreements.
During fiscal 2022, Energy Services did not purchase over 10 percent of its natural gas from any one supplier.
Transportation and Natural Gas Storage Transactions

Energy Services focuses on creating value from the use of its physical assets, which are typically amassed through contractual rights to natural gas transportation and storage capacity. These assets become more valuable when favorable price changes occur that impact the value between or within market areas and across time periods. On a forward basis, Energy Services may hedge these price differentials through the use of financial instruments. In addition, Energy Services may seek to optimize these assets on a daily basis, as market conditions warrant, by evaluating natural gas supply and transportation availability within its portfolio. This enables Energy Services to capture geographic pricing differences across various regions, as delivered natural gas prices may change favorably as a result of market conditions. Energy Services may, for example, initiate positions when intrinsic Financial Margin is present, and then enhance that Financial Margin as prices change across regions or time periods.

Energy Services also engages in park and loan transactions with storage and pipeline operators, where Energy Services will either borrow (receive a loan of) natural gas with an obligation to repay the storage or pipeline operator at a later date or “park” natural gas with an obligation to withdraw at a later date. In these cases, Energy Services evaluates the economics of the transaction to determine if it can capture pricing differentials in the marketplace and generate Financial Margin. Energy Services evaluates deal attributes such as fixed fees, calendar-spread value from deal inception until volumes are scheduled to be returned and/or repaid, as well as the time value of money. If this evaluation demonstrates that Financial Margin exists, Energy Services may enter into the transaction and hedge with natural gas futures contracts, thereby locking in Financial Margin.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                    

Energy Services maintains inventory balances to satisfy existing or anticipated sales of natural gas to its counterparties and/or to create additional value, as described above. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, Energy Services managed and sold 231.1 Bcf and 382.0 Bcf of natural gas, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, Energy Services had 10.8 Bcf or $82.5 million of natural gas in storage and 18.8 Bcf or $77.8 million of natural gas in storage, respectively.

Weather/Seasonality

Energy Services activities are typically seasonal in nature as a result of changes in the supply and demand for natural gas. Demand for natural gas is generally higher during the winter months when there may also be supply constraints; however, during periods of milder temperatures, demand can decrease. In addition, demand for natural gas can also be high during periods of extreme heat in the summer months, resulting from the need for additional natural gas supply for natural gas-fired electric generation facilities. Accordingly, Energy Services can be subject to variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather.

Volatility

Energy Services’ activities are also subject to price volatility or supply/demand dynamics within its North American wholesale markets, including in the Northeastern, Appalachian, Mid-Continent and Southeast regions. Changes in natural gas supply can affect capacity values and Energy Services’ Financial Margin, which, as described below, is generated from the optimization of transportation and storage assets. With its focus on risk management, Energy Services continues to diversify its revenue stream by identifying new growth opportunities in producer and asset management services. Energy Services monitors changing market dynamics and strategically adjusts its portfolio of transportation and storage assets, which currently includes an average of approximately 25.4 Bcf of firm storage and 0.7 Bcf of firm transportation capacity.
Financial Margin
To economically hedge the commodity price risk associated with its existing and anticipated commitments for the purchase and sale of natural gas, Energy Services enters into a variety of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, futures contracts, physical forward contracts, financial swaps and options. These derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as they occur. Energy Services views Financial Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a key internal financial metric. For additional information regarding Financial Margin, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Energy Services.
Risk Management
In conducting its business, Energy Services mitigates risk by following formal risk management guidelines, including transaction limits, segregation of duties and formal contract and credit review approval processes. Energy Services continuously monitors and seeks to reduce the risk associated with its counterparty credit exposures. Our Risk Management Committee oversees compliance with these established guidelines.
Storage and Transportation 
Storage and Transportation includes investments in FERC-regulated interstate natural gas storage and transportation assets and is comprised of the following subsidiaries:
•NJR Midstream Company owns and operates Leaf River, a 32.2 million Dth salt dome natural gas facility, located in southeastern Mississippi, and the FERC-regulated Adelphia Gateway, which owns and operates an 84-mile pipeline in southeastern Pennsylvania. NJR Midstream Company also holds a 20 percent equity method investment in PennEast, whose project was cancelled in September 2021 and subsequently is dissolving the partnership; and
•NJR Steckman Ridge Storage Company holds our 50 percent equity method investment in Steckman Ridge. Steckman Ridge is a Delaware limited partnership, jointly owned and controlled by our subsidiaries and subsidiaries of Enbridge Inc., which built, owns and operates a natural gas storage facility with up to 12 Bcf of working natural gas capacity in Bedford County, Pennsylvania. The facility has direct access to the TETCO and Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. pipelines and has access to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic markets.

OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS
Home Services and Other
Home Services and Other operations consist primarily of the following unregulated affiliates:
•NJRHS, which provides heating, ventilation and cooling service, sales and installation of appliances to approximately 103,100 service contract customers, as well as installation of solar equipment;
•NJR Plumbing Services, Inc., which provides plumbing repair and installation services;
•NJR Retail Company, which provides home warranty contracts:
•New Jersey Resources Corporation, a diversified energy services holding company;
•CR&R, which holds commercial real estate; and
•NJR Service Corporation, which provides shared administrative and financial services to the Company and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates.

ENVIRONMENT
We, along with our subsidiaries, are subject to legislation and regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to environmental matters. We believe that we are, in all material respects, in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.

NJNG is responsible for the environmental remediation of identified former MGP sites, which contain contaminated residues from former gas manufacturing operations that ceased at these sites by the mid-1950s and, in some cases, had been discontinued many years earlier. NJNG periodically, and at least annually, performs an environmental review of the former MGP sites, including a review of potential estimated liabilities related to the investigation and remedial action on these sites. Based on this review, NJNG has estimated that the total future expenditures to remediate and monitor the former MGP sites for which it is responsible will range from approximately $110.8 million to $167.1 million.
NJNG’s estimate of these liabilities is based upon known and measurable facts, existing technology and enacted laws and regulations in place when the review was completed in fiscal 2022. Where it is probable that costs will be incurred, and the information is sufficient to establish a range of possible liability, NJNG accrues the most likely amount in the range. If no point within the range is more likely than the other, it is NJNG’s policy to accrue the lower end of the range. As of September 30, 2022, NJNG recorded an MGP remediation liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of $127.1 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on the most likely amount; however, actual costs may differ from these estimates. 
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
Employee Overview
NJR fundamentally believes that its employees make the Company a unique, successful organization – in creativity, commitment, ingenuity, hard work and innovation. NJR employees fulfill the responsibilities that enable the Company to deliver natural gas service to its customers; to be a leader in clean energy investments; to grow its storage and transportation energy business; and to earn the loyalty of its retail home services customers. NJR also is committed to provide every appropriate resource to ensure its employees’ safety. Through initiatives that start at the top, NJR has invested time, energy and manpower to foster a culture where safety is top-of-mind at all times, and where achieving safety goals is a shared priority for every NJR employee.
As of September 30, 2022, the Company and our subsidiaries employed 1,288 employees compared with 1,251 employees as of September 30, 2021. Of the total number of employees, NJNG had 498 and 492 and NJRHS had 113 and 108 Union or Represented employees as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. NJNG and NJRHS have collective bargaining agreements with the Union, which is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. NJNG and the Union negotiated an extension of their current collective bargaining agreement extending the term through December 7, 2023. The collective bargaining agreement between NJRHS and the Union is scheduled to expire April 2, 2024. The labor agreements cover wage increases and other benefits, including the defined benefit pension (which was closed to all employees hired on or after January 1, 2012, with the exception of certain rehires who are eligible to resume active participation), the postemployment benefit plan (which was closed to all employees hired on or after January 1, 2012) and the enhanced 401(k) retirement savings plan. We consider our relationship with employees, including those covered by collective bargaining agreements, to be in good standing.

The Company depends on its key personnel to successfully operate its businesses, including its executive officers, senior corporate management and management at its operating units. NJR seeks to attract and retain its employees by offering competitive compensation packages including base and incentive compensation (and in certain instances share-based compensation and retention incentives), attractive benefits and opportunities for advancement and rewarding careers. NJR periodically reviews and adjusts, if needed, its employees’ total compensation (including salaries, annual cash incentive compensation, other cash and equity incentives and benefits) to ensure that it is competitive within the industry and is consistent with our level of performance. NJR has also implemented enterprise-wide talent development and succession planning programs designed to identify future and/or replacement candidates for key positions. To promote a collaborative and rewarding work environment and support the communities we serve, NJR sponsors numerous charitable, philanthropic and social awareness programs.
Further, in order to take advantage of available opportunities and successfully implement our long-term strategy, NJR must be able to employ, train and retain the necessary skilled personnel. As a result, NJR supports and utilizes various training and educational programs and has developed additional company-wide and project-specific employee training and educational programs. NJR continues key programs focused on employee safety, leadership development, work-life balance, talent management, health and wellness, DEI and employee engagement. Moreover, DEI and employee engagement are integral to NJR’s vision, strategy and business success. NJR prides itself on a culture that respects co-workers and values concern for others. Fostering an environment that values DEI and ethics helps create an organization that is able to embrace, leverage and respect the differences of employees, customers and the communities where we live, work and serve. We are proud of the strides we have made in furthering our DEI strategy and increasing employee engagement. NJR is committed to this journey and knows our success makes us stronger as a company and community. Complementing our efforts are a DEI Council and our six employee-led Business Resource Groups, cross functional teams of employees whose core mission is to advance their own professional development and cultivate deeper connections with co-workers and communities.
NJR periodically evaluates employees and their productivity against future demand expectations and historical trends. NJR employees continue to maintain high levels of engagement, satisfaction and retention according to NJR’s most recent employee survey.
NJR’s Board of Directors’ Role in Human Capital Resource Management
NJR’s Board of Directors believes that human capital management is an important component of the Company’s continued growth and success, and is essential for our ability to attract, retain and develop talented and skilled employees. We pride ourselves on a culture that promotes DEI, respects co-workers and values concern for others.
Management regularly reports to the LDCC of the Board of Directors on human capital management topics, including corporate culture, DEI, employee development, compensation and benefits. The LDCC maintains oversight of matters related to human capital management, including talent retention, development and succession planning, and the Board of Directors provides input on important decisions in each of these areas.
NJR regularly conducts an employee feedback survey, which is reviewed by the LDCC, designed to help the Company measure overall employee engagement. The feedback employees provide during the survey helps NJR evaluate the Company’s culture, employee programs and benefits and monitor its current practices for potential areas of improvement.
Employee Benefits
The LDCC believes employee benefits are an essential component of the Company’s competitive total rewards package. These benefits are designed to attract and retain our employees and include medical, vision and dental insurance, short- and long-term disability insurance, accidental death and disability insurance, travel and accident insurance and our 401(k) Plan. As part of the 401(k) Plan, NJR matches 85 percent of the first 6 percent of compensation contributed by the employee into the 401(k) Plan, subject to the Internal Revenue Code and NJR’s 401(k) Plan limits. Additionally, for employees who are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plans, NJR contributes between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent of base compensation, depending upon years of service, into the 401(k) Plan on their behalf.
