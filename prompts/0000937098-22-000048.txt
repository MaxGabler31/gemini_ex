Item 1. Business 
TriNet is a leading provider of HR expertise, payroll services, employee benefits and employment risk mitigation services for SMBs. Since our founding in 1988, TriNet has served, and continues to serve, thousands of SMBs. In 2021, we processed $55 billion in payroll and payroll taxes for our clients and ended the year with approximately 16,300 clients and 364,900 WSEs, primarily in the U.S.
Our Services
We deliver a comprehensive suite of services that help our clients administer and manage various HR-related needs and functions, such as compensation and benefits, payroll processing, employee data, health insurance and workers' compensation programs, and transactional HR needs using our technology platform and HR, benefits and compliance expertise. We empower SMBs to focus on what matters most - growing their business.
We leverage our scale and industry HR experience to deliver our service offerings tailored for SMBs in specific industry verticals. We believe our vertical approach is a key differentiator for us and creates additional value for our clients by addressing their industry-specific HR needs. We offer six industry-tailored vertical services: TriNet Financial Services, TriNet Life Sciences, TriNet Main Street, TriNet Nonprofit, TriNet Professional Services, and TriNet Technology. 
Our comprehensive HR solutions include the following capabilities:

HR CONSULTING EXPERTISE | BENEFITOPTIONS | PAYROLL SERVICES | RISK MITIGATION | TECHNOLOGYPLATFORM

 HR Consulting Expertise
We use the collective knowledge and experience of our teams of HR, benefits, risk management and compliance professionals to help clients manage many of the administrative, regulatory and practical requirements associated with being employers. We do this by incorporating our knowledge and experience into our services and our technology platform and by making our professionals available to consult with clients on a variety of HR needs, including talent management, retention and terminations, benefits enrollment, immigration and visas, payroll tax credits, employment law and regulatory developments and many other industry-specific and general HR topics. Depending on their needs, our clients and WSEs have access to varying levels of service and support from our professionals, ranging from call center support for basic questions to pooled HR resources. Our professionals also provide additional specialized HR consulting and services upon request.
 Benefit Options
We utilize our scale to provide our WSEs access to a broad range of TriNet-sponsored employee benefit and insurance programs at costs that we believe most of our clients would be unable to obtain on their own. We believe that our TriNet-sponsored programs help clients compete for talent against larger businesses. Our benefit and insurance programs are designed to comply with federal, state and local regulations, and our benefit and insurance service offerings include plan selection and administration, enrollment management, leave management, plan document distribution and WSE and client communications. 
Under our benefit and insurance programs, we pay third-party insurance carriers for WSE insurance benefits and reimburse insurance carriers or third-party administrators for claims payments within our insurance deductible layer, where applicable. 

TRINET | 2021 FORM 10-K


BUSINESS

We sponsor and administer several employee benefit plans for our WSEs through a broad range of carriers, including group health, dental, vision, short- and long-term disability, and life insurance as an employer plan sponsor under Section 3(5) of ERISA. We also provide for other benefit programs to be made available to WSEs, including flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, retirement benefits, COBRA benefits, supplemental insurance, commuter benefits, home insurance, critical illness insurance, accident insurance, hospital indemnity, pet insurance, and auto insurance. For further discussion of our insurance programs, including policies where we reimburse our carriers for certain amounts relating to claims, refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.
 Payroll Services
We help clients manage their employee compensation by providing multi-state payroll processing, tax administration services and other payroll-related services, such as time and attendance management, time off and overtime tracking, and expense management solutions. Our clients and WSEs can access payroll and tax information using our online and mobile tools. Our tax administration services include calculating, withholding, remitting and reporting certain federal, state and local payroll and unemployment taxes on behalf of clients and WSEs.
 Risk Mitigation 
We monitor employment-related legal and regulatory developments at the federal, state, and local levels to help our clients comply with employment laws and mitigate many of the risks associated with being an employer. We provide HR guidance on employment laws and regulations, including those relating to minimum wage, unemployment insurance, family and medical leave and anti-discrimination. We also ensure that our TriNet-sponsored benefit plans comply with applicable laws and regulations, like the ACA, reducing this compliance burden to our clients. 
We provide fully-insured workers' compensation insurance coverage for our clients and WSEs through insurance policies that we negotiate with our third-party insurance carriers. We manage the deductible risk that we assume in connection with these policies by being selective in the types of businesses that we take on as new clients, and by monitoring claims data and the performance of our carriers and third-party claims management service providers. In addition, we advise clients on workers’ compensation best practices, including by performing workplace assessment consultations and assisting with client efforts to identify conditions or practices that might lead to employee injuries. 
We also provide EPLI coverage for our clients through an insurance policy that we obtain from a third-party EPLI carrier. This policy provides coverage for certain claims that arise in the course of the employment relationship, such as discrimination, harassment, and certain other employee claims, with a per-claim retention amount. The retention amount under this policy, which functions like a deductible, is allocated on a pre-determined basis between the client and TriNet. Our professionals assist our clients in implementing HR best practices to help avoid and reduce the cost of employment-related liabilities. Our preferred outside employment law firms defend covered EPLI claims.
  Technology Platform 
Our technology platform includes online and mobile tools that allow our clients and WSEs to store, view, and manage HR information and administer a variety of HR transactions, such as payroll processing, tax administration, employee onboarding and termination, compensation reporting, expense management, and benefits enrollment and administration. Our online tools also incorporate workforce analytics, allowing clients to generate HR data, payroll, total compensation and other custom reports. We invest time and resources in an effort to improve and expand our technology platform and the products and services that we offer. For example, in 2020, we adopted a new client service engagement support model, called Connect 360, that we believe will benefit our clients and WSEs by providing them with improved support services. Similarly, in 2021, we launched Financial Services Preferred, and a new product, called IOM, that offers clients the option to receive PEO services from TriNet while also obtaining client-sponsored health benefits from a third-party broker that partners with TriNet.

BUSINESS

Our Co-Employment Model
We operate using a co-employment model, under which employment-related responsibilities are allocated by contract between us and our clients. This model allows WSEs to receive the full benefit of our services, including access to TriNet-sponsored employee benefit plan offerings. Each of our clients enters into a client service agreement with us that defines the suite of services and benefits to be provided by us, the fees payable to us, and the division of responsibilities between us and our clients as co-employers. WSEs also separately acknowledge the co-employment relationship and the allocation of employment-related responsibilities between TriNet and our clients. The division of responsibilities under our client service agreements is typically as follows:
TriNet Responsibilities 
We generally assume responsibility for, and manage certain risks associated with:
•payments of salaries, wages and certain other compensation to WSEs from our own bank accounts (based on client reports and payments), including the processing of garnishment and wage deduction orders,
•reporting of wages, withholding and deposit of associated payroll taxes as the employer of record,
•provision and maintenance of workers' compensation insurance and workers' compensation claims processing,
•access to, and administration of, group health, welfare, and retirement benefits to WSEs under TriNet-sponsored benefit plans,
•compliance with applicable law for certain TriNet-sponsored employee benefits offered to WSEs,
•administration of unemployment claims, and
•provision of various HR policies and agreements, including employee handbooks and worksite employee agreements describing the co-employment relationship.
Client Responsibilities 
Our clients are responsible for employment-related responsibilities that we do not specifically assume, generally including: 
•day-to-day management of their worksites and WSEs,
•compliance with laws associated with the classification of employees as exempt or non-exempt, such as overtime pay and minimum wage law compliance,
•accurate and timely reporting to TriNet of compensation and deduction information, including information relating to hours worked, rates of pay, salaries, wages and other compensation, and work locations,
•accurate and timely reporting to TriNet of information relating to workplace injuries, employee hires and termination, and certain other information relevant to TriNet’s services,
•provision and administration of any employee benefits not provided by TriNet such as equity incentive plans,
•compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to the clients' workplace and business, including work eligibility laws, laws relating to workplace safety or the environment, laws relating to family and medical leave, laws pertaining to employee organizing efforts and collective bargaining and employee termination notice requirements,
•payment of TriNet invoices, which include salary, wages and other relevant compensation to WSEs and applicable employment taxes and service fees, and
•all other matters for which TriNet does not assume responsibility under the client service agreement, such as intellectual property ownership and protection and liability for products produced and services provided by the client company to its own clients. 
As a result of our co-employment relationships, we are liable for payment of salary, wages and certain other compensation to the WSEs as reported and paid to us by the client, and are responsible for providing specified employee benefits to such persons to the extent provided in each client service agreement and under federal and state law. In most instances, clients are required to remit payment prior to the applicable payroll date by wire transfer or ACH.

TRINET | 2021 FORM 10-K


BUSINESS

We also assume responsibility for payment and liability for the withholding and remittance of federal and state income and employment taxes with respect to salaries, wages and certain other compensation paid to WSEs, although we reserve the right to seek recourse against our clients for any liabilities arising out of their conduct. We perform these functions as the statutory employer for federal employment tax purposes, since our clients transfer legal control over these payroll functions to us. The laws that govern the payment of salaries, wages and related payroll taxes for our WSEs are complex and the various federal, state and local laws that govern such payments can vary significantly. Based on applicable law in any jurisdiction, we or our client may be held ultimately liable for those obligations if we fail to remit taxes. 
Market Trends and Developments Affecting Our Business in 2021
Despite the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. economy saw substantial recovery in 2021 due to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, consumer demand and continued federal and state legislative efforts to help businesses and employees. We observed the following PEO industry trends in 2021:
•SMB Economic Recovery. The U.S. economy saw substantial recovery from the pandemic driven economic downturn in 2020, however the extent of the recovery for SMBs differed based on their industry and geographic region. For example, SMBs in the financial services, technology and professional services industries generally experienced shallower headcount declines in 2020 and have recovered headcount more quickly in 2020 and 2021 as their workforces were better able to transition to remote work. Meanwhile, SMBs in the retail, leisure and hospitality industries generally experienced significant headcount freezes, furloughs and terminations in 2020, and these headcount declines have been slow to recover in 2020 and 2021. Similarly, SMBs in geographic regions that saw significant increases in COVID-19 cases in 2021 from the Delta and Omicron variants have generally experienced more significant economic headwinds.
•Continued Insurance Cost Variability and Volatility. The volume of medical claims, including COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccination costs, increased in 2021, however medical claim volume remained below pre-pandemic levels. Access to medical services and systems remained constrained in 2021, particularly in regions that saw increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations that reduced preventative and elective procedures. 
•Laws and Regulations. Numerous laws and regulations were created or modified in 2021 that had an impact on our business and the businesses of our clients and SMBs across the country. For example, the PPPFA and ARPA, were passed in 2021 to augment and extend 2020 programs intended to assist SMB’s and their employees to recover from the impacts of COVID-19. The paid leave and corresponding employer tax credit under the FFCRA was modified and extended through the third quarter of 2021, and the employee retention credit program under the CARES Act was also extended and modified before being retroactively terminated effective at end of the third quarter of 2021. Additional provisions of the CCPA became effective in 2021, and the DOL issued regulatory guidance regarding cybersecurity measures applicable to retirement plans. Federal and state views on employees and independent contractors remained in flux during 2021 as we saw a California state court find that Proposition 22, which was a modification of an earlier law that reclassified certain independent contractors as employees, was unconstitutional and unenforceable. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) also announced plans to create a new rule for determining whether two business are joint employers or co-employers and is expected to announce this new rule in 2022. We do not believe we are a joint employer, but changes in regulations determining joint employer status could lead to increased legal claims against us or our clients, increase our compliance costs, or require changes to how we operate our business and the services we provide to our clients and WSEs. 
For more information regarding the developments above, including the impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations, refer to Part II, Item 7. MD&A in this Form 10-K, and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors under the subheading "Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic".
Our Service Development Efforts
We continued to make significant investments in our technology platform with projects intended to provide our users with improved functionality, HR management options, and security. We intend to continue to invest in our technology platform to improve its functionality, ease of use, security and the overall user experience for our clients and WSEs. We believe the continued investment in improving our technology platform will drive operating efficiencies over the long term and improve our client experience. 
In 2021, we distributed $86 million to customers under our 2020 Recovery Credit program under which eligible clients received one-time reductions against fees for services. Our Recovery Credit program is designed to promote 

TRINET | 2021 FORM 10-K


BUSINESS

client loyalty, incentivize client retention, and to differentiate TriNet from its peers in the PEO industry and in other competing HR services industries. Similarly, in March 2021, we created our 2021 Credit program, which was designed to return $25 million to eligible customers based on the performance of our health insurance costs for the year. 
Throughout 2021 we continued to modify the programs we created in 2020 to support several important funding and payroll tax incentive programs for SMBs created under the FFCRA, CARES Act and PPFA, including PPP, mandatory employee leave requirements, payroll tax deferral and tax credit programs and other employment- and employment tax-related incentives. Changes to these programs in 2021, including guidance from the state and federal agencies managing these programs, required us to create new services, or redesign our existing services, to support these programs for our SMB clients and we expect to continue to make changes to these programs as laws and regulatory guidance change over time.
To engage with our clients and SMBs, we hosted the 2nd annual TriNet PeopleForce conference in the third quarter of 2021, our showcase customer and prospect conference focused on business transformation, agility and innovation for SMBs.
In December 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Zenefits, a leading cloud HR platform which provides innovative and intuitive HR, benefits, payroll and employee engagement software purpose-built for SMBs. We believe the acquisition of Zenefits, once completed, will allow us to diversify our product offering to include an Administrative Services Organization (ASO), enabling us to dynamically service SMBs throughout their lifecycle and expand the customers we serve.
Our Clients and Geographies
Our clients are distributed across a variety of industries, including technology, professional services, financial services, life sciences, not-for-profit, property management, retail, manufacturing, and hospitality. We generally support these different clients using our industry-tailored vertical approach. Our clients generally execute annual service contracts with us that automatically renew. In most cases, our clients may cancel these contracts with 30 days' notice to us and we may cancel these contracts with 30 days' notice.
Nearly all of our revenues are generated within the United States and its territories and substantially all our long-lived assets are located in the United States.
Our Competitors
We face competition from:
•PEOs that compete directly with us,
•HR and information systems departments and personnel of companies that administer employee benefits, payroll and HR for their companies in-house,
•providers of certain endpoint HR services, including payroll, employee benefits, business process outsourcers with high-volume transaction and administrative capabilities, and other third-party administrators, and
•insurance brokers who allow third-party HR systems to integrate with their technology platform.
Our competitors include large PEOs such as the TotalSource unit of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., the PEO operations of Paychex, Inc. and Insperity, Inc., as well as numerous specialized and smaller PEOs and similar HR service providers with PEO operations. 
We believe that our services are attractive to many SMBs in part because of our ability to provide access to a broad range of TriNet-sponsored workers compensation, health insurance and other benefits programs on a cost-effective basis. We compete with insurance brokers and other providers of insurance and benefits coverage, and our offerings must be priced competitively with those provided by these competitors in order for us to attract and retain our clients.
We believe that we also compete based upon the breadth and depth of our benefit plans, vertical market expertise, total cost of service, brand awareness and reputation, ability to innovate and respond to client needs rapidly, access to online and mobile solutions, and subject matter expertise. We believe that we are competitive across these factors. For additional information about our competition, please refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form

Our Sales and Marketing Organizations
We sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales organization. We have aligned our sales organization by industry vertical with the goal of growing profitable market share in our targeted industries. This vertical approach deepens our network of relationships and gives us an understanding of the unique HR needs facing SMBs in those industries. Our sales representatives are supported by marketing, lead generation efforts, and referral sources and networks. While the COVID-19 pandemic made it difficult to engage with prospects face-to-face, the use of technology and communication tools created new opportunities for us to engage with customers and prospects virtually.
We typically sponsor and participate in associations and events around the country and utilize these forums to target specific vertical and geographic markets. We responded to the unique challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic by shifting between virtual and in-person events. Events include our 2nd Annual TriNet PeopleForce conference, and informational webinars periodically throughout the year on a wide variety of COVID-19 and business topics relevant to our SMB prospects and clients. We also generate sales opportunities within key industry verticals, through marketing alliances and other indirect channels, such as accounting firms, venture capital firms, incubators, insurance brokers, and vertical market industry associations. Additionally, we utilize digital marketing programs, including digital advertising, search and email marketing, to create awareness and interest in our services. 
Our marketing and corporate communications organization is charged with driving overall brand awareness, managing lead generation, creating and managing our website and other online properties, creating content for all marketing and communication channels including our outbound and inbound marketing efforts, media relations, and managing our sponsorships, major marketing events, and internal and external communications. Prospects changed the way they engaged with us during COVID-19 by using more digital tools like tele-presence and web engagements. In 2021, we launched numerous digital channels for engagement, including conversational marketing enhancements on our website in response to customers' changing preferences. In 2021, our marketing team also focused on strategic marketing, communications social media, branding initiatives, and crisis communication plans, in part by augmenting our comprehensive company brand campaign, Incredible Starts Here, with our marketing campaign, People Matter, that included omni channel initiatives using social media, digital, television, radio and out-of-home media.
The Laws and Regulations that Affect Our Business
Our business operates in a complex legal and regulatory environment due to a myriad of federal, state and local laws and regulations that impact our business. Below is a summary of what we believe are the most important legal and regulatory issues for our business. For additional information on the impact of these and other laws and regulations on our business and results of operations, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K, under the heading - "Legal and Compliance Risks". 
Employer Status
We sponsor our employee benefit plan offerings as the employer of our WSEs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), ERISA and applicable state law. The term “employer” has different definitions for different purposes under the Code and ERISA, and for most purposes are interpreted under complex multi-factor tests under common law. We believe that we are an “employer” of our WSEs in the U.S. under the Code and the employer of our WSEs in the U.S. for the purposes of ERISA, as well as qualifying as an employer under various state laws, but this status could be subject to challenge by various regulators. For additional information on our employer status and its impact on our business and results of operations, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K, under the heading - "If we are not recognized as an employer of worksite employees under federal and state regulations, we and our clients could be adversely impacted".

TRINET | 2021 FORM 10-K


BUSINESS

Health Insurance and Health Care Reform
Our sponsored employee health and welfare offerings are an important component of the services that we provide. The future of health care reform continues to evolve in the U.S. For example, the passage of the ACA in 2010 implemented sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2022, and many provisions in the ACA are still subject to the issuance of additional guidance from the DOL, the IRS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and various U.S. states. Passage of the TCJA in 2017 eliminated the individual mandate tax penalty under the ACA beginning in 2019, while retaining employer ACA mandate obligations. States have developed, and will continue to develop, varying approaches to state-based health exchanges and mandates. Further significant changes to health care statutes, regulations and policy at the federal, state and local levels could occur in 2022 and beyond, including the potential further modification or amendment of the ACA, and we may need to adapt the manner in which we conduct our business as a result of any such changes. For additional information on the ACA and its impact on our business and results of operations, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K, under the heading - "Changing laws and regulations governing health insurance and other traditional employee benefits at the federal, state and local level could negatively affect our business".
Data Privacy and Security Regulations
We collect, store, use, retain, disclose, transfer and otherwise process a significant amount of confidential, sensitive and personal information from and about our actual and potential clients, WSEs and corporate employees, and we are subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws, rules, and regulations in connection with such activities. As a sponsor of employee benefit plans, we also have access to certain protected health information (PHI) of our WSEs and corporate employees. Management of PHI is subject to several regulations at the federal level, including HIPAA and the HITECH Act. HIPAA contains restrictions and health data privacy, security and breach notification requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of PHI. Further, there are penalties and fines for HIPAA violations. Because TriNet sponsored health plans are covered entities under HIPAA, we are required to comply with HIPAA's portability, privacy, and security requirements. We are also subject, among other applicable federal laws, rules and regulations, to the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission. The U.S. Congress has considered, but not yet passed, several comprehensive federal data privacy bills over the past few years. Additionally, several federal agencies have issued rules, regulations or other forms of guidance that may impact the privacy and security obligations that apply to our operations. We expect that the federal government’s approach to data privacy and security will continue to evolve in the coming years. 
At the state and local level, there is increased focus on regulating the collection, storage, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of confidential, sensitive and personal information. In recent years, we have seen significant changes to data privacy regulations across the U.S., including the enactment of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, including an obligation to provide certain new disclosures to such residents. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. The CCPA was amended in September 2018 and October 2019, and further amendments may be enacted. In November 2020, California approved the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which creates a new privacy oversight agency and further amends the CCPA to provide additional rights to consumers to access, edit and control the sale and sharing of personal information. The provisions of the CPRA go into effect in January 2023. 

TRINET | 2021 FORM 10-K


BUSINESS

In 2021, two additional states—Virginia and Colorado—enacted comprehensive data privacy laws that will go into effect in 2023, while legislatures in several additional states considered data privacy laws. These laws impose, or have the potential to impose, additional obligations on companies that collect, store, use, retain, disclose, transfer and otherwise process confidential, sensitive and personal information, and will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally. Although there are similarities between the data privacy laws enacted in California, Virginia and Colorado (along with the laws that have been proposed in other states), there are also substantive aspects of the laws that differ markedly. This lack of uniformity, which we expect to continue as other states enact data privacy laws, creates significant legal complexities for companies (such as TriNet) that operate nationwide and are required to comply with a patchwork of privacy laws. Moreover, all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Canada have enacted data breach notification laws that may require us to notify WSEs, clients, employees, third parties or regulators in the event of unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal or confidential information. Complying with existing and new data privacy and security regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Any failure to comply with existing and new data privacy and security regulations could result in significant penalties, damage our reputation and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. For additional information on the privacy and security of the confidential, sensitive and personal information and PHI we possess and the potential impact to our business if we fail to protect such information, refer to each of the risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K, under the heading - "Data Privacy and Security Risks".
PEO Licensing Laws
Nearly all states have adopted laws and regulations for licensing, registration, certification or recognition of PEOs and the IRS has implemented a voluntary federal certification program for PEOs. We expect states without such laws and regulations to adopt them in the future. While these laws and regulations can vary widely, most regulators monitor the financial health and other relevant business information of PEOs on an annual or quarterly basis. In some cases, these laws and regulations codify and clarify the co-employment relationship for certain payroll, unemployment, workers' compensation and other employment-related purposes or require specific client contractual terms and/or WSE disclosures. We believe we comply in all material respects with the applicable PEO laws and regulations in each state and jurisdiction in which we operate. 

TRINET | 2021 FORM 10-K


BUSINESS

Payroll Taxes, Unemployment Taxes and Payroll Tax Credits
We must also comply with the federal and state payroll tax and unemployment tax requirements that apply where our clients are located. Tax reform efforts, and other payroll tax changes, at the federal, state and local level can impact our payroll tax reporting obligations for our clients and the services we can provide. State unemployment tax rates vary by state based, in part, on prior years’ compensation and unemployment claims experience and may also vary based on the overall claims experience of a PEO. As a result, depending on where clients are located, the fees we charge for unemployment taxes can be higher or lower than a client could obtain alone. In some cases, taxing authorities can retroactively increase the unemployment taxes we pay to cover deficiencies in the unemployment tax funds. We also rely on our clients to accurately report their WSEs' work locations and inaccurate reporting, due to work from home policies during the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, can impact our payroll tax obligations and the obligations of our clients and WSEs.
We have seen a growing trend, particularly at the federal level, of using payroll tax credits, deferrals and other related payroll tax programs as a mechanism for incentivizing SMB development and/or economic recovery. These programs are popular because they allow SMBs, which often have income tax losses, to realize benefits via payroll tax reductions, rather than income tax reductions. As a result, many of our SMB clients demand that we support these programs. Examples of these programs include the 2015 PATH Act, which allows SMBs to use research and development tax credits submitted on the SMB’s income tax return to reduce payroll taxes, and the CARES Act and FFCRA Act payroll tax credit and payroll tax deferral programs enacted in 2020 and 2021, which allow SMBs to defer certain payroll tax obligations to a later date or to receive payroll tax reductions and refunds based on SMB employment practices that are beyond a PEO’s control. These programs have generally not been designed with the PEO industry in mind and these programs are subject to broad agency interpretations given their complexity. For additional information tax credit programs, and the risks they post to our operations, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K, under the heading - "Our business is subject to numerous complex laws, and changes in, uncertainty regarding, or adverse application of these laws could negatively affect our business."
Other Employment Regulations
We must also comply with labor and employment laws, which can change frequently at the federal, state and local level. In particular, regulatory focus on the classification of employers, employees and independent contractors has the potential to significantly change how we and other PEOs operate and the services that we and other PEOs can provide to our clients and WSEs. For example, in September 2019, California passed AB5, a law that could potentially reclassify client independent contractors as employees by establishing the ABC test to determine if a worker is an employee or independent contractor for most occupations. On September 30, 2021, and effective January 1, 2022, California expanded the number of occupations exempt from the ABC test. In November 2020, California voters passed Proposition 22, which supersedes AB5 for certain types of contractors. On August 20, 2021, a California state court found that portions of Proposition 22 were unconstitutional and further held that the entirety of Proposition 22 was unenforceable. Effective July 1, 2021, Alabama adopted the IRS’s 20-factor test to determine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor, while on August 1, 2021, Louisiana started using an 11-factor test under its unemployment law to determine worker classification. 
The legal landscape is also in flux at the federal level. In 2020, the DOL issued a rule changing the definition of joint employer used under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) which was later rescinded in 2021. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) announced plans to create a new rule in 2022 for determining whether two businesses are joint employers under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), while the DOL plans to start on a new rule to raise the salary required for the executive, administrative and professional exemptions under the FLSA. We do not believe that we are, or will be, a joint employer under the FLSA rules, but the impact of new regulations like these could lead to increased legal claims against us or our clients, increase our compliance costs, or require changes to how we operate our business and the services we provide to our clients and WSEs. For additional information, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K, under the heading - "The definition of employers, employees and independent contractors is evolving. Changes to the laws and regulations that govern what it means to be an employer or an employee may require us to make significant changes in our operations and may negatively affect our business".

Our Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 364,900 WSEs and 2,800 corporate employees, or colleagues. 
Oversight and Management
At TriNet, we rally around a shared vision of improving humanity through business growth and innovation. We recognize the incredible opportunity that can only be realized by working together, with a shared view of how we support our clients and WSEs. This is illustrated in our core values:
•Lead with the customer - We are accessible, responsive and empowered to serve our customers. We are successful when our customers are successful.
•Stand together - We bring together diverse backgrounds, experiences and ideas to create better outcomes. We collaborate across boundaries, communicate openly and respect each other.
•Act with integrity - We are honest, transparent, ethical and fair. We take pride in always doing what’s right for our customers and colleagues.
•Make an impact - We act with purpose, are deliberate in our planning and quick in execution. We are accountable to each other and empowered to make decisions.

We regularly conduct surveys to seek feedback from our colleagues on a variety of topics, including confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and opportunities to improve the attractiveness of our company with existing and potential colleagues. The results are shared with our colleagues and reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in colleague engagement. None of our corporate colleagues are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Attracting and Retaining Our Colleagues
We must attract, develop and retain highly motivated and qualified colleagues to continue to provide the services that our clients need, to achieve our strategic objectives, and to grow our business. We do this by:
•offering competitive compensation and benefits packages, including comprehensive health benefits and our 401(k) retirement savings plan, with an immediately vested employer match of up to 4% of cash compensation,
•supporting a pay for performance culture through the use of cash and equity incentives tied to the performance of our company and individual performance,
•offering an employee stock purchase plan that allows our colleagues to purchase our shares at a discount to market value, which fosters a stronger sense of ownership and aligns the interests of our colleagues with our stockholders,
•investing in the professional growth of our colleagues with tuition and continuing education reimbursement, wellbeing programs, and comprehensive training and development activities and opportunities both inside and outside of our company,
•creating and maintaining a diverse and inclusive colleague base by, for example, the use of colleague-led resource groups and by launching a new diversity and inclusion training curriculum for our colleagues in 2020, and
•supporting our colleagues during the COVID-19 pandemic by adopting work-from-home policies, halting non-critical travel, and providing additional paid time off, employee assistance plans, and access to telemedicine services.
We refer to our employees that are co-employed with our clients as our worksite employees (WSE). For more information about how we help our clients manage their own human capital resources and satisfy their own HR-related needs, see the section above titled “Our Services”.

BUSINESS

Our Approach to Acquisitions
Historically, we have pursued acquisitions to both expand our service capabilities and supplement our growth across geographies and certain industry verticals. Our acquisition targets have included PEOs and other HR solution providers as well as technology companies or technology product offerings to supplement or enhance our existing HR solutions. In December 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Zenefits, a leading cloud HR platform which provides innovative and intuitive HR, benefits, payroll and employee engagement software purpose-built for SMBs. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions, where appropriate, that will enable us to add new clients and WSEs, expand our presence in certain geographies or industry verticals and offer our clients and WSEs more attractive services.
The Impact of Seasonality on Our Business
Our business is affected by seasonality in client business activity and WSE benefit selection, health claims costs and payroll taxes:
•Clients generally change their payroll service providers at the beginning of the payroll tax year; as a result, we have historically experienced our highest volumes of new clients and terminating clients in the month of January.
•WSEs select our benefit plans during their respective open enrollment periods, which occur throughout the year. We have historically experienced the largest proportion of WSE benefit changes in the first quarter and fourth quarter.
•Health claims costs tend to increase throughout the year as the utilization of medical services above each WSE's deductible causes our insurance costs to increase. In addition, the overall use of medical services by WSEs, including elective procedures, tends to increase later in the calendar year. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed significant fluctuations in the typical seasonal use of medical services by our WSEs. The COVID-19 pandemic and emerging variants may continue to cause variability in our WSE's medical services utilization that may result in changes in this seasonal trend in our business. 
•Certain payroll tax related billings are based on the WSE's annual taxable wage base up to a set cap. WSEs frequently meet these wage base caps in the first two quarters of the year, depending on the WSE's compensation level, resulting in lower related billing contributions to PSR in the latter half of the year.
Our Owned and Licensed Intellectual Property 
We own or license from third parties various computer software, as well as other intellectual property rights, used in our business. Generally, we protect our intellectual property rights through the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and policies with our employees and third-party partners and vendors. We also own registered trademarks in the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the European Union covering our name and other trademarks and logos that we believe are materially important to our operations. We generally protect our trademarks through federal registration or through the commercial use of our trademarks. Trademark registrations must generally be renewed every five to ten years and we renew the registration of trademarks that we deem to have continuing value to our business.
