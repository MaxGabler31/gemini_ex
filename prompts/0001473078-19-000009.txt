Overview
Chesapeake Lodging Trust (the “Trust”) is a self-advised real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that was organized in the state of Maryland in June 2009. We are focused on investments primarily in upper-upscale hotels in major business and convention markets and, on a selective basis, premium select-service hotels in urban settings or unique locations in the United States of America (“U.S.”). We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in January 2010 and own 20 hotels as of the date of this filing.
Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, Chesapeake Lodging, L.P., our operating partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). In order for us to qualify as a REIT, neither the Trust nor the Operating Partnership can operate hotels directly. Therefore, the Operating Partnership leases its hotels to taxable REIT subsidiaries (each, a “TRS”), which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are treated as TRSs for federal income tax purposes. The TRSs then engage hotel management companies to operate the hotels pursuant to management agreements. 
Our corporate office is located at 4300 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 625, Arlington, Virginia 22203. Our telephone number is (571) 349-9450.
Industry and Trust Background
Historically, the lodging industry in the U.S. has been cyclical in nature. Lodging industry performance is a function of lodging demand and supply and generally, correlates with macroeconomic conditions. Fluctuations in lodging demand are caused largely by general economic and local market conditions, which affect levels of business and leisure travel. Fluctuations in lodging supply typically are driven by levels of overall lodging demand as extended periods of strong lodging demand growth tend to encourage new hotel development and an increase in lodging supply. However, the rate of lodging supply growth is also influenced by a number of additional factors, including availability and cost of capital, construction costs, local market considerations, and considerations of alternatives for and best uses of properties.
From 2003 to 2008, pricing of hotels in the U.S. appreciated well in excess of the hotels’ underlying performance, primarily driven by record levels of debt financing. Beginning in 2008, the U.S. lodging industry experienced a significant downturn due to a decline in consumer and business spending as a result of the weakness in the global economy, particularly the turmoil in the credit markets, erosion of consumer confidence and increasing unemployment. As a result, lodging demand from both leisure and business travelers decreased significantly in 2008 and 2009. This decreased demand for hotel rooms, together with increases in lodging supply in 2008 and 2009 due to the completion of hotels under development before the global recession began, resulted in declines in occupancy and reductions in average daily rate (“ADR”) as hotels competed more aggressively for guests. These events had a substantial negative impact on revenue per available room (“RevPAR”). According to STR, Inc. (“STR”), a leading source of lodging industry information, RevPAR declined 16.7% in 2009, the largest decline recorded since they began tracking the U.S. lodging industry, and a significantly larger decline than the two previous lodging industry downturns in 1991 and 2001-2002.
From 2008 through early 2010, a significant correction in the value of hotels occurred, primarily as a result of the impact of the economic downturn on the lodging industry. In addition, during this period, due to the widely publicized credit crisis, the market for commercial mortgage backed securities was virtually closed, and many traditional real estate lenders, such as national and regional banks and insurance companies, saw their balance sheets impaired, which resulted in a severe contraction in available debt financing for hotels, which further impacted hotel values.
The Trust was founded to capitalize on the opportunity created by this lodging industry downturn. Since completing our IPO in 2010 and through the first half of 2015, we took advantage of industry conditions to acquire our current portfolio of 20 hotels, consisting of 6,279 rooms, at prices generally below replacement cost, with attractive yields and upside potential. We have followed a disciplined strategy to acquire hotels generally concentrated in the central business districts of top U.S. lodging markets, which historically have had high barriers-to-entry. Our portfolio reflects our strong efforts to establish geographic diversification, with hotels in eight states and the District of Columbia, but maintains a clear focus on the most important U.S. lodging markets.
The lodging industry has recovered significantly since our IPO. Industry-wide RevPAR from 2010 through 2018 increased 61.8%, as reported by STR, and in 2013, surpassed the prior peak established in 2007, as a result of continued improvements in hotel occupancy levels and ADR, and below historical average growth in lodging supply. These positive lodging fundamentals moderated over the last couple years however, primarily as a result of the rate of lodging supply growth approaching historical average levels. In 2018, the rate of lodging demand growth (2.5%, as reported by STR) exceeded the rate of lodging supply growth (2.0%, as reported by STR), resulting in industry-wide RevPAR increasing by 2.9%, as reported by STR. Several 
4

industry prognosticators, including STR, expect similar, or slightly lower, levels of RevPAR growth over the next few years as that experienced by the industry in 2018.
We continue to believe our hotel portfolio is well positioned for future performance and long-term real estate value appreciation as a result of our focus on high-quality hotels located in major U.S. lodging markets. However, in light of the lower levels of RevPAR growth expected over the next few years combined with sellers’ pricing expectations in the transaction market currently, we expect limited, if any, acquisition activity over the near term and we may continue to evaluate opportunities to dispose of hotels that we believe have maximized their values.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to deliver strong total returns to our shareholders in the form of the appreciation of our assets and our ability to return funds to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We intend to pursue the following strategies to achieve this goal:
Identify and pursue value-added investments at our hotels. We employ value-added strategies designed to improve the operating performance and value of our hotels. We have focused a significant portion of our efforts on identifying and pursuing investments to promote the competitive positioning and operations of our hotels, and we intend to continue our aggressive efforts in this regard. Examples include the approximate $7 million renovation and repositioning of the Hotel Adagio San Francisco in 2012, enabling the hotel to become part of the Marriott Autograph Collection; the approximate $5 million we spent in 2012 to create 35 additional guestrooms on the top two, previously vacant, floors of the W Chicago – City Center; and in 2014, the completion of three major investments, including the approximate $37 million comprehensive renovation at our W Chicago – Lakeshore, the approximate $25 million comprehensive renovation of our former W New Orleans to re-brand the hotel as the Le Meridien New Orleans, and the approximate $8 million comprehensive renovation of our former Holiday Inn New York City Midtown – 31st Street to re-brand the hotel as the Hyatt Herald Square New York.
Optimize the branding and management of our hotels. We regularly evaluate opportunities to re-brand certain hotels by determining which brands are available in the market, seeking to quantify the potential improvement in revenue generation and profitability that a hotel might experience under a new brand. We analyze these opportunities by reviewing the revenue data of the local competitive set of hotels that are branded most similarly to the proposed new brand for the hotel, which data we obtain from STR. Based on this data, we project the expected revenue for the hotel with the new brand and use hotel industry standards for profit margins, and our own operating history, to calculate potential profits. We then compare the potential profits to the expected capital costs to bring the hotel into compliance with the standards of the proposed new brand to calculate a return on investment, which we use to determine whether it is in our shareholders’ interests to undertake the re-branding project. Examples of our deployment of this strategy can be found in the repositioning of the previously independent Hotel Adagio San Francisco to become part of the Marriott Autograph Collection in 2013, and the conversions of our former W New Orleans to the Le Meridien brand and our former Holiday Inn New York City Midtown – 31st Street to the Hyatt brand in 2014. Likewise, we continually evaluate the performance of the third parties managing each of our hotels and evaluate whether a hotel might perform better under different managerial control. In this regard, we review the operating performance of the hotel and compare that with its local competitive set and industry standards, as well as our experience in our dealings with the 10 management companies currently operating our hotels. In accordance with this strategy, we replaced the management company operating our two hotels located in New York in October 2016 and the brand management company operating our hotel located in Denver in December 2017. We will continue to pursue a change in a hotel’s management company when we determine the benefits of a change outweigh the costs.
Selectively expand our hotel portfolio through new investments. We may continue our efforts to grow our business by acquiring additional hotels that meet our qualitative and quantitative investment criteria, which may change depending upon our assessment of, among other things, our cost of capital, liquidity, and expectations regarding future lodging industry fundamentals and macroeconomic conditions. We have and will continue to focus our efforts on upper-upscale hotels operating under national franchise brands located in the top 25 U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas, in close proximity to major market demand generators that are attractive to business travelers. Our team may continue to target acquisitions that we believe would strengthen the overall quality of our hotel portfolio and further diversify the portfolio by market, customer type and brand. While we anticipate that we would continue to focus on acquiring hotels that are proven leaders in market share, setting the rates in the market and providing superior meeting space, services or amenities, and in good physical condition, we may be opportunistic in evaluating acquisition opportunities that might involve near-term renovations, re-branding or management changes under the methods described above. From a financial perspective, we expect to be conservative in our underwriting of the potential returns on investment when evaluating any new acquisition opportunities, which we believe is prudent given the cyclical nature of the lodging industry, and the lack of certainty as to the duration of any growth period.
Evaluate opportunities to redeploy capital. We regularly review the hotels in our portfolio to ensure that they continue to meet our investment criteria. If we were to conclude that a hotel’s value has been maximized, or that it no longer fits within our financial or strategic criteria, we may seek to sell the hotel and plan to use the proceeds, net of any retirement of related debt, to supplement our capital for use in future investments in our existing or new hotels or to reduce the Trust’s overall leverage. In accordance with this strategy, in 2014, we sold the Courtyard Anaheim at Disneyland Resort, an upscale hotel located in a 
5

market with a significant increase in lodging supply expected at the time, for $32.5 million and used the net proceeds to partially fund the subsequent acquisition of the JW Marriott San Francisco Union Square, a high-quality hotel located in the favorable San Francisco market, for a purchase price of $147.2 million; in 2017, we sold The Hotel Minneapolis, Autograph Collection, a hotel located in a market that was experiencing a significant increase in lodging supply, for $46.0 million; and in 2018, we sold the Hyatt Centric Santa Barbara for $90.0 million, taking advantage of the strong pricing seen in the hotel transaction market.
Maintain our conservative capital structure to preserve financial flexibility. Since our IPO in 2010, we have maintained discipline in targeting an overall debt level not to exceed 40% of the aggregate value of all of our hotels (as calculated in accordance with our revolving credit facility). At the same time, we have secured long-term, low interest rate financing on favorable terms. We believe our strong balance sheet offers us the dual benefit of the ability to move rapidly to capitalize on favorable investment opportunities, as well as to maintain or increase the level of dividends we pay our shareholders over time.
Hotel Operating Agreements
The following are general descriptions of our management agreements, franchise agreements and TRS lease agreements:
Management agreements
We have entered into management agreements with third parties to manage our hotels. Our hotel managers generally have sole responsibility and authority for the hotel’s day to day operations and provide all managerial and other hotel employees, oversee operations and maintenance, prepare reports, budgets and projections and provide other administrative and accounting support services. We structure our hotel management agreements to allow us to closely monitor the performance of our hotels and to ensure, among other things, that our third-party managers: (1) implement an approved business and marketing plan; (2) implement a disciplined capital expenditure program; and (3) establish and prudently spend appropriate furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FF&E”) reserves.
Our current management agreements generally provide for base management fees ranging from 2% to 4% of gross hotel revenues and incentive compensation if hotel operating income, as defined in the management agreements, exceeds certain performance thresholds. The incentive management fee is generally calculated as a percentage of hotel operating income after we have received a priority return on our investment in the hotel. The terms of our management agreements generally range from five to 20 years initially, with certain extension and renewal periods. In addition, we may, in certain circumstances, terminate each of the management agreements before the expiration of the initial term if the particular hotel fails to meet specified performance objectives, generally targeted levels of RevPAR and gross operating profit, for specified periods. In addition, certain management agreements impose conditions with respect to (1) levels of mortgage loan financing and (2) conveyances of the hotel or any direct or indirect interest therein to third parties.
Franchise agreements
Of our 20 current hotels, 10 operate pursuant to franchise agreements with hotel brand companies and 10 operate pursuant to management agreements with hotel brand companies that allow them to operate under their respective brands. Under the 10 franchise agreements, we generally pay a royalty fee ranging from 3% to 6% of room revenues and up to 3% of food and beverage revenues, plus additional fees for marketing, central reservation systems, and other franchisor costs that amount to between 1% and 5% of room revenues. The terms of our franchise agreements generally range from 10 to 20 years initially, with certain extension and renewal periods. The franchise agreements specify certain management, operational, recordkeeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which we must comply. The agreements also obligate us to comply with the franchisor’s standards and requirements with respect to training of operational personnel, safety, maintaining specified insurance, the types of services and products ancillary to guest room services that may be provided by us, display of signs, and the type, quality and age of FF&E included in guest rooms, lobbies and other common areas. In addition, certain franchise agreements impose conditions with respect to (1) levels of mortgage loan financing and (2) conveyances of the hotel or any direct or indirect interest therein to third parties.
TRS lease agreements
Our TRS lease agreements are inter-company agreements between our property-owning subsidiaries and our TRS lessees. These agreements generally contain customary terms for third-party lease agreements, including customary terms regarding lease payments and other expenses.
Tax Status
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains) to our shareholders. We believe that we have operated and it is our current intention to continue to operate in satisfaction of these requirements and to meet the qualifications for taxation as a 
6

REIT. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our taxable income that is currently distributed to shareholders. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, taxable income from activities conducted by our TRSs are subject to federal and state income taxes.
Seasonality
Demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns. For non-resort properties, demand is generally lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during the peak travel season. For resort properties, demand is generally higher in the winter months. We expect that our operations will generally reflect non-resort seasonality patterns. Accordingly, we expect that we will have lower revenue, hotel operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue, hotel operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters. These general trends are, however, expected to be greatly influenced by overall economic cycles.
Competition
We believe that competition for the acquisition of hotels is highly fragmented. We face competition from institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs and numerous local, regional, national, and foreign owners, including franchisors. Some of these entities may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able and willing to accept more risk than we can prudently manage. Competition generally may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell and reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us.
The hotel industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels and, to a lesser extent, lodging alternatives such as Airbnb, HomeAway and VRBO, for guests in each market in which we operate. Competitive advantage is based on a number of factors, including location, convenience, brand affiliation, room rates, range of services and guest amenities or accommodations offered, and quality of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual market in which a hotel is located and includes competition from existing and new hotels operated under brands in the relevant segments. Increased competition could harm our occupancy, ADR and RevPAR, or may require us to provide additional amenities or make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, which may reduce our profitability.
Regulation
Our hotels are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe each of our hotels has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business, and each is adequately covered by insurance.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Our hotels must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) to the extent that such hotels are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our hotels where such removal is readily achievable. Although we believe that the hotels in our portfolio substantially comply with present requirements of the ADA, we have not conducted a comprehensive audit or investigation of all of our hotels to determine our compliance, and one or more hotels may not be fully compliant with the ADA. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the incurrence of additional costs to attain compliance. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our hotels and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Environmental matters
Our hotels are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws that impose liability for contamination. Under these laws, governmental entities have the authority to require us, as the current owner of the property, to perform or pay for the cleanup of contamination (including hazardous substances, waste or petroleum products) at, on, under or emanating from the property and to pay for natural resource damages arising from such contamination. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator or other responsible party knew of, or caused such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. Because these laws also impose liability on persons who owned the property at the time it became contaminated, it is possible we could incur cleanup costs or other environmental liabilities even after we sell properties. Contamination at, on, under or emanating from our properties also may expose us to liability to private parties for costs of remediation and/or personal injury or property damage. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. If contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which the property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. Moreover, environmental contamination can affect 
7

the value of a property and, therefore, an owner’s ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property on favorable terms or at all. 
Some of our properties may have contained historic uses which involved the use and/or storage of hazardous chemicals and petroleum products (e.g., storage tanks, gas stations, dry cleaning operations) which, if released, could have impacted our properties. In addition, some of our properties may be near or adjacent to other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks containing petroleum products or conducted or currently conduct operations which utilize other hazardous or toxic substances. Releases from these adjacent or surrounding properties could impact our properties.
Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I environmental site assessments on all of the properties in our portfolio and we intend to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments on any properties we may acquire in the future. Phase I site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties. These assessments do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey. None of the existing Phase I site assessments revealed any past or present environmental condition that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations. However, the assessments may have failed to reveal all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns. Material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future; and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability.
In addition, our hotels are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety regulatory requirements that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and wastewater discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew, and waste management. Some of our hotels routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations, which are subject to regulation (e.g., swimming pool chemicals). Our hotels incur costs to comply with these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and could be subject to fines and penalties for non-compliance with applicable laws. However, we are aware of no past or present environmental liability for non-compliance with environmental laws that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.
Certain hotels we currently own or those we acquire in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material (“ACM”). Environmental, health and safety laws require that ACM be properly managed and maintained, and include requirements to undertake special precautions, such as removal or abatement, if ACM would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation, or demolition of a building. Such laws regarding ACM may impose fines and penalties on building owners, employers and operators for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third-party liability. However, we manage such ACM under asbestos operations and maintenance plans, which we have developed and implemented at each of our hotels where there is known ACM or for which suspected ACM is present.
When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants, such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from third parties if property damage or personal injury occurs. We are not presently aware of any indoor air quality issues at our properties that could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Employees
As of the date of this filing, we had 13 employees. All persons employed in the day to day operations of our hotels are employees of the management companies engaged by our TRS lessees to operate such hotels.
