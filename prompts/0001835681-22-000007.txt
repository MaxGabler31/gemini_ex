Our Mission
We empower the K-12 education ecosystem of schools, districts and education departments to enable parents, educators and administrators to deliver the best education to children, allowing them to realize their potential.
Company Overview
At PowerSchool, we believe in the simple truth that every student deserves the best opportunities in life. Unfortunately, because adoption of technology in education has lagged behind other sectors, K-12 schools and school districts, and ultimately their students and families, have yet to experience all the benefits from digital transformation. That’s why we seek to power the education ecosystem with unified technology that helps educators and students realize their potential, in their way. A digital transformation in education is currently under way, unleashing tremendous potential, surfacing insights and driving efficiencies, and we believe all administrators, educators and students are entitled to benefit from this advancement.
As a pioneer and the leading provider of cloud-based software to the K-12 education market, we provide a comprehensive suite of cloud solutions that deliver a broad range of mission-critical capabilities to K-12 organizations in over 90 countries globally (our “Unified Platform”) that includes the core system of record used by districts and schools and leverages our rich data to deliver insights and analytics to improve education outcomes. We serve more than 14,000 customers, including over 90 of the 100 top districts by student enrollment in the United States, have 30 state-, province-, or territory-wide contracts in North America, and sell solutions in over 90 countries globally. Our solution is embedded in school workflows and is used on a daily basis by educators, students, administrators and parents in schools and districts representing over 45 million students globally, over 70% of all K-12 students in the U.S. and Canada. Our cloud-based technology platform helps schools and districts efficiently 
manage state reporting and related compliance, special education, finance, HR, talent, registration, attendance, funding, learning, instruction, grading, college and career readiness, assessments and analytics in one place. Through our Unified Platform approach, we help our customers streamline operations, aggregate disparate data sets, and develop insights using predictive modelling and machine learning. Our ability to transform information into actionable insights improves the efficiency of school operations, the quality of instruction delivered by teachers, and the pace of student growth, which we believe should have a profound effect on K-12 educational outcomes.
Our broad scale, engagement with all constituents and single-sector focus has made us one of the most recognizable and trusted brands in the K-12 market. We achieved our leadership position by combining over twenty years of deep expertise with our vision to create modern technology to automate and streamline inefficient processes, aggregate critical data in central system of record systems, and utilize assessment and data analytics to help students succeed. 
School districts have steadily increased investment in cloud-based software solutions, and we expect the adoption trend to accelerate post- COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic created a seminal moment for education, driving secular step-function changes in the pace of technology adoption. These recent events have also exposed the lack of technological readiness in many schools and districts. Faced with extended closures, school leadership had to rapidly mobilize resources to confront the acute technical, instructional, and administrative challenges of maintaining uninterrupted learning, teaching and operations. According to Gartner®1 (the “Gartner Forecast”), external IT spending in K-12 schools in the U.S. and Canada is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9% from 2020 to 2025, from approximately $17 billion to $26 billion.
Our customers include every major type of K-12 organization across a range of sizes. Our solutions are mission-critical and foster a high degree of customer loyalty, resulting in long-standing and stable customer relationships. PowerSchool has grown rapidly over the last several years and we plan to continue to deepen our relationships with existing customers by providing strong customer support, cross-selling incremental solutions and integrating point solutions for customers. 
Industry Background
K-12 education is an essential industry to society and one of the largest vertical end-markets in the global economy, representing the third highest discretionary spend category by the United States government in 2019. According to data from the National Center of Education Statistics and Statistics Canada, over $900 billion is spent each year on K-12 education in the United States and Canada, with approximately 61 million students enrolled in public and private K-12 institutions in 2020. The quality of our education system drives our quality of life and overall economic prosperity. The success of K- 12 education depends upon a vibrant ecosystem of participants that includes students, parents, teachers and administrators—each with their own needs, opportunities and challenges.
Schools are undergoing a dynamic digital transformation through the adoption of cloud-based software that is helping to improve collaboration, communication and curricula, utilizing rich data and analytics to surface educational insight, and automating office operations. K-12 software spending includes instructional and non-instructional resources that track and analyze student performance, manage classroom activities, facilitate HR and support enterprise resource planning while streamlining administrative functions. Districts and schools are increasingly seeking integrated cloud platforms due to the ease of accessibility, lower up-front investment, scaled and secure data practices, simplified implementation and growing comfort with subscription-based models.
Real-time Data and Insights are Needed for District and Student Success
Students, parents, teachers and administrators lack real-time information and comprehensive ways to view student, educator and operational data. Existing systems that manage student and teacher data are often paper-based, cumbersome and have limited ability to effectively aggregate student performance information. In addition, full assessments of student capabilities typically occur during end-of-year final exams, at which point it is too late for teachers to address gaps in understanding. This summative data also does not provide educators with information about the underlying factors influencing or impeding learning, which is key to moving students forward. Without this

data, schools struggle to provide parents with the appropriate level of transparency into their child’s performance. A study from Learning Heroes stated that 92% of parents believe their children are performing at or above their grade level in reading and math, while in reality only 37% of students achieve proficiency. Additionally, according to EducationData.org, dropout rates increased to 4.7% in 2017, up from 3.5% in 2007. Our Unified Platform helps to solve these challenges caused by lack of access to real-time, comprehensive data, providing insights to help educators and administrators drive district and student success.
Teachers and Administrators Lack Resources to Deliver Personalized Learning
Students learn best when education is tailored to their individual needs, yet most of our education system is built on a one-size-fits-all pedagogy targeting the average student. Teachers, despite their best intentions, are often required to juggle several disparate solutions in the classroom for delivering instruction and managing students, resulting in a lack of time and information needed to address each child’s unique and changing needs. According to a McKinsey & Company study, How Artificial Intelligence Will Impact K-12 Teachers, published January 2020 (the “McKinsey Study”), only 49% of a teacher’s time is spent directly with students. Our suite offers teachers and administrators the information, insights, and time necessary to personalize instruction at an individual student level.
Widespread Teacher Shortages Will Have a Long-Term Impact on Educational Outcomes
One of the most profound issues impacting K-12 organizations is a long-term shortage in educators. Substandard opportunities for professional development contribute to poor teacher retention rates and widespread educator shortages. These shortages, along with budget constraints, are leading to substandard instruction and limiting the time and attention given to students. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated K-12 staffing problems, with the lowest public school employment levels since 2000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Recruiting, retaining and training high quality teachers has become an imperative for school districts, many of which continue to rely on paper-based processes and lack the network to optimize talent management. In addition, the ability to find qualified substitute teachers has become more difficult, impacting districts’ abilities to manage absences and deliver consistent educational outcomes.
The K-12 Regulatory Environment is Highly Complex
Schools and districts are required to comply with growing volumes of local, state and federal regulations, many of which are directly tied to a school or district’s ability to access funding. The substantial level of investment required for vendors to create and continually adhere to K-12 compliance mandates makes software development very challenging. This limits and, in some cases, prevents the emergence of potentially novel technology, while preserving legacy point solutions and outdated, often manual or paper-based processes. Many schools and districts still rely on spreadsheets, home-grown platforms and/or dozens of technology vendors with little integration between various tools, exacerbating the challenges teachers and administrators face.
Legacy, Compartmentalized K-12 Software Has Fallen Short
K-12 schools and districts have lagged other end-markets in terms of technology adoption. Most K-12 software was designed as point solutions (Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”), Learning Management System (“LMS”), Student Information System (“SIS”), assessments, etc.), which fail to provide harmonized, integrated, and accurate data that meet the needs of students, parents, teachers and administrators. According to a survey conducted by Digital Promise in 2017, 74% of U.S. districts use more than 26 different technology products and only 33% of districts have integrated the majority of their technology tools. K-12 constituents are forced to navigate numerous fragmented platforms with information residing in disparate data silos. This has led to wasted time, lost productivity and has limited the ability of schools and districts to use data to improve education outcomes. Broad platforms with unified data have become a technology imperative to allow teachers to focus more on students and to drive improvement in critical education indicators on which the U.S. is lagging:
•Based on ACT data, less than 45% of students are prepared for college-level math, science or reading
•NCES data indicates that over 500,000 high school students drop out annually
•According to the Programme for International Student Assessment, Insights and Interpretations, published in 2018 the United States ranks 25th on the International Student Assessment average across math, reading and science
K-12 Education is Being Reimagined
We believe the way teachers educate, students learn and parents partner with schools is permanently changing. As technology solutions have improved and students have greater access to devices, schools and districts have embarked on their digital transformation. In addition, the COVID- 19 pandemic forced stakeholders to accelerate this shift and test new methods of hybrid learning. We believe the current backdrop and requirement to maintain operational continuity through remote operations has put a spotlight on the need for schools to modernize their software platforms and technology infrastructure. These secular trends are causing districts to rapidly move towards implementing cloud-based platforms capable of unifying the learning experience, information, engagement, and the core systems of record.
Shift to Data-Driven Education
We believe a data-driven approach to education is central to how students, educators, parents and administrators reinvent the K-12 education experience. Real-time collaboration and engagement, deep analytics and rich information management are helping to fulfill the promise of digital transformation, workplace optimization and elevating student success. There are several ways that data and analytics are transforming education, including:
•Integration. Districts have recognized the value of data in education and have generated volumes of it; unfortunately, this data is underutilized because it often sits in disparate silos and in incongruent formats. Without integrating systems of data generation, accumulation and interpretation, the value of the data is materially diminished. Our Unified Platform integrates systems and data, and helps educators and administrators implement data-driven education initiatives.
•Actionable Insight. Actionable intelligence offers the ability to synthesize disparate data sets into reportable information. Using real- time data helps improve a range of processes including creating personalized learning programs using student achievement data, making investment decisions using data from our ERP, and managing staffing and professional development improvements using our talent solutions.
•Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning (“ML”).  AI/ML is crucial to processing and analyzing data to provide novel insights such as identifying at-risk student before they fall too far behind, identifying staff retention risk areas, and optimizing district investments. According to IDC, Spending Guide, published in (2019), education is among the top three opportunities for AI deployment.
•Process Automation. School districts are modernizing and automating processes that have historically been done manually. Dynamic data models are increasingly being used to monitor processes, tasks and decisions to increase efficiency and allow teachers to focus on activities that lead to better student outcomes and higher teacher satisfaction. According to the McKinsey Study, teachers spend approximately 13 hours per week on activities that could be automated using existing technology.
Market Opportunity
PowerSchool serves a large addressable market opportunity globally as school districts continue to make significant investments in IT applications and infrastructure. In 2020, approximately $17 billion was spent on K-12 technology (of which $12 billion represents spending on software and IT services) in the U.S. and Canada and this is expected to increase approximately 9% per year from 2020 through 2025 according to the Gartner Forecast. Based on an analysis by Frost & Sullivan, Market Sizing Assessment for Education Technology Software Market - commissioned in 2020 in connection with our initial public offering (“IPO”), we estimate the global total available market for PowerSchool’s current set of solutions to be approximately $25 billion. To estimate our market opportunity, Frost & Sullivan identified the total number of K-12 students globally by country. Frost & Sullivan then multiplied the number of students within each country by the per student list price of our product segments, assuming deployment of each of the selected product segments and a distribution of K-12 organization sizes that is similar to those in the US.
Our Unified Platform
Mission-Critical System of Record, Engagement and Intelligence
Our Unified Platform provides a comprehensive suite of cloud solutions that deliver a broad range of mission-critical capabilities to K-12 organizations in over 90 countries globally.

Our Unified Platform is a comprehensive solution that connects the office, classroom and home while bringing together students, parents, teachers and administrators providing the following key benefits:
•Mission-Critical to District Funding and Compliance. Districts and schools must adhere to a myriad of constantly evolving federal and state-specific reporting requirements to receive a significant portion of their funding. These reports, data requirements, and submission guidelines vary state-to-state, and can be incredibly burdensome, oftentimes requiring dedicated functions within districts. Our compliance reporting solutions in PowerSchool SIS, PowerSchool Unified Classroom Special Programs, and PowerSchool Unified Administration eFinancePLUS (ERP) cover the ever-changing requirements of more than 50 U.S. states and Canadian provinces, providing more coverage for this mission-critical process than any other SIS vendor.
•Improves Productivity Through Automation and Simplification. Our PowerSchool Unified Administration and PowerSchool Unified Talent solutions are designed to simplify and digitally transform back-end ERP and human resources (“HR”) operations. These solutions modernize finance and HR workflows within the district, including budgeting, financial reporting, procurement, teacher and employee hiring, onboarding and staff development. Through automation of time-sensitive, manual processes such as filling temporary vacancies with substitute teachers, and focusing on educator efficacy with solutions for professional learning and staff evaluation, these solutions help optimize a district’s operations and allow more time and focus to be spent on classroom instruction and improving educator retention.
•Provides Real-time Insight, Transparency and Visibility. Our Unified Insights solution integrates data across functional areas including the office, classroom and home. This provides a holistic view from which all K-12 stakeholders can derive real-time insight, feedback, reporting, notifications and enhanced transparency. Educators and administrators use this visibility and data to closely track and benchmark academic successes and gaps within different demographic groups in their districts, understand location-based enrollment trends to help project funding inflows and requirements, and leverage predictive analytics to identify at-risk students. Additionally, communities gain unique insight into performance at the local, district and state level, which drives accountability for leadership.
•Enables Seamless Communication, Collaboration and Engagement. The PowerSchool Unified Platform seamlessly connects all K-12 stakeholders. Teachers can manage the full instructional process while interacting digitally with students inside and outside of the classroom. For example, through the PowerSchool Unified Classroom and its Schoology LMS, educators can effectively manage their classrooms and deliver instruction through a fully digital platform, while fostering real-time collaboration with their students. Our Unified Classroom provides dashboards that highlight achievement and learning gaps, and the ability to integrate high-quality, standards-aligned digital content from any vendor into their daily curriculum, giving educators the ability to assign personalized learning paths to students based on their individual needs. This functionality has been instrumental for blended and virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.
•Improves Education Outcomes. Our Unified Platform and organization are centered around the goal of helping educators and students realize their potential. By freeing up teacher time with PowerSchool SIS and Unified Classroom, empowering educators by driving parent and student engagement with Unified Home and Unified Communities, and giving administrators the visibility they need with Unified Insights, Unified Administration, and PowerSchool SIS, our solutions give our customers the time, tools, and data they need to focus energy on driving education outcomes rather than administrative tasks. We equip educators with the tools and information needed to deliver personalized instruction to each student. For example, through Unified Communities and Naviance, counselors can help students prepare for life after high school through assessments, planning tools, and curriculum that align to students’ competencies and goals.
•Reduces Operational Costs. We provide an integrated suite of easy-to-use cloud solutions that eliminate the need for disparate tools and related expenses associated with deploying, managing and maintaining them on-premises. By digitally transforming high frequency workflows and automating manual processes, schools are able to dramatically reduce their operating expenses. For example, our PowerSchool Enrollment solution supports the core online enrollment process by eliminating costly manual data entry and paperwork, reducing associated printing and mailing costs, and reducing time spent by parents enrolling and re-enrolling their children each year.

Customers are billed annually in advance, with a small number of customers billed semiannually, quarterly or monthly. We experience predictable annual renewal cycles, with a meaningful portion of invoices for service periods beginning in July and September.
Competition
The overall market for K-12 software is highly competitive and fragmented. Due to the comprehensive nature of our platform, we compete with education-focused vertical software providers, such as Blackboard and Frontline Education, as well as horizontal enterprise software providers, such as Workday and SAP that offer solutions across multiple verticals.
The actual and potential competition in each of our key solutions is described below:
•Student Information System. PowerSchool plays in a large and fragmented SIS market in which most competitors are sub-scale and regional. Currently, we compete with other national SIS providers such as Infinite Campus, Edupoint and Skyward.
•Unified Communities. Our leading college and career readiness solution faces competition from other education-technology providers, including Xello, SCOIR, and other providers.
•Unified Classroom. The market for classroom solutions is competitive. The main competitors for our Unified Classroom solution include systems offered by Instructure and Illuminate Education. In addition to the main competitors, Google and Microsoft have products, Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams, respectively, that serve the K-12 end-market. However, these products have limited features compared to a scalable district-wide LMS such as Schoology and often work alongside an LMS.
•Unified Admin. Our leading K-12 ERP software competes with K-12 focused ERP systems offered by Tyler Technologies and Skyward. From time-to-time, we face competition from Oracle, SAP, and other horizontal providers when selling to the largest school districts in the U.S.
•Unified Talent. Our Unified Talent solution faces competition from other education-technology and enterprise software providers, including Frontline Education, Eduphoria and other small local providers.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•Brand awareness, reputation and influence among Educators and Administrators;
•Products purpose-built for the K-12 market, as opposed to corporate enterprise systems that have been retrofit for the market;
•Breadth and depth of product offerings and functionality;
•Modern and intuitive technology and user experience;
•Ease of deployment and use;
•Software integration and third-party partnerships;
•Unified data and product integration between PowerSchool products;
•Total cost of ownership;
•Reliability and performance of solutions;
•Ability to provide advanced data analytics capabilities;
•Mobile capabilities; and
•Quality and availability of service and support.
We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors and that the significant compliance investment required for developing, marketing, and selling successful software solutions in the K-12 market may hinder new entrants that are unable to invest the necessary resources to develop and deploy software solutions with the same level of functionality, interoperability and compliance as ours. 
However, we recognize that many of our competitors may have adequate financial, technical and other resources. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our offerings. Furthermore, we expect that our space will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. While these new companies may bring new products to market, the K-12 education environment is slow to adopt unproven and untested products, making new company entrances difficult. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is focused on enhancing and integrating our solutions, advancing our data analytics capabilities and innovating in disruptive technologies, such as personalized learning. Our success is based on long-term investments in innovative product development and compliance that have enabled us to establish a leadership position in the North America K-12 market and create long-term customer relationships. 
Our research and development organization is comprised of teams based principally in the U.S. and India and focused on our various products and technologies that are designed to support our mission of helping K-12 organizations succeed with PowerSchool. We practice agile development methodologies that enable us to innovate at a rapid pace and at scale. As of December 31, 2021, our research and development team was comprised of approximately 994 employees, including product management and engineering personnel, which represents approximately 32% of our global employee base.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection.
We have registered “PowerSchool” and the “PowerSchool” logo as trademarks in the United States and other jurisdictions. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names related to our business.
We enter into agreements with our employees, contractors, customers, partners and other parties with which we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our technology and other proprietary information. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent the unauthorized access, use, copying or the reverse engineering of our technology and other proprietary information, including by third parties who may use our technology or other proprietary information to develop solutions and services that compete with ours. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe on, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property and proprietary rights, and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights can be difficult. The enforcement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights also depends on any legal actions we may bring against any such parties being successful, but these actions are costly, time-consuming and may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated.
Furthermore, effective patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our solutions are available, as the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights are uncertain and still evolving.
Companies in the software industry or non-practicing entities may own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property and proprietary rights, and these companies and entities have and may in the future request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of their intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Privacy and Government Regulation
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and in the education industry, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the Internet and education in general and how they will relate to our business in particular, are often unclear. For example, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the e-commerce and online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, defamation, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, financial 
aid, scholarships, student matriculation and recruitment, quality of solutions and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States, and in some cases internationally, that have a direct impact on our business and operations. For example:
•The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which imposes additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In addition, certain states, including Utah and Massachusetts, have laws that impose criminal penalties on the production and distribution of content that is “harmful to a minor.”
•The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which protects the privacy and restricts the disclosure of student information and generally prohibits an educational institution from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student’s education records without a parent’s consent if the student is younger than 18 years of age or the student’s consent if the student is 18 years of age or older.
•The U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, among other things, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
Data privacy and security with respect to the collection of personally identifiable information from students continues to be a focus of worldwide legislation and regulation. This includes significant regulation in the European Union and legislation and compliance requirements in various jurisdictions around the world. Within the United States, several states have enacted legislation that goes beyond any federal requirements relating to the collection of personally identifiable information from students. Examples include statutes adopted by the State of California and most other States that require online services to report certain breaches of the security of personal data; a California statute that requires companies to provide choice to California customers about whether their personal data is disclosed to direct marketers or to report to California customers when their personal data has been disclosed to direct marketers. In addition, our business is subject to laws specific to students, such as the Delaware Higher Education Privacy Act and a California statute which restricts the access by postsecondary educational institutions of prospective students’ social media account information. Compliance levels include disclosures, consents, transfer restrictions, notice and access provisions for which we may in the future need to build further infrastructure to further support.
We post our privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of student data on our website. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, Federal Trade Commission requirements or other privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings by governmental or regulatory bodies or by private litigants that could potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, there are a large number of legislative proposals before the United States Congress and various state legislative bodies regarding privacy issues related to our business. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted and certain proposals, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in student registrations and revenue. These decreases could be caused by, among other possible provisions, the required use of disclaimers or other requirements before students can utilize our services.
Due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to change previous regulatory schemes or choose to regulate transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws. We might unintentionally violate such laws, such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We may be subject to legal liability for our online services.
We maintain content usage review systems that, through a combination of manual and automated blocks, monitor potentially infringing content of which we become aware. Nevertheless, claims may continue to be brought and threatened against us for negligence, intellectual property infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of information, its origin and its distribution and there is no guarantee that we will be able to resolve any such claims quickly and without damage to us, our business model, our reputation or our operations.
We expect and plan for new laws, regulations and standards to be adopted over time that will be directly applicable to the Internet and to our student-focused activities. Any existing or new legislation applicable to our business could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations and potential penalties or fees for non-compliance, and could negatively impact growth.
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. See the discussion contained in the Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business.
Human Capital Management
We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining passionate talent at all levels is vital to continuing our success. By improving employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our customers and protect the long-term interests of our stakeholders and stockholders. We invest in our employees through high- quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives, and offer competitive compensation packages, ensuring fairness in internal compensation practices.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 3099 people, of which 58% are based in the U.S. and the remainder in India and Canada. We also engaged approximately 526 contractors and consultants as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our research and development team was comprised of approximately 994 employees, including product management and engineering personnel, which represents approximately 32% of our global employee base, and 366 sales and marketing employees, which represents approximately 12% of our global employee base. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We have high employee engagement and consider our current relationship with our employees to be good.
Expanded Support During the COVID-19 Pandemic
In light of extraordinary circumstances under the COVID-19 pandemic, we have created new resources for our employees in order to assist with the transition to a remote work environment. The health and safety of our employees is of utmost priority. The majority of our employees have the opportunity to work remotely. We have also invested in several programs designed to promote employee well-being and ensure that our employees are as effective at home as they would be in our offices worldwide. These include additional wellness benefits, additional time-off opportunities, and special reimbursements and stipends designed to support our employees and their families.
We developed an internal core team consisting of members of the Talent, IT, Legal and Facilities organizations to monitor the federal, state and local guidelines impacting our employees and ensured all recommended health and safety requirements were met, including signage, masking and distancing. We established self reporting protocols for those coming into the office and provided immediate response to those needing assistance of facing potential exposure. In addition, we provided access to needed equipment for home/remote offices including chairs, monitors, keyboards and other requested equipment. We have announced an on-going remote and hybrid work option for our employees.
Talent and Career Development
We are a global, inclusive organization with an increasingly international footprint. As we continue to grow in new markets, we anticipate continuing to recruit in new geographies. We are recognized as a company where employees can develop their careers. We measure our employee satisfaction quarterly through our Pulse Survey. The quarterly Pulse Survey is part of our Employee Journey strategy to provide our employees with more opportunities to share their thoughts and recommendations as to ways to improve the employee experience. This Pulse survey allows our employees to tell us what they enjoy about their employee experience, mention areas where we may be able to improve and confirm engagement. We partner with our employees via skip level meetings, talent connects and stay interviews as a means to retain and develop our team.
We believe in empowering employees so that they can do the work of their lives: we want everyone to be able do challenging and meaningful work in an environment where each employee can be heard, exchange ideas openly, learn new skills and build lasting relationships. We offer a number of resources to eligible employees to help engage and develop our employees including access to an extensive library of courses, webinars and instructor led training focused on professional, technical and personal development, internal career development opportunities within and outside of the employee’s current organization, project experience, a formal mentor program and education assistance for eligible employees.
Compensation and Benefits Programs
Our compensation programs are designed to recruit, reward and retain talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business, contribute to our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with competitive compensation packages that include base salary, bonus or commission plan and equity awards tied to the value of our stock price. We also provide a range of health, savings, retirement, time-off and wellness benefits for our employees, which vary based on local regulations and norms.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DE&I”)
We believe that having diverse teams working in an inclusive environment will help us achieve better business results across product innovation, customer experience and employee success. We are committed to building an inclusive workforce and workplace for all PowerSchoolers, founded on the importance of feeling connected with a sense of belonging and ally ship. Together, we can bring positive influence and joy, through passion and teamwork. At PowerSchool, we are united, with curiosity and passion, to celebrate, support and encourage a diverse and inclusive workforce.
We are proud of our eight (and growing) Employee Resource Groups which are employee led groups formed around common interests, common bonds or similar backgrounds, such as gender, ethnicity, or affiliation, with a common goal, acting together for a specific purpose. PowerSchool aims to foster a positive environment by supporting the diversity of our workforce and creating inclusive groups that can continue to support and advocate for employees from a multitude of backgrounds.
Our Fusion team leads our DE&I efforts with a mission to create energy and connectivity. As the fusion of atoms form energy, PowerSchool’s Fusion team helps to unite our employees together with curiosity and passion to celebrate, support, and encourage an inclusive and diverse workforce. 
Our Executive Leadership, Fusion, and Talent teams along with our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are critical stakeholders in creating and driving our DE&I strategy. The role of our Executive Leadership Team (“ELT”) is to create meaningful DE&I goals and hold themselves and their teams accountable for accomplishing these goals, incorporate DE&I goals into strategic planning, and support DE&I initiatives, including providing Executive Sponsorship for ERGs and their initiatives. Our Fusion team develops PowerSchool’s DE&I strategy aligned with ELT goals and works with ERGs to ensure their strategies also align. The Fusion team champions the engagement and retention of under-represented and marginalized identities. PowerSchool’s ERGs foster community and support a culture of belonging for our diverse workforce while working with the Fusion team and ELT to identify opportunity areas to further our DE&I strategy. Our ERGs connect PowerSchool to our external community through social impact work and engagement. Our Talent teams comprised of Talent Acquistion, Development, and Management are critical stakeholders in driving our DE&I strategy including partnering with diverse recruiting sources, ensuring our Employer Branding Strategy aligns with PowerSchool’s DE&I mission, and that our postings and candidate experience fosters a sense of belonging, diversity, and inclusion. They also provide DE&I-focused training paths for our employees, report progress of department and company DE&I goals and identify areas of opportunity for ELT and Fusion.
