Item 1. Business
Publix Super Markets, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the Company) are in the business of operating retail food supermarkets in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. The Company was founded in 1930 and later merged into another corporation that was originally incorporated in 1921. The Company has no other significant lines of business or industry segments.
Merchandising and manufacturing
The Company sells grocery (including dairy, produce, floral, deli, bakery, meat and seafood), health and beauty care, general merchandise, pharmacy and other products and services. The percentage of consolidated sales by merchandise category for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Grocery | 84 | % | | 84 | % | 84 | %
Other | 16 | % | | 16 | % | 16 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

The Company’s lines of merchandise include a variety of nationally advertised and private label brands as well as unbranded products such as produce, meat and seafood. The Company receives the food and nonfood products it distributes from many sources. These products are delivered to the supermarkets through Company distribution centers or directly from the suppliers and are generally available in sufficient quantities to enable the Company to satisfy its customers. The Company believes that its sources of supply of these products and raw materials used in manufacturing are adequate for its needs and that it is not dependent upon a single supplier or relatively few suppliers. Approximately 77% of the total cost of products purchased is delivered to the supermarkets through the Company’s distribution centers. Private label items are produced in the Company’s dairy, bakery and deli manufacturing facilities or are manufactured for the Company by suppliers. The Company has experienced no significant changes in the kinds of products sold or in its methods of distribution since the beginning of the fiscal year.
Store operations
The Company operated 1,211 supermarkets at the end of 2018, compared with 1,167 at the beginning of the year. In 2018, 51 supermarkets were opened (including eight replacement supermarkets) and 146 supermarkets were remodeled. Seven supermarkets were closed during the period. The replacement supermarkets that opened in 2018 replaced one supermarket closed in 2018 and seven supermarkets closed in 2017. Three of the remaining supermarkets closed in 2018 will be replaced on site in subsequent periods and three supermarkets will not be replaced. New supermarkets added 2.1 million square feet in 2018, an increase of 3.9%. At the end of 2018, the Company had 798 supermarkets located in Florida, 186 in Georgia, 71 in Alabama, 59 in South Carolina, 44 in Tennessee, 41 in North Carolina and 12 in Virginia. Also, at the end of 2018, the Company had eight supermarkets under construction in Florida, four in Alabama, three in South Carolina, three in Virginia, two in Tennessee, two in North Carolina and one in Georgia.
Competition
The Company is engaged in the highly competitive retail food industry. The Company’s competitors include traditional supermarkets, such as national and regional supermarket chains and independent supermarkets, as well as nontraditional competitors, such as supercenters, membership warehouse clubs, mass merchandisers, dollar stores, drug stores, specialty food stores, restaurants, convenience stores and online retailers. The Company’s ability to attract and retain customers is based primarily on quality of goods and service, price, convenience, product mix and store location.  
Working capital
The Company’s working capital at the end of 2018 consisted of $3,814.2 million in current assets and $3,009.6 million in current liabilities. Normal operating fluctuations in these balances can result in changes to cash flows from operating activities presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows that are not necessarily indicative of long-term operating trends. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items.
Seasonality
The historical influx of winter residents to Florida and increased purchases of products during the traditional Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter holidays typically result in seasonal sales increases from November to April of each year.

Employees
