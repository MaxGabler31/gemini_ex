Item 1. Business
General
Luther Burbank Corporation is a bank holding company incorporated on May 14, 1991 under the laws of the state of California and is headquartered in Santa Rosa, California. The Company operates primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Luther Burbank Savings, a California banking corporation originally chartered in 1983 in Santa Rosa, California. The Bank conducts its business from its headquarters in Manhattan Beach, CA. In December 2017, in conjunction with our initial public offering ("IPO"), the Company terminated its status as an S-Corporation and elected to be treated as a C-Corporation. As of December 1, 2017, the Company's taxable earnings have been subject to U.S. federal income tax. 
The Company also owns Burbank Financial Inc., a real estate investment company, and Luther Burbank Statutory Trusts I and II, entities created to issue trust preferred securities.
The Company's principal business is attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds in a variety of loans, including permanent mortgage loans and construction loans secured by residential, multifamily, and commercial real estate. The Company specializes in real estate secured lending in metropolitan areas along the West Coast and has developed expertise in multifamily residential, jumbo nonconforming single family residential and commercial real estate lending.
Our Initial Public Offering
Our IPO closed on December 12, 2017 and a total of 13,972,500 shares of common stock were sold at $10.75 per share, including 1,822,500 shares of common stock subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option, which was exercised in full. After deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, the Company received total net proceeds of $138.3 million from the initial public offering and the exercise of the underwriter option. Upon completion of the IPO, the Company became a publicly traded company with our common stock listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “LBC."
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an ‘‘emerging growth company’’ under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act"). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to other public companies. Among other factors, as an emerging growth company:

• | we may present less than five years of selected financial data;


• | we are exempt from the requirement to provide an opinion from our auditors on the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;


• | we may choose not to comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB");


• | we are permitted to provide less extensive disclosure regarding our executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies, which means we do not have to include a compensation discussion and analysis and other disclosure regarding our executive compensation in this Annual Report; and


• | we are not required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.

We can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for adopting any new or revised accounting standards. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we may adopt the standard for the private company.
We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years from the date of our IPO unless we earlier cease to qualify as an emerging growth company. We will cease to qualify as an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual gross revenues, as that amount may be periodically adjusted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we become a ‘‘large accelerated filer,’’ including having more than $700.0 million in market value 
4

of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in a three-year period. 
We expect to take advantage of the reduced reporting and other requirements of the JOBS Act with respect to the periodic reports we will file with the SEC and proxy statements that we use to solicit proxies from our shareholders.
Business Strategies
We intend to continue executing our strategic plan by focusing on the following key objectives:

• | Continued organic lending growth in our existing markets and in new strategically targeted markets. Our primary focus is to grow our client base within our strategic markets and to expand the penetration of our existing multifamily, single family and commercial real estate lending activities into additional contiguous markets on the West Coast which have strong job growth, strong economic growth and limited affordable housing. As part of these efforts, we extended our multifamily and our single family residential lending operations to Portland, Oregon. We intend to incorporate all major metropolitan markets between our existing markets, resulting in a contiguous footprint from Seattle to San Diego. The high cost of living and high barriers to entry make these markets attractive targets for investments in affordable rental housing for low and middle income tenants. Robust job markets, strong single family residential demand, high average housing costs, and concentrations of professional, highly skilled and high income workers, entrepreneurs and other high net worth individuals make our markets ideal for our portfolio single family residential lending activities. 

We believe we have a competitive advantage over larger national financial institutions, which lack our level of personalized service, and over smaller community banks, which lack our product and market expertise. We intend to capture additional market share by deepening our relationships with current customers and supporting our bankers in their pursuit of new customers in our target markets. We believe that our stable, income producing property focus and our existing customer profile lends itself to expanded lending in our existing markets.

• | Deepen client relationships and grow our deposit base. We provide a high level of customer service to our depositors. Our historical focus for our deposit production activities was exclusively on individual savings deposits from high net worth, primarily self-employed individuals, entrepreneurs and professionals, and we did not emphasize transactional accounts. This strategy has produced a stable customer base. We have recently expanded our focus, and invested in personnel, business and compliance processes and technology that enable us to acquire, and efficiently and effectively serve, a wide array of business deposit accounts, and increase outreach in high-density, small to medium sized business markets where the Bank already operates while continuing to provide the level of customer service for which we are known to our consumer depositors. We also provide comprehensive online and mobile banking products to our business and consumer depositors to complement our branch network. 

We believe that our current customer base contains significant, untapped cross-selling opportunities. We plan to continue to grow our non-brokered, consumer and business deposits by:

• | cross-selling business deposit relationships to our existing consumer customers who are business operators;


• | cross-selling business and consumer accounts to our multifamily and single family loan borrowers;


• | obtaining new individual and business customers, including specialty deposit customers, such as escrow and title company depositors,1031 exchange companies and unions; and


• | establishing new branches in key markets on the West Coast.

We will also seek to cross-sell existing customers, and solicit new ones, for additional lending opportunities in our markets, and to develop niche verticals, where our credit underwriting expertise and efficient operations can yield an attractive risk-adjusted return. Our cross-selling efforts to existing customers will be strategically targeted, based on our in depth analyses of our customers’ overall financial profile, cash flows, financial resources and banking requirements. 

• | Disciplined credit quality and robust risk management. We are committed to being a high performing

5

organization, and as we continue to grow our loan portfolio, we will do so in a disciplined manner. Risk management is a core competency of our business, demonstrated by the strong credit performance of our portfolio. We have comprehensive policies and procedures for credit underwriting, monitoring our loan portfolio and internal risk management including managing our interest rate risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, legal risk and other risks inherent in our operations. The sound credit practices followed by our bankers allow credit decisions to be made efficiently and consistently. We attribute our success to a strong credit culture, the continuous evaluation of risk and return and the strict separation between business development and credit decision making, coupled with a robust risk management framework. Our focus on credit and risk management has enabled us to grow our balance sheet successfully while maintaining strong asset quality.

• | Disciplined cost management. We intend to continue to foster a culture of efficiency through hands-on management, prudent expense management, and a small number of large deposit balance branches. We believe that we can support continued growth in assets, customers and our geographic footprint without significant additional investment in our infrastructure and technology, or significant expansion of our personnel. We believe that our existing network of branches and loan production offices, as well as nonbranch and online customer and deposit development activities, have significant potential to continue to grow loan and deposit balances. While we intend to continue to explore opportunities for establishing additional strategically located branches in markets which present significant opportunity for multifamily and commercial real estate lending, single family residential lending, and high net worth consumer and business banking relationships, including potential branches in the counties of Los Angeles, Orange and/or San Diego, California, we will continue to be highly selective in our branching decisions.

Market Area
Our operations are currently concentrated in demographically desirable and fast growing major metropolitan areas on the West Coast. We currently operate in California, Washington and Oregon from our nine full service branches in California located in Sonoma, Marin, Santa Clara, and Los Angeles Counties and one full service branch in Washington located in King County. We also operate seven loan production offices located throughout California, as well as a loan production office in Clackamas County, Oregon. We are most active in the following metropolitan areas: Santa Rosa (Sonoma County), Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, and Seattle. We are seeking to more deeply penetrate these core markets and to increase our presence in contiguous metropolitan markets that share key demographic characteristics with our existing markets, solidifying our Seattle to San Diego footprint. 
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry and in highly competitive markets throughout the West Coast. While our commercial real estate and jumbo single family residential focuses require significant expertise to perform efficiently, competition in commercial real estate lending is keen from large banking institutions with national operations, and mid-sized regional banking institutions, while in the single family lending market, we face competition from a wide array of institutions. We compete with other community banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, as well as other kinds of financial institutions and enterprises, such as securities firms, insurance companies, private lenders and nontraditional competitors such as fintech companies and internet-based lenders, depositories and payment systems. The primary factors driving competition for deposits are customer service, interest rates, fees charged, branch locations and hours, online and mobile banking functionality, and the range of products offered. The primary factors driving competition for our lending products are customer service, range of products offered, price, reputation, and quality of execution. We believe the Bank is a strong competitor in our markets; however, other competitors have advantages over us. Among the advantages that many of these large institutions have over the Bank are their abilities to finance extensive advertising campaigns, maintain extensive branch networks, make larger technology investments and to offer services which we do not offer. The higher capitalization of the larger institutions permits them to provide higher lending limits than we can, although our current lending limit is able to accommodate the credit needs of most of our borrowers. Some of these competitors have other advantages, such as tax exemption in the case of credit unions, and to some extent, lesser regulation in the case of mortgage companies and finance companies.
Our primary multifamily competitor is JPMorgan Chase & Co. Additional competitors include Opus Bank, First Foundation, Inc., Banc of California and Umpqua Bank. Our primary single family lending competitors in our markets are MUFG Union Bank, N.A., Fremont Bank, Bank of California, Washington Federal, various non-bank mortgage lenders, and large national banks. Our primary deposit competitors are First Republic Bank and large national banks.

Lending Activities
The primary components of our loan portfolio are multifamily and commercial real estate loans and single family residential loans, primarily jumbo loans which do not meet the requirements for conforming loans.

• | Multifamily and Commercial Real Estate Lending.

Our commercial real estate loans consist primarily of first mortgage loans made for the purpose of purchase, refinance or build-out of tenant improvements on investor owned multifamily residential (five or more units) properties. We also provide loans for the purchase, refinance or improvement of office, retail and light industrial properties. 
Our underwriting guidelines for multifamily and other commercial real estate loans require a thorough analysis of the financial performance, cash flows, loan to value and debt service coverage ratios, as well as the physical characteristics, of the property being financed and which will stand as collateral for the loan, as well as the financial condition and global cash flows of the borrower and any guarantor or other secondary source of repayment. We also closely review the experience of the borrower and its principals in the ownership, successful management and financing of multifamily residential rental properties or other rental commercial real estate, as well as their reputation for quality business practices and financial responsibility.
The location of the property is a primary factor in the Bank’s multifamily lending. We focus on markets with a high barrier to entry for new development, where there is a limited supply of new housing and where there is a high variance between the cost to rent and the cost to own. Our core lending areas are currently defined as:

• | Alameda, Contra Costa, Los Angeles, Marin, Napa, Orange, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Sonoma and Ventura counties in California;


• | Clark, King, Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish counties in Washington; and


• | Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington counties in Oregon.

Our extended core lending areas are currently defined as:

• | El Dorado, Monterey, Placer, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa Cruz and Solano counties in California;


• | Spokane and Thurston counties in Washington; and


• | Lane and Marion counties in Oregon.

We may re-evaluate and revise the definitions of our core and extended core areas from time to time. Non-core markets include all markets in California, Oregon or Washington not categorized as core or extended core.
We make multifamily loans on a recourse or nonrecourse basis. We may require borrowers to provide personal guarantees in a variety of circumstances, including where a borrower lacks sufficient property ownership and management experience, or where specific loan characteristics do not meet our stringent underwriting criteria, including but not limited to loans with higher loan to value ratios or lower debt service coverage ratios. Loans on other commercial real estate are generally made on a comparable basis.
Our multifamily loans typically have a 30-year term, while our nonresidential commercial property loans have a 30-year amortization period, and are typically due in ten years. For commercial real estate, we offer adjustable rate loans based on LIBOR or the 12-month Treasury average indices, with an adjustable rate, 5-year hybrid product being our most common multifamily loan product type. We seek to have interest rates on all of our commercial loans adjust or reprice no later than seven years after origination, and quarterly or semi-annually thereafter, but our ability to obtain this term is subject to the effects of market competition, customer preferences and other factors beyond our control.
Our multifamily loans and other commercial real estate loans are currently primarily originated on a retail basis, through the marketing efforts of our lending officers and loan production offices. Prior to 2015, these loans were originated primarily on a wholesale basis, through a network of brokers. We intend to maintain a balance of both retail and wholesale loan originations as we expand into additional markets, and to tailor our approach to origination of loans in each market to the characteristics of the particular market. While our multifamily and 
7

other commercial real estate loans are generally held in portfolio, we may at times sell pools of loans as a means of managing our loan product concentrations, liquidity position, capital levels and/or interest rate risk.

• | Single Family Residential Lending.

Our single family residential lending provides loans for the purchase or refinance of 1-4 family residential properties. The financed properties may be owner-occupied, or investor owned, and may be a primary residence, a second home or vacation property, or an investment property.
We currently originate substantially all of our single family residential loans through a network of wholesale brokers. We monitor and regularly review our broker relationships for regulatory compliance, integrity, competence, level of activity and profitability. The primary products offered are 3, 5, and 7-year variable rate hybrid loans, as well as the Grow and Daisy loan products described below. From 2013 until the first quarter of 2017, we originated single family residential mortgage loans on a retail basis. Through this discontinued retail channel, we offered a full range of mortgage products, including 30-year fixed rate products in addition to our portfolio hybrid products. We also brokered loans for other financial institutions, which allowed us to offer additional products. Variable rate loan production was generally held in our loan portfolio while the long-term fixed loan originations were sold to correspondents or to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"). Direct sales to Freddie Mac, on a servicing retained basis, began in late 2016.
The markets in which we make single family residential loans are the same core and extended core markets in which we make multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans. These areas are characterized by robust job markets, strong single family residential demand, high average housing cost, and concentrations of professional, highly skilled and high income workers, entrepreneurs and other high net worth individuals. These characteristics provide a strong market for our jumbo mortgage products. These loans are underwritten to our financial parameters of loan to value and debt to income ratios. Our underwriting includes a thorough analysis of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, based on reviews of information regarding the borrower’s income, cash flow and wealth. This analysis enables us to provide loans to professionals, business owners and entrepreneurs who may not have a constant, readily documentable earnings stream, but substantial assets, income and wealth. Our platform and niche lending offerings are designed to meet the needs of the high demand, low supply residential real estate market in high cost market areas, and are focused on delivering consistent certainty of execution. Our single family residential loans are generally held in portfolio, although we reserve the right to sell any loan at any time.

• | Grow and Daisy.

We also offer innovative mortgage products, including a portfolio 30-year fixed rate first mortgage and a forgivable second mortgage, to low- and moderate-income borrowers designed to make home ownership possible and affordable even in our high cost markets. Our ‘‘Grow’’ program is designed as a conventional, community lending mortgage, up to the conforming loan amount, that offers underwriting flexibility to borrowers who have income of 140% or less of the area median income and meet other financial qualifications. Properties financed under the Grow program must be located in a low- or moderate- income census tract if the borrower’s income is 80% or more of the area’s median income. Loans in this program are 30-year fixed rate mortgages made on owner-occupied single family (one and two unit) properties, including condominiums, to entry level buyers. Pricing on this product is competitive at market rate. 
In conjunction with the Grow program, we also offer a down payment and closing cost assistance product, called ‘‘Daisy.’’ Under the Daisy program, eligible borrowers may take advantage of our second lien loan that provides up to two percent of the purchase price with an additional one percent for non-recurring closing costs to assist first time homebuyers when utilizing Grow, our first lien program. The loan has a term of 36 months with no payment required during the term of the Daisy loan. Daisy loans are not recorded as assets, but are instead expensed upon origination given their fully forgivable nature.
Loans under the Grow and Daisy programs help meet compelling needs in our communities, but may be associated with higher loan to value and combined loan to value ratios when compared to standard portfolio products.

Investment Activities
Our investment securities portfolio is primarily maintained as an on-balance sheet contingent source of liquidity. It provides additional interest income and has limited interest rate risk and credit risk. Other than certain securities purchased for CRA purposes, we generally classify all of our investment securities as available-for-sale. Our investment policy authorizes investment primarily in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Agency mortgage and loan backed securities and certain CRA qualifying investments. For purposes of our investment policy, U.S. Agencies are the Small Business Administration ("SBA"), the National Credit Union Administration ("NCUA"), the Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA"), Freddie Mac, the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation. Securities issued by the SBA, NCUA and GNMA are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government.
Funding Activities
Deposits.
We offer a wide array of deposit products for individuals and businesses, including interest and noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, certificates of deposit ("CD") and money market accounts. We provide a high level of customer service to our depositors. As a means of supplementing our strategically limited branch network, we offer our customers unlimited free access to ATM machines worldwide. Our strategy has produced a stable customer and depositor base. We have invested in personnel, business and compliance processes and technology that enable us to acquire, and efficiently and effectively serve, a wide array of business deposit accounts, while continuing to provide the level of customer service for which we are known.
Our deposits are currently acquired primarily through our branch network on a retail basis from high net worth individuals, professionals and their businesses, who value our financial strength, stability and high level of service. We have expanded our focus to leverage our relationships and serve business and individuals with a broader array of deposit and cash management products.
We currently offer a comprehensive range of business deposit products and services to assist with the banking needs of our business customers, from a basic reserve account (savings and CD products) to integrated operating accounts with cash management capacity. Our online banking platform allows a customer to view balances, initiate payments, pay bills (including Positive Pay) and set up custom alerts/statements. Online wires, ACH and remote capture are additional payment options available to qualified businesses. Our debit cards allow access to cash nationwide as a result of our membership in major ATM networks. We also provide online and mobile banking products to our consumer depositors, to complement our branch network.
We plan to continue to grow our deposits by cross-selling business deposit relationships to our existing consumer customers who are business owners, and consumer and business accounts to our multifamily and single family loan borrowers, through selective establishment of new branches in key markets on the West Coast, and by obtaining new individual and business customers, including specialty deposit customers, such as escrow and title company depositors, 1031 exchange companies and unions. Our cross-selling efforts to existing customers will be strategically targeted, based on our in depth analyses of our customers’ overall financial situation, global cash flows, financial resources and banking requirements. Our cross-selling efforts are in their very early stages, and we believe there is a significant capacity to expand deposit and lending relationships on this basis.
We supplement customer deposits with wholesale, or brokered, deposits where necessary to fund loan demand prior to raising additional customer deposits, or where desirable from a cost or liability maturity standpoint. Our current policy limits the use of wholesale deposits in accordance with our risk appetite level as determined by our board of directors.
Borrowings.
We supplement the funding provided by our deposit accounts with other borrowings at the Bank level from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco ("FHLB") to enable us to fund loans and to meet liquidity needs. We also maintain a line of credit at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ("FRB") Discount Window, which is generally not used but provides an additional source of funding, if necessary. The use of FHLB borrowings can vary significantly from period to period, as the ability to originate loans frequently outpaces the ability to obtain core deposits at acceptable rates and in comparable amounts.

Risk Management
We believe that effective risk management is of primary importance. Risk management refers to the activities by which we identify, measure, monitor, evaluate and manage the risks we face in the course of our banking activities. These include liquidity, interest rate, credit, operational, compliance, regulatory, strategic, financial and reputational risk exposures. Our board of directors and management team have created a risk-conscious culture that is focused on quality growth, which starts with capable and experienced risk management teams and infrastructure capable of addressing the evolving risks we face, as well as the changing regulatory and compliance landscape. Our risk management approach employs comprehensive policies and processes to establish robust governance and emphasizes personal ownership and accountability for risk with all our employees. We believe a disciplined and conservative underwriting approach has been the key to our strong asset quality.
Our board of directors sets the tone at the top of our organization, adopting and overseeing the implementation of our Bank’s risk management framework, which establishes our overall risk appetite and risk management strategy. The board of directors approves our Risk Appetite Statement, which includes risk policies, procedures, limits, targets and reporting structured to guide decisions regarding the appropriate balance between risk and return considerations in our business. Our board of directors receives periodic reporting on the risks and control environment effectiveness and monitors risk levels in relation to the approved risk appetite. The Audit & Risk Committee of our board of directors provides oversight of all enterprise risk management. The Executive Committee of management is charged with identifying, managing and controlling key risks that threaten our ability to achieve our strategic initiatives and goals.
Credit risk is the risk that borrowers or counterparties will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations in accordance with the underlying contractual terms and the risk that credit assets will suffer significant deterioration in market value. We manage and control credit risk in our loan portfolio by adhering to well-defined underwriting criteria and account administration standards established by management and approved by the board of directors. Written credit policies document underwriting standards, approval levels, exposure limits and other limits or standards deemed necessary and prudent. Portfolio diversification at the obligor, product and geographic levels is actively managed to mitigate concentration risk. In addition, credit risk management includes an independent credit review process that assesses compliance with commercial real estate and consumer credit policies, risk rating standards and other critical credit information. In addition to implementing risk management practices that are based upon established and sound lending practices, we adhere to sound credit principles. We understand and evaluate our customers’ borrowing needs and capacity to repay, in conjunction with their character and history. The Bank’s Credit Council, which includes our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Credit Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for ensuring that the Bank has an effective credit risk management program and credit risk rating system, adheres to our board’s Risk Appetite Statement, and maintains an adequate allowance for loan losses. Our management and board of directors place significant focus on maintaining a healthy risk profile and ensuring sustainable growth. Our risk appetite seeks to balance the risks necessary to achieve our strategic goals while ensuring that our risks are appropriately managed and remain within our defined limits.
Our management of interest rate and liquidity risk is overseen by our Asset and Liability Council, which is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, based on a risk management infrastructure approved by our board of directors that outlines reporting and measurement requirements. In particular, this infrastructure reviews financial performance, trends, and significant variances to budget; reviews and recommends for board approval risk limits and tolerances; reviews ongoing monitoring and reporting regarding our performance with respect to these areas of risk, including compliance with board-approved risk limits and stress-testing; reviews and recommends to the Executive Committee for approval any changes to theories, mathematics, methodologies, assumptions, and data output for models used to measure these risks; ensures annual back-testing and independent validation of models at a frequency commensurate with risk level; reviews all hedging strategies and recommends changes as appropriate; reviews and recommends our contingency funding plan; recommends to the Executive Committee proposed wholesale borrowing limits to be submitted to the board of directors or its designated committee; recommends to the Executive Committee the proposed terms of any unanticipated long-term borrowing arrangement prior to debt issuance; develops recommended capital requirements; and acts as a second line of defense in reviewing information and reports submitted to the council for the purpose of identifying, investigating, and assuring remediation, to its satisfaction, of errors or irregularities, if any.
