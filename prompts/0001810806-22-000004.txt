Item 1. Business
Unity is the world’s leading platform for creating and operating interactive, RT3D content. Creators, ranging from game developers to artists, architects, and automotive designers to filmmakers and more, use Unity to make their imaginations come to life. The Unity platform provides a comprehensive set of software solutions to create and operate real-time 2D and 3D content for multiple platforms, including mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles, and augmented and virtual reality devices.
The content built on the Unity platform offers users a fundamentally more engaging and immersive experience than traditional static content, regardless of industry or purpose. This is because content made with Unity is:
•interactive, allowing end-users to connect with the content and with one another;
•real-time, so it can instantly reflect data and adapt to end-user behavior and feedback; and
•immersive, because graphics have 3D shape and depth, permitting multiple viewing angles, and enabling augmented and virtual reality.
Our platform provides a comprehensive set of software solutions to create and fully operate real-time 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles, and augmented and virtual reality devices. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we had on average, approximately 3.9 billion monthly active end users who consumed content created or operated with our solutions. The applications developed by these creators were downloaded, on average, five billion times per month in 2021.
Unity has built its reputation in gaming, and our scale and reach in this industry are significant. We estimate that in the fourth quarter of 2021, we increased our mobile market share with more of the top 1,000 mobile games made with Unity. Unity’s platform helps game developers—from the largest publishers in the world with teams of hundreds, to mid-sized, small, and independent publishers, to individual creators—build and operate high quality games, rapidly and efficiently. Unity games can be built once and deployed and operated across more than 20 platforms, including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and the leading augmented and virtual reality platforms, among others. As gaming has proliferated, the business models for content have evolved beyond one-time purchases to include advertising and in-app purchases. Unity enables these new business models by providing creators with the solutions they need to easily run and monetize their content.
What's more, the dramatic growth in the demand for interactive content is driving industries beyond gaming to embrace the advantages of RT3D content. Creators in many different industries are leveraging our platform to provide faster content creation and efficient deployment across formats and use cases. Today, Fortune 500 companies in industries such as architecture, engineering, construction, automotive, transportation, manufacturing, film, television, and retail use Unity for many new use cases, including automobile and building design, online and augmented reality product configurators, autonomous driving simulation, and augmented reality workplace safety training. These new forms of content are emerging parts of our business and represent a significant opportunity for growth.
The Unity platform consists of two distinct, but connected and synergistic, sets of solutions. Our Create Solutions are used by content creators—developers, artists, designers, engineers, and architects—to create high-definition, real-time 2D and 3D content. Our Operate Solutions offer customers the ability to grow and engage their end-user base, as well as run and monetize their content with the goal of optimizing end-user acquisition and operational costs while increasing the lifetime value of their end-users.
We offer our Create Solutions primarily through monthly subscriptions and our Operate Solutions primarily through revenue-share and consumption-based models. This allows us to generate revenue from our customers as they develop content and also as they succeed and grow. Subscriptions for our Create Solutions drive adoption of our Operate Solutions.

Unity Software Inc.

Over the years, we have experienced rapid growth. Our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $1.1 billion, $772.4 million, and $541.8 million, representing year-over-year growth of 44%, 43%, and 42%, respectively. We generated net losses of $532.6 million, $282.3 million, and $163.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, which included $347.2 million, $134.6 million, and $44.5 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense.
Our Platform
Unity is a content creation and operating platform made up of two complementary and interconnected solutions: Create Solutions and Operate Solutions. Used together, our customers can create, run, and monetize their content across a broad range of third-party content distribution platforms.
Create Solutions
Our Create Solutions are a robust set of tools for the development of high-definition, real-time 2D and 3D content. Designed with creators in mind, the tools are used by artists, designers, and developers across a range of industries ranging from games to aerospace, medical to manufacturing, and beyond. Create Solutions includes our custom scripting tools and a high-definition render pipeline; graphics, animation, and audio tools; navigation, networking, user interface tools; and more. Delivered as a modular application architecture, creators can leverage our products and extensibility to easily edit, run, and iterate interactive, RT3D and 2D experiences that can be created once and deployed to more than 20 platforms including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and the leading augmented and virtual reality platforms, among others.
The editor, Unity’s flagship product, is accessible on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems and enables creators to drag and drop content, such as images, textures, 3D meshes, and sounds, into a virtual workspace. From there, creators can configure content and compose it into scenes of objects, such as three-dimensional characters, buildings, automobiles, or landscapes. Additionally, a large variety of components can be added to the objects to make the content dynamic and interactive. Unity physics is an example of a component, which, when added to an object in our editor, causes the object to behave as it would in the real world, subject to the forces of friction and gravity. Other components may add animation, photo-realistic textures, or movement to the object.
Once the creation of a game or other application is completed in the editor and the creator wants to deploy content, our platform compiles all of the application’s components around the Unity runtime. The Unity runtime is a critical part of a Unity application that allows content created on our platform to be interactively rendered in real-time on end-user devices. Content created in our editor can be easily deployed to a variety of platforms using our runtime, limiting the need for creators to invest in proprietary development technology around each and every platform.
Building off this foundational technology opens a broad, wide-ranging opportunity to make the Unity platform a utility in content creation. To achieve this, Unity outlined three primary strategies in 2021 to make and democratize real-time, interactive content:
•Expand into cloud-based tools and services: Unity believes that continuing to be the toolchain for delivering high-quality, interactive, games, and RT3D experiences across most devices will be most successful with a move towards the cloud. This is to support the significant shifts in enterprise business models, and the need to make tools more easily accessible to all. To start, Unity brought on remote access platform Parsec Cloud, Inc. ("Parsec") and SyncSketch LLC ("SyncSketch"), which enables cloud-based, secure collaboration between creators and artists.

Unity Software Inc.

•Deliver key tools to professional 3D artists: In addition to the game developers and 3D creators, Unity deems it critical to provide cloud-based tools for professional artists and consumer creators, thereby enabling an entirely new generation of creators to build, transform, and distribute RT3D content. In 2021, Unity brought on the tools and technologies from Weta Digital Limited ("Weta Digital"), Interactive Data Visualization (makers of SpeedTree) and Ziva Dynamics Inc. ("Ziva Dynamics"), three highly-strategic acquisitions to democratize access to some of artistry's most exclusive tools and services.
•Link the physical and digital world: Unity customers across all industries are leaning on the output of virtual replication and simulation to better understand business initiatives, products and even market trends. Known as "digital twins", Unity is focused on bringing the power of RT3D into these customers’ digital strategies to provide a more robust, 360-view of what’s possible in a virtual landscape. To date, Unity is working with Hyundai Motors to connect a physical factory with its digital twin to enhance plant management, drive productivity and innovate in the manufacturing process. And eBay has partnered with Unity to enable sellers to showcase the actual item they are selling in Unity’s proprietary, interactive 360-view.
Operate Solutions
Our Operate Solutions offer customers the ability to grow and engage their user bases, and to run and monetize their content—from 2D puzzle games to multiplayer, multi-platform games, or other 3D interactive content—irrespective of whether the content was created in Unity.
Unity Gaming Services
Developers face technical challenges and unpredictable costs as they launch and run multiplayer, cross-platform games and applications spanning mobile, PC, and console platforms and game genres. Delays and downtimes are detrimental to our customers, who therefore place a high value on reliable solutions with predictable cost structures. In 2021, Unity introduced Unity Gaming Services, an improved and streamlined platform designed to allow Unity, and its customers, to drive more value from our Operate Solutions offerings. With Unity Gaming Services, we’ve simplified the way creators access and harness our solutions from our product suite that offers a common and consistent user experience. Unity Gaming Services offers simplicity in one platform, one dashboard, one login, and is available through one SDK. A few examples of products within include:
•Cloud Content Delivery: Unity’s Cloud Content Delivery is the first end-to-end service for live game updates: a content delivery network (CDN) and back-end-as-a-service (BAAS) built for game development. It optimizes the delivery of content to end-user devices, enabling applications to be smaller and therefore accessible across a larger range of devices, increasing distribution opportunities for our creators.
•Multiplay: The engine agnostic game server hosting and matchmaking platform, delivering resilience and scale to gaming infrastructure which enables the best experience for players.
•Netcode for Games Objects: A networking code foundation that developers can depend on – customizable and extensible to meet the needs of many multiplayer game types.
•Player Engagement: Allows developers to target players with specific audiences, content, and economy attributes. The latest iteration integrates A/B testing results so reporting is manifested in Unity Analytics and Data Explorer. We’ve also integrated Push Notifications which allows developers to send users push notifications based on logical conditions.
•Remote Config: Allows developers to make real-time game updates with no code changes or app updates. Easily target changes to player segments of different skill levels, spending habits, and playing styles - through targeted game updates and A/B testing.

Unity Software Inc.

•Vivox: A leading provider of voice and text communication services for multiplayer games on Console, Mobile, and PC. Whether your game is built on Unity or another game engine, Vivox can be integrated by teams of all sizes and scale to millions of players. In-game communication is a critical component of successful revenue-generating multiplayer games. In short, when players can talk to one another they stay in the game longer thereby increasing player lifetime value. Vivox is trusted by some of the biggest publishers and titles out there, including PUBG, Valorant, League of Legends, Rainbow Six, and many others.
Monetization
Many of our customers create games and applications with the purpose of building a profitable business. This requires both the acquisition of end-users at a reasonable cost and the monetization of these end-users as they engage over time with the content.
Our user acquisition products enable advertisers to efficiently acquire new end-users at scale. Our focus and strength are in pay-for-performance end-user acquisition, where advertisers pay us based on a tangible outcome or set goal, such as number of installs, rather than on a cost-per-impression basis. As a result, a large number of our advertisers have open spending limits with us as they can clearly measure the positive return on their spend.
•Personalized Advertising: an end-user acquisition product that uses machine learning combined with our deep player and game data to drive end-user installs at scale. Advertisers can define campaigns based on several parameters:
▪Reach: advertisers define the amount they are willing to pay for each install. Our algorithm maximizes reach and identifies the audience with the highest propensity to install.
▪Retention: our algorithms dynamically adjust the cost per install based on the likelihood of customer retention over 7-day, 14-day, and other retention periods. This minimizes the risk that our customers will spend to acquire end-users that are unlikely to yield attractive returns, including those that churn almost immediately.
▪Desired Return on Ad Spend ("ROAS"): our algorithms dynamically adjust the cost per install based on a combination of the ROAS target set by the advertiser and the predicted lifetime value of an end-user.
•Contextual Advertising: a product designed for cases in which our customers or their end-users opt-out of personalization within apps. With the depth and breadth of our in-game data, we can deliver highly relevant advertising while respecting stricter privacy elections.
Unity’s monetization products, Unity Ads and Unity In-App Purchases ("Unity IAP"), help developers to maximize the revenue potential of their content by enabling customers to maximize the lifetime value of their end users, while optimizing their end-user acquisition and operational costs.
•Unity Ads: enables developers to seek the highest value for each impression of their inventory, through our Unified Auction, from a broad range of advertisers including direct Unity customers as well as demand-side platforms, or DSPs. Each time an event is triggered within our customer’s application, our auction determines the best advertisement to show the end user. Customers can access Unity Ads through a software development kit that enables ad delivery, rendering, and transactions.
•Unity Mediation: Unity Mediation gives developers the tools they need to maximize the revenue from their games without sacrificing the game experience. Mediation gives access to key networks such as Unity, Meta Audience Network, ironSource, and more.
•Unity IAP: allows for the sale of virtual goods within free or paid games on all major platforms by enabling creators to create once and connect to all major platform stores (for example the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store), utilizing a convenient single integration.

New creators often start by using our free Unity Personal or Unity Student plans. We encourage continued creator engagement by providing free resources, such as creator education, Asset Store access, and enrollment into our network of Unity creators. Customers do not need to upgrade to a paid plan until they reach $100,000 in annual revenue or funding. For our Operate Solutions, we enable customers to easily get started by providing a self-service platform for our monetization solutions and free use of our Vivox product for up to 5,000 concurrent users. The majority of our Operate Solutions customers are onboarded through our self-serve platform and require minimal upfront investment to get started.
Many of our free users become champions for Unity, creating word-of-mouth advertising for our products and services. As creators engage more deeply with Unity, they often upgrade to paid plans via our website or sales teams. We support this upgrade path through targeted marketing campaigns and in-product prompts highlighting the added benefits and features of our paid plans. The significant majority of Unity’s monthly active creators are free users, and we see this as an opportunity for future growth.
Strategic Relationships
We have a robust and diverse partner ecosystem that includes leading hardware, operating system, device, game console, and other technology providers. Our partners benefit from their relationship with us through growth in engagement of our customers with their ecosystem.
Our partner ecosystem is critical to our create once and deploy anywhere value proposition to our customers and is an important part of our go-to-market strategy.

We primarily compete with other content development tools and monetization services. Most of these competitors offer point solutions that represent a subset of the offerings on our platform:
•Create Solutions: We primarily compete against proprietary game engines built in-house by large game studios, as well as Cocos2d-x (Chukong Technologies) and Unreal Engine (Epic Games), which offer game development tools primarily serving the PC games and mobile games sectors, and, in the case of Unreal Engine (Epic Games), industries beyond gaming. Outside of gaming, we also compete with other development platforms that offer 2D and 3D design products.
•Operate Solutions: With respect to our Operate Solutions, we operate in a fragmented ecosystem composed of select divisions of large, well-established companies as well as privately held companies. The large companies in our ecosystem may play multiple different roles given the breadth of their business. Examples of these large companies are Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Tencent. Most of these companies are also our partners and customers.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are:
•cross-platform deployability;
•the pace and quality of new product innovation;
•product capabilities, including flexibility, scalability, performance, security, and reliability;
•integration with existing platforms;
•high-quality customer support, training, and services;
•brand recognition and reputation;
•return on investment of sales and marketing efforts;
•volume and leverage of user data and analytics;
•price and affordability of our solutions and customer economics;
•ease of use of products; and
•ability to expand to adjacent industries.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.
Technology Infrastructure and Operations
We have built our technology infrastructure using a distributed and scalable architecture on a global scale. We designed our technology platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and to deliver high availability and low latency. Incremental backups are performed twice a day and full backups are performed daily. Backups are preserved for a time period directly proportional to the criticality of the data.
Redundant copies of content are stored in several geographically separate regions and are replicated within each region. Data is transmitted in encrypted form. We mainly use Google Cloud Platform as our processing and delivery cloud infrastructure but also have some services with other cloud infrastructure providers and some with special hardware/security requirements running on our own private data center. With respect to the Google Cloud Platform, we are party to a cloud service agreement with Google, pursuant to which we are committed to spend an aggregate of $700.0 million between September 2021 and September 2026. If we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitment during any year, we are required to pay the difference. Either we or Google may terminate the agreement if the other party is in material breach and fails to cure the breach within 30 days after receiving written notice. We expect to meet our remaining commitment under this agreement.

Unity Software Inc.

We have built a service operations infrastructure with automated, 24x7 telemetry, supported by a team to help ensure that any issues that arise with our services are addressed as quickly as possible.
Security, Privacy, and Data Protection
At Unity we understand that creative assets, performance and user data are critical to our customers’ businesses. We devote considerable resources to our security program, regularly testing the security of user assets utilized by our services, and developing easy-to-use features that content creators can leverage to enhance the security of their creative products.
Security
Our team of security practitioners, working in partnership with peers across our company, works to identify and mitigate risks, assess our security measures against industry standards and best practices, and continue to evaluate ways to improve. We focus on four core components: Application Security, Infrastructure Security, Incident Response, and Governance and Compliance. In addition to these core components, we drive a program of Responsible Disclosure to engage and gain support of the research community to identify advanced issues for remediation. Our security program is focused on expanding our documentation and audit functions in order to ready us for industry certifications that will be important for our growth in industrial and government markets.
Privacy and Data Protection
The privacy of developers and application users and the protection of the data in our ecosystem are important to Unity’s continued growth and success. We maintain a dedicated privacy team that leads a group of employees, federated throughout the organization, who serve in roles responsible for data governance and management within product groups and functional areas. We conduct privacy impact assessments and data protection impact assessments, conduct product and feature reviews, maintain a reasonably exhaustive list of data collected and processed, and provide support for data protection and privacy-related requests. Our privacy team reports progress on the program and its functions quarterly to a team of executives charged with data governance oversight, and conducts regular privacy-related training. Additionally, our Data Protection Officer periodically updates the audit committee of our board of directors on changes in laws and Unity’s compliance activities.
We are committed to complying, and helping our customers comply, with data protection laws globally. We monitor guidance from industry and regulatory bodies, meet with regulators and update our product features and contractual commitments when necessary to meet new or evolving privacy legal requirements.
We maintain a privacy policy that describes how Unity collects, uses, and discloses information, and what choices organizations and users have.
Because our business involves the collection, use, storage, and transmission of personal information, we are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and data security. Such laws may include Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 ("EU GDPR"), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom ("UK") law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ("UK GDPR"), and the European Union's ePrivacy Directive. Countries around the world have adopted or are proposing similar laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and data security, and we may become subject to them as we expand our operations into new geographic markets.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other legal and contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights.

Unity Software Inc.

As of December 31, 2021, we had 76 issued utility patents in the United States that expire between 2032 and 2041, 29 issued utility patents in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and 366 utility patent applications (including 17 provisional applications and 92 active PCT applications) pending in the United States and globally. As of December 31, 2021, we also had 22 registered design patents in non-U.S. jurisdictions and 18 active design patent applications, three of which are in the United States. While we believe our patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to our competitive position, no single patent or patent application is material to us as a whole.
We have trademark rights in our name and other brand indicia and have trademark registrations for select marks in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.unity.com and similar variations.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants, and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties in order to limit access to, disclosure, and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 5,245 full-time employees, across 54 offices and in 21 countries. We also engage contractors and consultants. We had 2,776 employees in technical roles, which accounted for 53% of our total headcount. In addition, our geographic diversification enhances our ability to retain and attract talent, and as of December 31, 2021, approximately 67% of our full-time employees were located outside of the United States.
We believe the swift growth in numbers and the strength of our culture is fueled by our commitment to our values, inclusion, and social impact, making Unity an exceptional place for top talent to work and grow.
Our Values and Commitment to Inclusion
The Unity Values capture what we represent and form the foundation of our company culture. They have a material impact on how we do our jobs and how we treat each other every day. They also guide us in making the right decisions for our customers, partners and creators. Our values are: Users First, Best Ideas Win, In It Together, and Go Bold.
•Users First: We put users first, they are the reason we do what we do. Our shared dedication to our customers holds us together, defines and aligns our work and drives us to deliver for them.
•Best Ideas Win: We believe great ideas can come from anywhere. We have vigorous debates, we listen and learn, and we make sure the best ideas win. We care enough to go through the pain of messy conversations.
•In It Together: We are Citizens of Unity. We act like owners. We’re activists; we have a voice and use it. We’re direct and candid, with good intent. We deeply collaborate towards shared goals and respect each other’s unique contributions.
•Go Bold: We do bold things. We go big and when we fail, we learn, get better and go big again. We challenge and elevate each other beyond our limits to do what may seem impossible. We stay curious and hungry.

Unity Software Inc.

We live out these values through our global framework for Inclusion, which centers on three principles: Empathy, Respect, and Opportunity. Empathy fuels connection, respect builds trust, and opportunity empowers employees. These principles cascade throughout our company and encourage us all to meet each other where we are and celebrate our differences.
•Empathy is the ability to recognize and validate the perspectives and experiences of others, even without connecting yourself to those experiences. It’s about listening to understand—not to respond.
•Respect is rooting your efforts in empathy, by taking everyday actions that acknowledge individual experiences and perspectives.
•Opportunity is demonstrating respect for the knowledge and experience of others by empowering them to contribute, create or lead based on that knowledge and experience.
We invest in our culture in many ways, including a Unity Leadership Program run by senior leaders, frequent Town Hall meetings, executive roundtables, manager and employee development opportunities, and a global Workplace Experience team dedicated to curating local cultural events including yoga, meditation, coffee talks, and game nights.
Unity’s benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of a diverse workforce. In response to COVID-19, we have enhanced the ways we help our employees care for themselves and their families through expanded mental health benefits and support for remote working. We are continuing to build on our inclusive benefit offerings and programs, led by our Inclusion and Global Benefits teams.
Our Commitment to Social Impact
We love creators—those bold enough to create what is in their imagination to change the world. Creators are change-makers and Unity is their platform for change. Since our founding, we have focused on empowering our creators and employees to make the world a better place.
In October 2020, Unity launched Unity Social Impact, a division of the business aimed at empowering employees and creators of all backgrounds to foster a more inclusive, sustainable world. Unity Social Impact consists of three pillars: Education and Economic Opportunity for All, Sustainability, and Health and Well-being. The announcement of the new division was underpinned by the establishment of the Unity Charitable Fund, a program that provides the financial mechanism to bring the goals of the Social Impact division to life. Created in partnership with Tides Foundation at the time of our initial public offering, the Unity Charitable Fund was initially issued 750,000 shares of our common stock.
Government Regulations
Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods.
