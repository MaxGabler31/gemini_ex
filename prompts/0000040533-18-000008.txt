The company grew organically and through acquisitions until the early 1990s when we sold nearly our entire portfolio except for our military-vehicle and submarine businesses. Starting in the mid-1990s, we began expanding again by acquiring Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, combat-vehicle-related businesses, IT product and service companies and additional shipyards, forming the foundation of our company today.
We continue to expand our business through organic growth and acquisitions. We focus on delivering superior products and services to our customers, and creating value for our shareholders through a relentless focus on operational excellence and continuous improvement.
Our company is organized into four business groups: Aerospace, Combat Systems, Information Systems and Technology, and Marine Systems. Each group is comprised of two or more business units. Each unit has responsibility for its strategy and operational performance, providing the flexibility needed to stay close to customers, perform on programs and remain agile. Our corporate headquarters is responsible for setting the strategic direction and governance of the company, the allocation of capital and promoting a culture of ethics and integrity that defines how we operate. Our management team delivers on our commitments to shareholders through disciplined execution of our robust backlog, efficient cash-flow conversion and prudent capital deployment. We focus on managing costs, implementing continuous improvement initiatives and collaborating across our businesses to achieve our goals of maximizing earnings and cash and driving return on invested capital.
Following is additional information on each of our business groups. Prior-period information has been restated for the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we adopted on January 1, 2017, as discussed in Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. For selected financial information, see Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
AEROSPACE
Our Aerospace group is at the forefront of the business-jet industry. We deliver a family of Gulfstream aircraft and provide a range of services for Gulfstream aircraft and aircraft produced by other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The Aerospace group is known for:

• | superior aircraft design, quality, performance, safety and reliability;


• | technologically advanced cockpit and cabin systems; and


• | industry-leading product service and support.

At Gulfstream, we design, develop, manufacture, service and support the world’s most technologically advanced business-jet aircraft. Our product line includes aircraft across a spectrum of price and performance options in the large- and mid-cabin business-jet market. The varying ranges, speeds and cabin dimensions of these aircraft are well-suited for the needs of a diverse, global customer base.
We invest in Gulfstream to introduce new products and first-to-market enhancements that broaden customer choice, improve aircraft performance and set new standards for customer safety, comfort and in-flight productivity. We created a new market with the G650 family of business jets. The G650 is the fastest non-supersonic aircraft to circumnavigate the globe, having flown westbound around the world in a record-setting 41 hours and 7 minutes. The G650 and G650ER have claimed 70 world speed records. The G650 also earned the National Aeronautic Association’s Robert J. Collier Trophy, an annual award recognizing the greatest achievement in U.S. aeronautics or astronautics with respect to improving performance, efficiency and safety. In 2017, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of the G650’s type certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and its entry into service. Today, there are more than 280 G650 and G650ER aircraft operating in 40 countries.
Our newest Gulfstream products are two clean-sheet large-cabin business jets, the G500 and G600, which exemplify our commitment to performance, safety, efficiency and innovation. The aircraft are progressing through concurrent flight-test programs in preparation for FAA certification. Five G500 test aircraft have completed more than 4,200 test hours since first flight in 2015, and five G600 aircraft have accumulated more than 1,300 test hours since first flight in 2016. Both aircraft have exceeded original expectations throughout our rigorous flight test program. In late 2017, we announced increased performance standards for both aircraft. At Mach 0.85, the G500 can fly 5,200 nautical miles, and the G600 can fly 6,500 nautical miles. The performance of these aircraft demonstrate our culture of continuous improvement and the discipline and rigor inherent in our design, development and flight-test programs.
Our product enhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics, composites, renewable fuels, flight-control systems, acoustics, cabin technologies and vision systems. One example is the Symmetry Flight Deck introduced with the G500 and G600, which includes 10 touchscreens and active control sidesticks, a first for business aviation. The touchscreens improve how pilots interact with onboard systems, and the sidesticks are digitally linked to allow both pilots to see and feel each other’s control inputs, enhancing situational awareness and further improving safety of the aircraft.
Gulfstream designs, develops and manufactures aircraft in Savannah, Georgia, including manufacturing all large-cabin models. The mid-cabin model is assembled by a non-U.S. partner. All models are outfitted in the group’s U.S. facilities. In support of Gulfstream’s growing aircraft portfolio and customer base, we continue to invest in our facilities.

We also contract with other U.S. government customers, including the intelligence community, the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, and first-responder agencies. Our revenue from the U.S. government was as follows:

Year Ended December 31 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
DoD | $ | 15,498 | | | $ | 15,139 | | | $ | 14,694
Non-DoD | 2,847 | | | 2,824 | | | 2,831 | 
Foreign Military Sales (FMS)* | 676 | | | 713 | | | 453 | 
Total U.S. government | $ | 19,021 | | | $ | 18,676 | | | $ | 17,978
% of total revenue | 61 | % | | 61 | % | | 57 | %

* In addition to our direct non-U.S. sales, we sell to non-U.S. governments through the FMS program. Under the FMS program, we contract with and are paid by the U.S. government, and the U.S. government assumes the risk of collection from the non-U.S. government customer.
Our U.S. government businesses operate under fixed-price, cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts. Our production contracts are primarily fixed-price. Under these contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount. Contracts for research, engineering, repair and maintenance, and other services are typically cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, the customer reimburses contract costs and pays a fixed, incentive or award-based fee. These fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract, such as cost, quality, schedule and performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials.

In our U.S. government business, fixed-price contracts accounted for 54% in 2017, 53% in 2016 and 55% in 2015; cost-reimbursement contracts accounted for 42% in 2017, 43% in 2016 and 41% in 2015; and time-and-materials contracts accounted for 4% in each of the past three years.
For information on the advantages and disadvantages of each of these contract types, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
U.S. COMMERCIAL
Our U.S. commercial revenue was $4.5 billion in 2017 and 2016 and $5.5 billion in 2015. This represented 15% of our consolidated revenue in 2017 and 2016 and 17% in 2015. The majority of this revenue is for business-jet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries. 
NON-U.S.
Our revenue from non-U.S. government and commercial customers was $7.5 billion in 2017, $7.4 billion in 2016 and $8.3 billion in 2015. This represented 24% of our consolidated revenue in 2017 and 2016 and 26% in 2015.
We conduct business with customers around the world. Our non-U.S. defense subsidiaries have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers, providing a broad portfolio of products and services and maintaining long-term relationships with their customers.
Our non-U.S. commercial business consists primarily of business-jet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services. The market for business-jet aircraft and related services outside North America has expanded significantly in recent years. While the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in North America, orders from non-U.S. customers represent a significant segment of our aircraft business with approximately 55% of the Aerospace group’s total backlog on December 31, 2017.
COMPETITION
Several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and business-aviation markets. While customers’ evaluation criteria vary, the principal competitive elements include:

• | the technical excellence, reliability, safety and cost competitiveness of our products and services;


• | our ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies that improve mission performance and adapt to dynamic threats;


• | successful program execution and on-time delivery of complex, integrated systems;


• | our global footprint and accessibility to customers;


• | the reputation and customer confidence derived from past performance; and


• | the successful management of customer relationships.

DEFENSE MARKET COMPETITION
The U.S. government contracts with numerous domestic and non-U.S. companies for products and services. We compete against other large platform and system-integration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability. Outside the United States, we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and state-owned defense manufacturers. Our Combat Systems group competes with a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. businesses. Our Information Systems and Technology group competes with many companies, from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise. Our Marine Systems group has one primary 
13

competitor with which it also partners on the Virginia-class submarine program. The operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully.
We are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors. Competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements. Opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program’s integrator, overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team, or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem.
BUSINESS-JET AIRCRAFT MARKET COMPETITION
The Aerospace group has several competitors for each of its Gulfstream products. Key competitive factors include aircraft safety, reliability and performance; comfort and in-flight productivity; service quality, global footprint and responsiveness; technological and new-product innovation; and price. We believe that Gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas.
The Aerospace group competes worldwide in the business-jet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of price, quality and timeliness. In our maintenance, repair and FBO businesses, the group competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies, particularly in the maintenance business. In our completions business, the group competes with several service providers.
BACKLOG
Our total backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions. For additional discussion of backlog, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.
Summary backlog information for each of our business groups follows:

 | | | | | 2017 TotalBacklog NotExpected to BeCompleted in 2018

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
To foster innovative product development and evolution, we conduct sustained R&D activities as part of our normal business operations. Most of our Aerospace group’s R&D activities support Gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs. In our U.S. defense businesses, we conduct customer-sponsored R&D activities under government contracts and company-sponsored R&D activities, investing in technologies and capabilities that provide innovative solutions for our customers. In accordance with government regulations, we recover a portion of company-sponsored R&D expenditures through overhead 
14

charges to U.S. government contracts. For more information on our company-sponsored R&D activities, including our expenditures for the past three years, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We develop technology, manufacturing processes and systems-integration practices. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to and from others. The U.S. government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of U.S. government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents. Although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business, no existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business.
EMPLOYEES
On December 31, 2017, our subsidiaries had 98,600 employees, approximately one-fifth of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives. Agreements covering approximately 2% of total employees are due to expire in 2018. Historically, we have renegotiated these labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities.
RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIERS AND SEASONALITY
We depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials, components and subsystems. Our U.S. government customer is a supplier on some of our programs. These supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints, which can put pressure on our costs. Effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance. We sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could impact our ability to meet our customer commitments. We attempt to mitigate risks with our suppliers by entering into long-term agreements and leveraging company-wide agreements to achieve economies of scale, and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts. We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.
Our business is not seasonal in nature. The receipt of contract awards, the availability of funding from the customer, the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are all factors that influence the timing of our revenue. In the United States, these factors are influenced by the federal government’s budget cycle based on its October-to-September fiscal year. 
REGULATORY MATTERS
U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
U.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) govern the majority of our contracts. The FAR mandates uniform policies and procedures for U.S. government acquisitions and purchased services. Also, individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the FAR. For example, the DoD implements the FAR through the Defense Federal 
15

Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). For all federal government entities, the FAR regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition, including:

• | acquisition planning,


• | competition requirements,


• | contractor qualifications,


• | protection of source selection and vendor information, and


• | acquisition procedures.

In addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.
NON-U.S. REGULATORY
Our non-U.S. revenue is subject to the applicable government regulations and procurement policies and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.
BUSINESS-JET AIRCRAFT
The Aerospace group is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). For an aircraft to be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness. Aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority, which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.
ENVIRONMENTAL
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency. As a PRP, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination. In cases where we have been designated a PRP, generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate cost-recovery actions. In the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site, the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other PRPs. We regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters.
Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. Historically, these costs have not been material. Environmental costs often are recoverable under our contracts with the U.S. government. Based on information currently available and current U.S. government policies relating to cost recovery, we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters, see Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
