ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative solutions to enhance the lives of people with life-threatening diseases. Our primary focus is on therapies for patient populations in endocrinology, neurology, and gastroenterology. We currently have three commercially available products, Gvoke, a ready-to-use liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia, Keveyis, the first and only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved therapy for primary periodic paralysis (“PPP”) and Recorlev, approved by the FDA in December 2021 for the treatment of endogenous hypercortisolemia in adult patients with Cushing’s Syndrome. We also have a pipeline of development programs to extend our current marketed products into new indications and uses or bring new products forward using our proprietary formulation technology platforms, XeriSolTM and XeriJectTM. 
Commercial Products
Our number one priority is maximizing the commercial potential of our three commercial products: Gvoke, Keveyis and Recorlev. 
•Gvoke (Gvoke HypoPen, Gvoke PFS, Gvoke Kit) is the first ready-to-use liquid stable glucagon for severe hypoglycemia. The product is indicated for use in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes age 2 years and above and can be administered in 2 simple steps. The estimated total addressable market for this therapy is approximately $4.0 billion in the United States.
Throughout this document, unless otherwise noted, references to Gvoke include Gvoke PFS, Gvoke HypoPen, Gvoke Kit and Ogluo.
•Keveyis is the first and only therapy approved in the United States to treat hyperkalemic, hypokalemic, and related variants of PPP. PPP is a rare genetic, neuromuscular disorder that can cause extreme muscle weakness and/or paralysis; some forms are also commonly associated with myotonia or muscle stiffness. The estimated total addressable market for this therapy is greater than $0.5 billion in the United States.
•Recorlev is a cortisol synthesis inhibitor proved for the treatment of endogenous hypercortisolemia in adult patients with Cushing’s syndrome for whom surgery is not an option or has not been curative. Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is a rare but serious and potentially fatal endocrine disease caused by chronic elevated cortisol exposure. The estimated total addressable market for this therapy is approximately $2.0 billion in the United States. Recorlev was approved by FDA on December 30, 2021 and launched in the United States in January 2022.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to build a leading and profitable biopharmaceutical company that innovates products that transform the lives of people with life-threatening diseases. To achieve our goal, we are pursuing the following strategies:

< | Maximize the commercial potential of our three commercial products. We have built out a robust endocrinology and rare disease-focused commercial infrastructure – including fully operational patient and provider support teams – primed to bring the benefits of our products to a wider range of patients with unmet needs. Our sales, marketing, market access and patient service capabilities in the United States are positioned to drive the growth of our products. We believe that our ability to execute on this strategy is enhanced by the significant commercial experience of key members of our management team. 
< | Create momentum through commercial execution leading to profitability. We have three innovative commercial assets: Gvoke, Keveyis and Recorlev. Gvoke and Keveyis are growing in large untapped addressable markets. We are executing a rapid launch of Recorlev, leveraging our experienced, endocrinology-focused commercial infrastructure, in a large and unsatisfied Cushing Syndrome marketplace. Through the momentum created by the execution of our three commercial products, we believe we will have a path to profitability. 
< | Continue to leverage our technology and expertise to develop a portfolio of product candidates. We have an extensive pipeline of development programs to extend the current marketed products into important new indications and uses, and bring new products forward using our formulation technology platforms, supporting long-term product development and commercial success. XeriSol and XeriJect have broad application and have the potential to be utilized across a range of potential product candidates in endocrinology, neurology and other therapeutic areas. 
< | Collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to apply our technology platforms to enhance the formulations of their proprietary products and candidates. We are pursuing formulation and development partnerships to apply our XeriSol and XeriJect technology platforms to broaden our revenue stream and enhance the formulation, delivery and clinical profile of other companies’ proprietary drugs and biologics. We currently are working with several major pharmaceutical companies on feasibility programs to evaluate the formulation of their proprietary therapeutics with XeriSol or XeriJect. Our strategic goal is to enter into broader development and ultimately commercial licensing agreements with these partners upon successful completion of the feasibility programs.

We believe these four pillars of our strategy can bring new products to market and transform the lives of patients with life-threatening diseases and ultimately drive value for Xeris’ shareholders. Pursuing these strategies provides Xeris with a range of value driving opportunities that are incremental to the value already realized by the Xeris enterprise. 
Business Combination
On May 24, 2021, Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Xeris Pharma”) entered into a definitive agreement with Strongbridge Biopharma plc (“Strongbridge”) to acquire Strongbridge (the “Transaction”). Following consummation of the Transaction on October 5, 2021, Xeris Biopharma Holdings, Inc. (“Xeris Biopharma”) became the parent company of both Xeris Pharma and Strongbridge. The common stock of both Xeris Pharma and Strongbridge were de-registered after completion of the Transaction. On October 6, 2021, Xeris Biopharma’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “XERS.” Xeris Pharma was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Transaction. For further discussion on the Transaction, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and “Note 3 - Business combination” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our Technology Platforms
Overview
Our proprietary non-aqueous formulation technology platforms are designed to address the challenges presented by current aqueous formulations of certain drugs. Injectable pharmaceuticals have conventionally used aqueous delivery systems to administer drugs and biologics, but, in the presence of water, many drugs have poor solubility and low stability. To optimize their stability and enable longer-term storage, many of these products are freeze dried into a powder and, when needed, must be reconstituted with a liquid diluent, which is often a challenging multi-step procedure with the potential for error. Furthermore, the drug product begins to break down once combined with water, which requires the drug to be used immediately or otherwise refrigerated. In addition, these products can require complicated formulations and large injection volumes to make them soluble. For many products, these volumes are too large for SC or IM delivery and instead necessitate IV infusion over several hours. These drugs can be difficult or painful to administer and have limited portability, resulting in an overall poor experience for patients and caregivers.
Our proprietary XeriSol and XeriJect platforms offer the opportunity to eliminate the need for reconstitution and refrigeration, enable long-term room-temperature stability, significantly reduce injection volume and allow for a more convenient SC or IM administration as opposed to IV infusion, all of which we believe are distinct advantages over existing aqueous formulations of marketed products and development-stage product candidates. We believe that our technology platforms can lead to products that will improve outcomes and enable easier administration while reducing costs for payors and the healthcare system.
Our XeriJect formulation platform is best suited for drugs and biologics consisting of large molecules, such as proteins, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. XeriSol is best suited for peptides and small molecules that currently encounter formulation challenges. With XeriJect, we routinely formulate suspensions with a protein concentration in excess of 400 mg/mL, far exceeding current aqueous formulation systems with maximum achievable protein concentrations of 50-250 mg/mL. These biocompatible non-aqueous, injectable solutions or suspensions formulated using our technology platforms can then be packaged for administration in a commercially available auto-injector, pre-filled syringe, vial, multi-dose pen or infusion pump.
Our Products
Gvoke
Gvoke offers ready-to-use, room-temperature stable glucagon that is designed to be administered subcutaneously in a simple two-step process via a pre-filled syringe (Gvoke PFS), auto-injector (Gvoke HypoPen) or soon-to-be available single dose vial and syringe kit (Gvoke Kit). In our human factors studies, 99% of users were able to successfully administer the full dose with either Gvoke PFS or Gvoke HypoPen. Conversely, in published human factors studies of traditional emergency liquid glucagon kits, only 6% to 31% of users were able to successfully administer the full dose. We believe we can establish Gvoke as a preferred emergency glucagon product and drive greater adoption and penetration of emergency glucagon therapy for patients and caregivers. Gvoke was approved in September 2019 by the FDA for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia, a potentially life-threatening condition, in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages two years and older. We began the field launch of Gvoke PFS and Gvoke HypoPen in January 2020 and July 2020, respectively. Both presentations are available in two doses: a 0.5 mg/0.1 mL dose for pediatric patients and a 1 mg/0.2 mL dose for adolescent and adult patients.
On August 23, 2021, we announced that a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) of Gvoke Kit was approved by the FDA. Gvoke Kit will be sold as a 1 mg/0.2 mL single dose vial and syringe kit. Gvoke Kit contains one (1) single-dose sterile syringe with markings for 0.1 mL (0.5 mg pediatric dose) and 0.2 mL (1 mg adult dose), and one single-dose vial containing 0.2 mL of solution. The Gvoke Kit will be available in March 2022.
On July 19, 2021, we announced that we had entered into an exclusive agreement with Tetris Pharma Limited (“Tetris”) for the commercialization of Ogluo in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland (the “Territory”). Under the terms of the applicable agreements, Xeris will be responsible for product supply and Tetris will be responsible for commercialization of Ogluo in the Territory. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the agreements, Xeris will receive consideration tied to the first commercial sale and other time-, launch- and sales-related milestones and collect a royalty on sales. We commercially launched Ogluo in United Kingdom through our commercialization partner, Tetris, in December 2021. We plan to pursue development and commercialization collaborations for most, if not all, of the non-U.S. markets we seek to enter.
Overview of Hypoglycemia 
Diabetes is a widespread condition that affects an estimated 537 million people worldwide with an estimated 22 million drug-treated people in the United States. Among people with diabetes in the United States, essentially all of the approximately 1.6 million people with T1D and 5.4 million people with T2D require insulin therapy to lower their blood glucose levels to achieve normal blood sugar levels and avoid hyperglycemia. Insulin treatment in people with diabetes can also lead to hypoglycemia, a deficiency of glucose in the bloodstream, which is more common in people with diabetes who are treated with insulin or substances that promote production of insulin. Hypoglycemia is the primary adverse reaction associated with insulin. 
Hypoglycemia is categorized by level of severity, expressed as mild (Level 1), moderate (Level 2) or severe (Level 3) hypoglycemic events. Definitions, symptoms and treatment recommendations for hypoglycemia per the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists ("AACE") are summarized in the figure below:
Hypoglycemic events of any severity are a daily concern for people with diabetes. Severe hypoglycemic events are extremely frightening for patients and caregivers and can result in cardiovascular disease, seizure, coma, and, if left untreated, death. Fear of hypoglycemia and the morbidity and mortality risks associated with it are a constant reality for people with diabetes. According to scientific literature, fear of hypoglycemia is a critical impediment to psychological well-being and quality of life and represents the greatest barrier to optimal glycemic control. Studies have shown that only 14% of those aged 18–25 years and 29% of those aged 26–50 years achieved optimal glycemic control by taking insulin.
While patients can take preventive measures, hypoglycemic events still occur. On average, people with T1D experience an episode of mild or moderate hypoglycemia twice per week and 30% to 40% of people with T1D experience one to three episodes of severe hypoglycemia per year. On average, half of people with T2D treated with insulin experience an episode of mild or moderate hypoglycemia and 20% experience at least one severe episode a year. According to recent statistics, hypoglycemia demanded 242,000 visits to the emergency department in 2018, and resulted in approximately $1.8 billion dollars in direct costs associated with emergency care, inpatient care, and ambulatory care in 2009. Additionally, severe hypoglycemia has been attributed to 27,000 deaths per year.
The ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommends that glucagon be prescribed for all individuals at increased risk of Level 2 or Level 3 hypoglycemia so that it is available should it be needed. Glucagon works to raise the glucose levels in a person’s blood by inducing the liver to convert glycogen, a type of stored sugar in the body, into glucose.
Limitations of Existing Emergency Liquid Glucagon Kits
Because of the urgent nature of severe hypoglycemia, the majority of severe hypoglycemic events are treated on an emergency basis, outside of a healthcare facility. Prior to the FDA's approval of Gvoke in September 2019 and Eli Lilly's Baqsimi, a nasally administered glucagon powder, in July 2019, there were only two emergency glucagon products available to treat severe hypoglycemia: Eli Lilly’s Glucagon Emergency Kit ("GEK") and Novo Nordisk’s GlucaGen® HypoKit®. Each of these products is sold as a vial of lyophilized glucagon powder with an exposed needle/syringe that contains a liquid diluent. The glucagon powder must be combined with the liquid diluent at the time of use and drawn into a syringe in accordance with a complex multi-step reconstitution and dose calibration procedure. Long-term storage of the combined solution is impractical because once the lyophilized glucagon is combined with water, the solution becomes unstable and can fibrillate, rendering it inactive and potentially toxic. The multi-step reconstitution and dose calibration procedure required for traditional glucagon kits can be intimidating, particularly in an emergency situation, for likely glucagon kit users, a group that includes caregivers, co-workers, friends, teachers or other bystanders.
In 2018, we conducted a quantitative study with 700 caregivers and people with diabetes evaluating the market perceptions of traditional glucagon kits, which we refer to as our Caregiver and Patient Perceptions Study. In that study, only one third of respondents had a highly favorable opinion of the traditional kits and only half were confident that a glucagon kit user would be able to correctly administer the traditional emergency glucagon products. Furthermore, in three published comparative human factors 
studies with traditional kits, only 6% to 31% of users were able to successfully administer the full dose of glucagon. In other words, in these studies, test subjects failed to deliver the full dose of glucagon 69% to 94% of the time. Accordingly, a diabetes patient experiencing a severe hypoglycemic episode who relies on a bystander to administer glucagon may not receive the full dose of glucagon needed to restore their blood glucose levels. Failure to promptly treat severe hypoglycemia leaves the person at critical risk of irreversible brain damage and heart problems, especially in people who already have coronary artery disease. If emergency medical treatment is not successful, the severe hypoglycemic event can be fatal.
Of the units of glucagon rescue products dispensed in the United States at the end of 2021, legacy kits and Baqsimi represented approximately 42% and 38%, respectively, Gvoke represented approximately 20% and Zegalogue represented less than 1%.
Gvoke Key Features and Benefits
Leveraging our patented XeriSol technology, we believe Gvoke offers an important advancement in the treatment of severe hypoglycemia. Gvoke is the first ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon product approved that can be administered via a pre-filled syringe (Gvoke PFS), auto-injector (Gvoke HypoPen) or single dose vial and syringe kit (Gvoke Kit). Gvoke is currently available in two doses: a 0.5 mg/0.1 mL dose for pediatric patients and a 1 mg/0.2 mL dose for adolescent and adult patients. These innovative formats are designed to provide the reliability of a ready-to-use liquid glucagon while allowing patients or caregivers to administer it quickly and simply. 
The key features of Gvoke PFS and Gvoke HypoPen are:

< | Ready-to-use: With its two-step administration process, the user of Gvoke HypoPen, pulls off the cap and pushes down on the skin for five seconds until the viewing window turns red, or with Gvoke PFS, pulls off the cap, inserts the needle at a 90-degree angle and pushes the plunger down as far as it will go. There is no reconstitution required at the time of emergency.
< | Reliable administration: In our human factors studies, 99% of users were able to successfully administer the full dose. 
< | No dose calibration required: Gvoke is offered in two pre-measured doses: 0.5 mg/0.1 mL dose for pediatric patients and 1 mg/0.2 mL dose for adolescent and adult patients. 
< | 24 to 30 months room-temperature stability: No refrigeration is required at any time. 

In addition, key features specific to the Gvoke HypoPen are:

< | No visible needle: The needle in the Gvoke HypoPen is not visible to the user.
< | Auto-retraction: The needle auto-retracts after administration for safety. 
< | Auto-locks: The device auto-locks after use for safety. 

In our Caregiver and Patient Perceptions Study conducted in 2018, more than 75% of subjects responded that they would prefer Gvoke HypoPen over the then-existing traditionally available glucagon kits. Also in 2018, we conducted a quantitative study of over 400 healthcare professionals, which we refer to as our Healthcare Professional Perceptions Study. In that study, results indicated that glucagon would be prescribed to more people across all clinically appropriate patient segments if Gvoke HypoPen was available. Based on this market research, we believe that the glucagon market will become more penetrated and that Gvoke HypoPen will become the preferred emergency glucagon delivery solution to the existing traditionally available glucagon kits.
Gvoke Market Potential
Based on current market data as well as our Caregiver and Patient and Healthcare Professional Perceptions Studies, we believe that Gvoke has the opportunity to increase penetration of the glucagon market in severe hypoglycemia by increasing the number of people with diabetes who have a filled glucagon prescription and by increasing the number of glucagon rescue devices they have on hand.
There are approximately 22 million drug-treated people with diabetes in the United States, and the annual growth rate in incidence of diagnosed and treated people with diabetes is approximately 4% per year. An additional 96 million people in the United States are pre-diabetic and may progress to T2D. The ADA recommends that glucagon be prescribed for all individuals at increased risk of Level 2 or Level 3 hypoglycemia so that it is available should it be needed. Based on our Healthcare Professional Perceptions Study, we believe all people on insulin are considered clinically appropriate for glucagon. In the United States, there is an estimated 1.6 million people with T1D who are treated with insulin because their bodies do not naturally produce insulin and approximately 5.4 million additional people with T2D who are treated with insulin because their bodies do not use insulin properly. In the aggregate, we estimate that the potential target population for emergency glucagon therapy totals approximately 7.0 million people in the United States. We believe every person who is on insulin therapy should have ready-to-use glucagon available for a potential severe hypoglycemic episode. With such an expansion in glucagon prescriptions, and also by increasing penetration into the market for emergency glucagon kits, the United States potential market opportunity may be up to $4.0 billion.
Despite the risk of experiencing a severe hypoglycemic event, we believe that emergency glucagon therapy is under-appreciated, under-evaluated and under-taught, resulting in a market that is underpenetrated. In the United States, approximately 693,000 total 
prescriptions for emergency glucagon were written in 2021, or an 7% increase from 2020. In 2021, a total of approximately 1 million units of emergency glucagon products were dispensed in the United States, representing total sales of approximately $281 million. 
We commercially launched Ogluo in the United Kingdom through our commercialization partner, Tetris, in December 2021. Considering the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we estimate that there are an additional 5 million people with diabetes on insulin. However, annually there are only approximately 1.2M units of glucagon sold in the retail setting, which we believe indicates that the market for emergency glucagon products is significantly underpenetrated in the Territory.
Commercial Strategy
Our commercial strategy is to increase the number of prescribed and dispensed emergency glucagon products, specifically Gvoke, for people on insulin therapy. Our sales force is focused on driving awareness and adoption of Gvoke by healthcare professionals.
We began the field launch of Gvoke PFS in January 2020, Gvoke HypoPen in July 2020 and Gvoke Kit in 2022. Our strategy for Gvoke includes the following: 

< | Drive awareness, adoption and utilization of Gvoke. We plan to drive awareness and adoption of Gvoke to expand glucagon adoption. 
 | o | Healthcare Professionals: We are targeting certified diabetes care and education specialists and high insulin and glucagon prescribing healthcare professionals. We are reaching these professionals using our field and inside sales teams. 
 | o | Patients and Caregivers: We are activating patients through patient advocacy organizations and leveraging channels such as direct-to-consumer advertising, patient influencer content, digital presence, traditional off-line channels, social media and press coverage to drive awareness and communicate our value proposition to patients and caregivers. 
< | Penetrate the market. We believe that the Gvoke market is currently significantly underpenetrated due to the lack of, and limitations in, previous treatment options. We have designed Gvoke to offer healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers a ready-to-use alternative that facilitates administration of the full dose of glucagon every time it is used. We believe this product offering, paired with our commercial focus, has the potential to grow the market in two ways: 
 | o | Healthcare Professionals: In addition to certified diabetes care and education specialists and high insulin and glucagon prescribing healthcare professionals, we are targeting healthcare professionals who are high mealtime insulin prescribers but who are not high prescribers of glucagon. We are reaching these professionals using our field and inside sales teams.
 | o | Patients and Caregivers: We believe there are opportunities to activate patient and caregiver demand for Gvoke. Gvoke is designed as a ready-to-use solution for a segment of patients and caregivers who currently lack the confidence in administering traditional emergency glucagon kits and would rather rely on emergency responders for treatment. 
< | Promote access. Of our target patient population, approximately 60% are commercially insured, approximately 20% are covered by Medicare and approximately 20% are covered by Medicaid and other government programs. We plan to continue our focus on promoting access to Gvoke. We believe that all patients should have access to potentially lifesaving products such as Gvoke. We have engaged with payors to more fully understand their drivers and barriers and convey the health and pharmacoeconomic value of Gvoke. 
< | Impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that customer demand has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, we suspended in-person interactions by our sales and marketing personnel in healthcare settings. We are engaging with these customers remotely, via webinar programs and virtual meetings, as we seek to continue to support healthcare professionals and patient care. Some of our sales and marketing personnel began to reengage with a limited number of in-person interactions. However, with the resurgence of COVID-19 variants in early 2022, our ability to connect with our customers in person became much more limited and we quickly moved back to more remote interactions. In addition, several conferences and other programs at which we intended to market Gvoke have been postponed or transitioned to virtual meetings. Remote interactions may be less effective than in-person interactions. We have also revised our patient copay assistance program to offer a copay card with a buy-down to $0 for commercially eligible patients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have established a distribution channel in the United States for the commercialization of Gvoke, which is currently being sold primarily to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, who, in turn, sell Gvoke to pharmacies and other customers. We use a third-party logistics provider for key services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, distribution, contract administration, order management and chargeback processing and accounts receivable management. 
Keveyis
Keveyis (dichlorphenamide) is the first and only therapy approved in the United States to treat hyperkalemic, hypokalemic and related variants of PPP, a group of rare hereditary disorders that cause episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis. 
Overview of PPP 
PPP is a rare, genetic, neuromuscular disorder related to a defect in muscle ion channels with multiple variants and subtypes. The disease is characterized by episodes of muscle weakness and paralysis. It often interferes with daily activities and, as patients get older, it can lead to permanent muscle weakness. PPP may be localized (“focal”) or more widespread (“generalized”), and it often 
goes underdiagnosed and/or undertreated. Types of periodic paralysis are differentiated by criteria including underlying genetic mutations and changes in blood potassium during an episode. The two most common forms of PPP are hypokalemic, when episodes can be induced by low blood levels of potassium, and hyperkalemic, when episodes are associated with elevated levels of blood potassium. We believe, based on our market research, that there are approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients in the United States diagnosed with PPP.
Keveyis Features and Benefits
Keveyis is an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that was approved by the FDA in the United States in August 2015 to treat hyperkalemic, hypokalemic and related variants of PPP. The exact mechanism(s) through which oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and Keveyis in particular, decrease the frequency and severity of periodic paralysis attacks is unknown. However, it is believed that their effects are mediated both locally (i.e., in muscle) and systemically. It is not known whether their effects are disease-modifying. Keveyis has received orphan drug exclusivity status in the United States through August 7, 2022.
Keveyis has been studied in two separate double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center studies and proven to be an effective treatment for PPP. Keveyis was shown to decrease the number of PPP episodes. In addition, episodes that did occur were shorter in duration and not as severe. The most common adverse reactions with incidence ≥10% and rates greater than placebo in patients treated with Keveyis were paresthesia, cognitive disorder, dysgeusia, and confusional state. Less than 10% (3/36) of all patients treated with Keveyis in one study withdrew due to an adverse reaction in the double-blind phase; 17% of hyperkalemic patients (2/12) and ~4% (1/24) of hypokalemic patients discontinued treatment.
Keveyis Market Potential
We believe, based on our market research, that there are approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients in the United States diagnosed with PPP and we believe that we can address the market by targeting physicians who are managing patients with PPP, including neuromuscular specialists, general neurologists and primary care physicians.
Keveyis Commercial Strategy
Our commercial strategy for Keveyis is to promote its unique benefits, as well as a concerted effort to raise awareness about the underlying PPP disease among the physician/patient/caregiver community with the goal of increasing the rate of diagnosis when the symptoms may otherwise be overlooked.  In addition to a specialty sales force, we established a field-based group of patient access managers and medical affairs liaisons. We use a single, specialty pharmacy to provide reimbursement, clinical and distribution support for Keveyis and to develop cost-sharing and patient assistance programs to support qualified, commercially insured patients, federal- and state-insured patients, and uninsured or under-insured patients. We also donate money to independent charitable foundations dedicated to this cause. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that no PPP patient is denied access to Keveyis for financial reasons. We work with the patient community to advocate for patients improving diagnosis, genetic testing and treatment. 
Recorlev
Recorlev (levoketoconazole), the pure 2S,4R enantiomer of the enantiomeric pair comprising ketoconazole. Recorlev is a next-generation steroidogenesis inhibitor. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Recorlev, levoketoconazole, exerts its primary therapeutic effect by blocking the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal glands, leading to the reduction and, ideally, the normalization of blood cortisol. Levoketoconazole has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. 
Levoketoconazole inhibits the cortisol synthesis pathway at several points. Based on the results from our SONICS and LOGICS clinical trials, we believe that Recorlev can have a beneficial impact on hypercortisolism, the hallmark of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, as well as benefits related to several comorbidities of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, including those associated with cardiovascular disease risk, such as diabetes, weight gain and elevation in LDL-cholesterol. 
On December 30, 2021 we announced the FDA approval of Recorlev for the treatment of endogenous hypercortisolemia in adult patients with Cushing’s syndrome for whom surgery is not an option or has not been curative. Recorlev is not approved for the treatment of fungal infections. The approval of Recorlev was based upon safety and efficacy data from two positive Phase 3 studies that evaluated a combined study population of 166 patients, which was representative of the adult drug-treated U.S. population with Cushing’s syndrome. The SONICS study met its primary and key secondary endpoints, significantly reducing and normalizing mean urinary free cortisol concentrations without a dose increase. LOGICS, a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized-withdrawal study that met its primary and key secondary endpoints, confirmed the efficacy and safety of Recorlev in normalizing and maintaining therapeutic response compared with placebo.
Overview of Endogenous Cushing’s Syndrome
There are two variants of Cushing’s syndrome: exogenous, which is caused by factors outside the body (e.g., corticosteroid or cortisol-like medications) and endogenous, which is caused by factors within the body. The signs and symptoms may be the same in both forms. The much more common form is exogenous Cushing’s syndrome, which is often found in people taking cortisol-like medications for long periods of time or for shorter periods of time using more potent forms. Cortisol-like medications are often used to treat inflammatory disorders such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, exogenous Cushing’s syndrome may be alleviated by withdrawing the inciting medication.
Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by sustained elevated blood cortisol. Cortisol is a hormone produced in the adrenal gland and is naturally secreted as an end-product of the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Corticotropin-releasing-hormone (“CRH”) is secreted from the hypothalamus and stimulates the secretion and release of adrenocorticotropin (“ACTH”) from the pituitary gland, which in turn stimulates cortisol (and other hormone) secretion from the adrenal gland. Cortisol itself exerts negative feedback control on both CRH in the hypothalamus and ACTH in the pituitary gland, thereby reducing CRH and ACTH secretion, keeping cortisol levels in a normal range.
The most common form of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is called Cushing’s disease, which is typically caused by a benign pituitary tumor that secretes ACTH autonomously. Cushing’s disease represents approximately 70% to 80% of patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Other causes of endogenous ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome include extrapituitary tumors producing ACTH, known as ectopic ACTH, or less often CRH (ectopic CRH). The source of ectopic ACTH/CRH secretion is most often small-cell carcinoma of the lung or bronchial carcinoid tumors, but neuroendocrine tumors found in many different organs can also be sources. In a smaller number of cases, approximately 20%, endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is ACTH-independent, meaning that it does not arise through tumor secretion of ACTH but rather results from excess autonomous secretion of cortisol itself in the adrenal gland by adrenocortical tumors, either benign or malignant, or by non-malignant enlargement of the adrenal glands called hyperplasia.
In patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, the normal feedback mechanisms of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are disrupted. This causes chronic exposure to high circulating cortisol levels that give rise to the clinical state of Cushing’s syndrome. The most common signs and symptoms of the syndrome include: weight gain, sometimes with unusual fat accumulation in the upper body with a rounded face (“moon face”) and extra fat on the upper back and above the collarbones, along with abdominal fat; high blood sugar or diabetes mellitus; high blood pressure or hypertension; thin bones or osteoporosis; muscle loss or sarcopenia; thin, fragile skin that bruises easily; purple-red stretch marks called striae, usually over the abdomen and under the arms; depression and difficulty thinking clearly; too much facial hair, or hirsutism, usually noticed only in women; irregular or absent menstrual periods and infertility; reduced sex drive or libido; and in children, poor height growth.
An estimated 25,000 patients in the United States are diagnosed with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. When first diagnosed, patients are most commonly adults aged 20 to 50 and five times more often women than men. However, endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is believed to be underdiagnosed due to lack of disease recognition, resulting in a delay in diagnosis of six years on average. Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients are believed to have a mortality risk two to three times that of the age-and-gender-matched general population, with cardiovascular disease, including venous thrombosis and infections being the primary causes of death.
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations of Current Treatment Options
Treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome varies depending on the cause of the disease. For patients with Cushing’s disease, initial treatment is almost always the attempted surgical removal of the pituitary tumor. In anticipation of surgery and when surgery is not effective or not an option, drug or radiation therapy, or both, is used to suppress excessive cortisol production and the accompanying clinical symptoms.
A typical approach to drug therapy is to inhibit cortisol synthesis through the oral administration of an inhibitor of enzymes that regulate adrenal cortisol synthesis. Although approved in the European Union for this indication, ketoconazole is not approved for this indication by the FDA and is therefore prescribed “off-label”. The percentage of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients treated with ketoconazole monotherapy who achieve normalized levels of cortisol, assessed by measuring UFC has been reported from retrospective, uncontrolled studies, with varying definitions of normalization, to be between 33% and 100%. 
Metyrapone is another cortisol synthesis inhibitor that blocks cortisol in a different way than ketoconazole or Recorlev. It is not approved for treatment of Cushing’s syndrome in the US but is used off-label. Metyrapone is approved for use in the United Kingdom and certain other countries as a therapeutic drug for CS. Elsewhere, including in the US, it is approved as a diagnostic agent in Cushing’s disease. A drug that works through a similar pathway as metyrapone, called Isturisa (osilodrostat), was granted a marketing authorization in the European Union on January 15, 2020 and in the United States on March 6, 2020. Etomidate is an intravenously administered sedative that potently inhibits 11β-hydroxylase, like metyrapone and osilodrostat, and is highly effective to reduce cortisol, but its use is typically limited to the inpatient setting.
An alternative medical approach to treating Cushing’s syndrome targets pituitary tumors that produce ACTH (i.e., in Cushing’s disease). Among Cushing’s disease patients, the dopamine agonist cabergoline, which is not approved for use to treat Cushing’s disease in the United States, has been shown to achieve normalization of UFC levels, gold-standard evidence of disease control, in about 30% of patients. The SSA (somatosatin analog) pasireotide, which is marketed as Signifor and Signifor LAR for the treatment of Cushing’s disease in the United States, has shown normalization of UFC levels with stable dosing of the immediate-release formulation in 15% of patients at a dosage of 600 µg twice-daily and in 26% of patients at a dosage of 900 µg twice-daily over a six-month period. Certain SSAs, including Signifor, are known to have undesirable side effects on glucose metabolism. Forty percent of patients with Cushing’s disease treated with Signifor in its Phase 3 clinical trial reported the occurrence of hyperglycemia-related adverse events, and in the cohort receiving Signifor 900 µg twice-daily, glycated hemoglobin (“HbA1c”) increased from 5.8% at baseline to 7.3% at Month 6.
Another alternative drug therapy, Korlym, or mifepristone, works by inhibiting the action of cortisol at the cortisol-receptor level but does not lower blood cortisol levels, which actually tend to increase during therapy. As a result of this mechanism of action, it is not possible to monitor response (i.e., effectiveness and safety) to Korlym by measuring UFC or cortisol levels (from blood or saliva), which are the standard ways clinicians monitor disease progression and response to treatment. As a result, Korlym is usually titrated 
and monitored through use of clinical signs and symptoms improvements (e.g., blood sugar reductions). Korlym has been approved in the United States to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who also have diabetes mellitus. About one-third of patients with endogenous Cushing syndrome have diabetes. Korlym is contraindicated in pregnant women and in women with a history of unexplained vaginal bleeding, as its side effects include termination of pregnancy, endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding. It is also frequently associated with hypokalemia.
Mitotane is an adrenolytic agent (i.e., it destroys the adrenal gland at higher doses) that inhibits steroidogenesis non-selectively at low doses, mainly at 20,22-desmolase (cholesterol side-chain cleavage). It seems to be used primarily in adrenocortical cancer, where it had an FDA indication. There are no prospective clinical trials describing the use of mitotane in non-malignant endogenous CS, and it is not approved for that use.
We believe that the efficacy and usage limitations and safety concerns associated with other currently available drug therapies for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome are an important reason why a significant unmet medical need exists among endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients with persistent or recurrent disease post-surgery. In a survey we commissioned in 2019 of 253 U.S. physicians treating patients with Cushing’s syndrome. When asked what percentage of their endogenous Cushing’s patients currently receiving pharmacological therapy, they would consider have symptoms controlled vs. uncontrolled by their medication(s) for CS, the surveyed physicians indicated that approximately 39% of patients were uncontrolled vs. 61% were controlled. We believe that our potential addressable market for Recorlev includes diagnosed endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients that at any time are eligible for drug therapy, including patients for whom surgery or radiation is not feasible, is contraindicated or has been unsuccessful.
Recorlev Clinical Trials Program
The Phase 3 program for Recorlev included SONICS and LOGICS, two multinational studies designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Recorlev when used to treat endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. The SONICS study met its primary and secondary endpoints, significantly reducing and normalizing mean urinary free cortisol concentrations without a dose increase. The LOGICS study, which met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint, was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized-withdrawal study of Recorlev that was designed to supplement the efficacy and safety information provided by SONICS. The ongoing open-label OPTICS study will gather further useful information related to the long-term use of Recorlev.
The key secondary efficacy endpoint the LOGICS study was the proportion of patients with mUFC normalization, defined as a patient with mUFC at or below the upper limit of normal reference range (ULN) at the end of randomized withdrawal phase without meeting a requirement for early rescue during the randomized withdrawal phase. Out of the 79 patients who entered the dose titration and maintenance phase, 37 (47%) patients who met the requirement to be on a stable therapeutic dose for at least 4 weeks and established normal mUFC at the end of the dose titration and maintenance phase, and 2 patients who did not meet the requirement due to abnormal mUFC, continued to the randomized-withdrawal phase. Out of 5 patients from the SONICS study who were enrolled directly in the randomized withdrawal phase, 2 patients had normal mUFC. Among the 39 patients who had normal mUFC at the randomized withdrawal phase baseline, 21 were randomized to the Recorlev group and 18 to the placebo group. The number and percent of patients who had normal mUFC at the end of the randomized withdrawal phase was 11/21 (52.4%) in Recorlev group and 1/18 (5.6%) in placebo group, and the treatment difference (CI) was 46.8% (16.5%, 70.2%). Out of 11 patients with normal mUFC at the end of the randomized-withdrawal phase, 7 patients in the Recorlev group had normal mUFC throughout the randomized-withdrawal phase.
The primary efficacy endpoint of the SONICS study was the proportion of patients with normalization of mUFC at the end of the 6-month maintenance phase. Normalization of mUFC was defined as mUFC at or below the ULN based on central laboratory result without requiring a dose increase during the maintenance phase. At the end of the maintenance phase, 29 of 94 patients (30.9%, 95% exact confidence interval 21.7%, 41.2%) met the primary endpoint. 
The most common adverse reactions (incidence > 20%) for LOGICS and SONICS were nausea/vomiting, hypokalemia, hemorrhage/contusion, systemic hypertension, headache, hepatic injury, abnormal uterine bleeding, erythema, fatigue, abdominal pain/dyspepsia, arthritis, upper respiratory infection, myalgia, arrhythmia, back pain, insomnia/sleep disturbances, and peripheral edema.
Elevations in AST or ALT post baseline were reported in patients treated with Recorlev who had AST or ALT ≤ ULN at baseline in LOGICS and SONICS. There were 11 out of 166 patients who had an AST or ALT above the ULN to ˂3 x ULN at baseline. Of these patients, 3 had increases above 3 x ULN, and none had increases above 5 x ULN. Liver test abnormalities improved with cessation of medication.
In the LOGICS and SONICS studies combined, there were 4 (2.4%) patients who experienced QTcF>500 msec, and 23 (14.7%) patients who experienced change-from-baseline QTcF >60 msec, respectively. Adverse reactions reported around the same time that may have been associated with QT prolongation included fatigue, hypertension, nausea/vomiting, and ventricular extrasystoles. 
The FDA-approved labeling for Recorlev includes a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity and QT prolongation Recorlev has been associated with serious hepatotoxicity and dose-related QT interval prolongation. 
OPTICS Phase 3 Clinical Trial
In 2018, we initiated a long-term, open-label extension trial with Recorlev (“OPTICS”) to capture longer-term safety, tolerability and efficacy data from patients who complete either SONICS or LOGICS and who chose to continue therapy with Recorlev. OPTICS will continue to accrue data on each enrolled patient for a minimum of three years or until Recorlev has become available in their own country, whichever comes first. 
Market Potential 
On December 30, 2021, the FDA approved Recorlev for the treatment of endogenous hypercortisolemia in adult patients with Cushing’s Syndrome for whom surgery is not an option or has not been curative and Recorlev became commercially available in January 2022. We believe approximately 8,000 Cushing’s patients are managed pharmacologically in the U.S. with a tremendous amount of unmet need since nearly 40% of patients are poorly controlled on their current medication. We believe that this values the Cushing’s market in the U.S. at approximately $2 billion annually. Cushing’s Syndrome is a complex disease, and we believe that patients could significantly benefit from additional support services and educational resources in conjunction with therapy. For this reason, we have partnered with a specialty pharmacy to provide a customized support and product distribution program, Xeris CareConnection™, for members of the Recorlev ecosystem, including appropriate patients, caregivers, physicians, and payors. Xeris CareConnection provides support services throughout the entire treatment journey to patients and healthcare professionals with direct access to pharmacists, reimbursement specialists and access managers. The comprehensive patient support program includes welcome information, therapy onboarding, at-home delivery of medication, a discreet courier service for urinary free cortisol (UFC) test collection, automatic monthly refill shipments, financial assistance programs, one-on-one support, and ongoing educational resources. 
Our Product Candidates
Ready-to-Use Glucagon (XP-9164) for Gastroenterology
We are currently in Phase 1 development with product candidate XP-9164, an early-stage compound for gastroenterology. 
XP-9164 is intended to address unmet needs in the growing procedural gastroenterology market. Glucagon transiently decreases peristalsis of smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract. Glucagon administration during gastrointestinal imaging permits more precise visualization for studies and procedures. It is also used in abdominal vascular procedures such as treating esophageal varices and other GI bleeds. Glucagon is also utilized in biopsies, abscess drainage, GI stenting, gastrostomy tube placement and colonoscopies. In 2019 there were ~17M colonoscopies performed in the U.S. A ready-to-use glucagon may potentially address a number of areas of needed improvement: improved operational efficiency, no reconstitution (and thus fewer reconstitution errors), room temperature stable liquid, faster preparation and possibly less waste.
Ready-to-Use Glucagon for Exercise-Induced Hypoglycemia(EIH) in Diabetes
Exercise-induced (or exercise-associated) hypoglycemia and the complexity of management aimed at its prevention represent major barriers to the adoption of regular physical activity for many individuals with diabetes treated with insulin. Although carbohydrate ingestion, including oral glucose tablets, can help ameliorate hypoglycemia, patients’ carbohydrate requirements can be as high as 1 gram per minute of exercise, which can be counterproductive to weight management. Aerobic exercise, in particular, often results in a significant drop in blood glucose concentrations. Qualitative feedback has shown that the challenges in current exercise management strategies and the need to consume carbohydrates are frustrating and may lead to minimized or complete omission of exercise for many patients. People with diabetes who are on intensive insulin regimens are at risk of EIH. We believe there is a subset of these individuals that exercises at least three times per week per current guidelines who could potentially use a mini-dose of ready-to-use glucagon each time they exercise. 
Xeris Offering—Mini-doses of Ready-to-Use Glucagon for Treatment of EIH
We are developing a mini-dose of our ready-to-use, liquid-stable glucagon and have observed appropriate dose-dependent PK and PD responses when administered subcutaneously at doses of 75, 150 and 300 µg in adults with T1D. A proof-of-concept study further demonstrated that a mini-dose of 150 µg of glucagon prevented non-severe hypoglycemia to a substantially similar degree as oral glucose tablets that are commonly used during exercise to prevent or correct non-severe hypoglycemia in adults with T1D. As such, the use of mini-dose glucagon enabled patients to avoid the unnecessary caloric intake inherent in glucose tablets or other types of carbohydrates.
There currently are no FDA-approved glucagon products that enable individuals to modestly increase glucagon levels at the start of exercise. Glucagon rescue kits exist as a lyophilized powder that must be reconstituted in diluent immediately prior to injection as they are unstable in aqueous solutions for extended periods of time. Despite the challenging reconstitution process, there has been significant documented off-label use, in which patients with T1D mini-dose glucagon using the traditional glucagon kits. 
Clinical Experience
We have successfully completed a number of preclinical studies in multiple species to support the safety of mini-dose glucagon, as well as Phase 2 safety and efficacy clinical trials in subjects with T1D.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials
XSMP-203: The Use of Mini-Dose Glucagon to Prevent Exercise-Induced Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes
Based on previous dose-finding trials (XSMP-201 and XSMP-202), we collaborated on a third Phase 2 clinical trial of mini-dose glucagon for EIH in the first quarter of 2016. The primary analysis of this trial was comparison of the glycemic response of 150 µg mini-dose glucagon against current standards of care, including basal insulin reduction and glucose tablet consumption, to mitigate EIH. 
The study concluded that mini-dose glucagon (150 µg) was more effective at preventing EIH than insulin reduction which was associated with a similar rate and magnitude of hypoglycemia as no intervention. Moreover, while mini-dose glucagon was as effective as glucose tablets for preventing EIH, mini-dose glucagon resulted in less post-intervention hyperglycemia than ingestion of carbohydrates and avoided the consumption of unnecessary calories. The results of this study were published in 2018 in the journal Diabetes Care. 
XSMP-204: A Phase 2 Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Parallel Study to Evaluate Glucagon RTU (Glucagon Injection) Compared to Standard of Care for the Prevention of Exercise-Induced Hypoglycemia During Regular Aerobic Exercise in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes 
This trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-treatment, two-period, crossover comparison in a clinical research center (CRC) setting, followed by a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind two-arm comparison with a third open-label arm in an outpatient setting to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of RTU glucagon to prevent EIH in adults with T1D who perform regular, moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise. In January 2020, we reported that a mini-dose of RTU glucagon was adequate to maintain normal blood glucose levels during prolonged, moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise in the CRC setting.
In the outpatient stage, the trial was examining if the subcutaneous administration of RTU glucagon just before exercise, with or without a 50% reduction in basal rate insulin, compared to a 50% basal rate insulin reduction alone prevents the occurrence of hypoglycemia (i.e., blood glucose <70 mg/dL) measured by blood glucose meter during and after moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise by adult subjects with T1D in an outpatient setting. In June 2020, we reported positive results from the outpatient stage of this Phase 2 study. Over this time when individually compared to standard of care alone, the number of EIH episodes was significantly less with RTU Glucagon + standard of care and with Open Label RTU Glucagon. RTU Glucagon + standard of care resulted in an approximately 70% lower rate of EIH when compared to standard of care alone. Additionally, Open Label RTU Glucagon resulted in an approximately 54% lower rate of EIH when compared to standard of care alone. The difference in the incidence rates of EIH between the two RTU Glucagon arms was not statistically significant.
Across all outpatient stage exercise sessions, the nominal use of oral glucose tablets during and after exercise, in order to treat hypoglycemia, was greater in the standard of care arm compared to RTU Glucagon + standard of care and Open Label RTU Glucagon. Consequently, the nominal incidence of hyperglycemia episodes (blood glucose > 180 mg/dl) was observed to be 2.4 fold greater in the standard of care arm when compared to RTU Glucagon + standard of care arm. RTU Glucagon did not appear to individually contribute to hyperglycemia. When hyperglycemia events did occur, the time duration and severity of events did not differ between treatment arms.
In both phases of the study, mini doses of RTU glucagon were safe and well tolerated, and no serious adverse events occurred.
Based on FDA interactions and expectations for a registrational program to support a mini-dose indication for Glucagon RTU in EIH, we submitted an IND in February 2022. We received FDA clearance in March 2022 and are actively planning to initiate a new phase 2 clinical program by the end of 2022 to further address the management of EIH in people with diabetes who use insulin.
Non-Glucagon Programs
Ready-to-Use Product for Endocrinology (Levothyroxine; XP-8121)
We are currently in Phase 1 development with product candidate XP-8121, an early-stage program designed to address maintenance therapy in patients with congenital or acquired hypothyroidism who require thyroid hormone replacement.
Levothyroxine and Hypothyroidism
The thyroid gland is responsible for the synthesis, storage, and release of metabolic hormones including thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones are crucial in the regulation of critical metabolic processes and are vital for normal growth and development during fetal life, infancy, and childhood.
Therapeutically, levothyroxine is administered when the body is deficient in the endogenous hormone. The goal of therapy is restoration of the euthyroid state which can reverse the clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism and significantly improve quality of life. The treatment of choice for correction of hypothyroidism is levothyroxine, which is the mainstay of thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It is one of the most widely prescribed drug products in the United States, but the complexity of maintaining biochemical and clinical euthyroidism in patients undergoing treatment with oral levothyroxine cannot be underestimated. It has been reported that nearly 40% of patients undergoing treatment with oral levothyroxine are either over- or under-treated due to factors that include, but are not limited to, drug formulation, use of the drug with food, adherence to the drug, use of concomitant medications, and pre-existing medical conditions. Many patients failing to reach target TSH levels are generally managed by simply increasing their levothyroxine daily dose. However, levothyroxine is a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, meaning that relatively small deviations from the proper dose can cause a clinically meaningful shift in pharmacological effects when administered to a patient; thus, the titration of levothyroxine oral drug may be a tailored and incremental process.
XP-8121 Overview
XP-8121 is a novel formulation for subcutaneous administration that could potentially mitigate many of the challenges associated with oral formulations, such as identification of an ideal dose due to absorption variation and medication adherence for patients who have 
difficulty maintaining a stable, therapeutic serum level. Preclinical studies of SC XP-8121 showed a sustained plasma exposure profile and similar Cmax when compared with equivalent doses of the oral formulation. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 study of XP-8121 to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, and potential for weekly dosing in the treatment of hypothyroidism.
The Phase 1 clinical study is a single ascending dose crossover design in 30 healthy participants to compare matching doses of oral levothyroxine (Synthroid®) and subcutaneous XP-8121. The primary endpoints of the study are to characterize the absorption and elimination kinetics of XP-8121 and compare bioavailability of XP-8121 to oral levothyroxine. Secondary endpoints are safety and tolerability of XP-8121.
Market Opportunity
There are more than 100 million prescriptions written for oral levothyroxine per year, making it one of the most prescribed therapies in the United States. Non-adherence to daily therapy, resistant hypothyroidism, and limited GI absorption are some of the major reasons for treatment failure or suboptimal treatment with oral levothyroxine. We believe these challenges could be mitigated by XP-8121, if approved, and translate into the long-term health benefit of achieving a euthyroid state for patients. It is estimated that 47% of patients have an associated GI condition o 15% experience inadequate control of symptoms. Assuming 56 million weekly doses per year and $30 per dose comparable to branded orals, this represents a $1 to $2 billion market opportunity. 
XeriSol Pramlintide-Insulin Co-formulation (XP-3924) 
Xeris Pharma has developed a novel, investigational fixed-ratio co-formulation of pramlintide and regular human insulin (XP-3924) to improve glycemic control in adult and pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus (T1D and T2D). Xeris’ proprietary formulation technology (XeriSol™) enables the 2 peptides (pramlintide and insulin), which require different aqueous pH environments for optimal stability, to be co-formulated in a stable ready-to-use solution. The current formulation patent exists through at least Q4 2032, expected to extend to 2036 with successful prosecution of the currently pending continuation application, and through 2041-2042 with the ongoing formulation development work
XP-3924 Market Opportunity
We believe XP-3924 has the opportunity to serve a large unmet need in patients on mealtime insulin, with the market opportunity estimated at $3-4 billion in the United States. It is estimated that ~1/3 of patients on mealtime insulin are not achieving their A1C goals despite optimized insulin therapy. Additional therapeutic options for patients with advanced diabetes not well-controlled on mealtime insulin are limited. The only pharmacological therapy indicated for such patients is pramlintide (Symlin®).  We have an open IND for XP-3924, recently completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in adults with Type 1 Diabetes and obtained FDA feedback on the clinical development and regulatory requirements for submitting a 351(a) stand-alone BLA. We are currently seeking partners to license the development and commercialization rights to XP-3924 in the US.
Ready-to-Use Diazepam (XP-0863)
XP-0863 is a liquid formulation of diazepam for intramuscular injection being studied for the treatment of ARS. Xeris’ patent protected technology XeriSol™ has been used to develop a room-temperature stable, ready-to-use, small-volume solution of diazepam for intramuscular injection delivered by an auto-injector, which will provide patients and caregivers an alternative to rectal and nasal administrations of benzodiazepines. XP-0863 is designed to address variable absorption, and suboptimal PK profiles of the currently marketed formulations of benzodiazepines, by offering a longer duration of action, consistent absorption of drug delivered through intramuscular administration, and a convenient and reliable form factor of the autoinjector. XP-0863 has been granted an orphan designation by the FDA for the treatment of ARS and Dravet syndrome in patients with epilepsy. Approximately 160,000 people in the United States experience ARS. 
Injectable and rectal gel formulations of diazepam are the current standard of care for the emergency treatment of epileptic seizures. In 2018, diazepam formulations generated total U.S. sales of approximately $86 million, of which Diastat® Rectal Gel and its generic formulations comprised $74 million. Diastat requires a multi-step procedure which makes it more difficult to administer while a patient is experiencing seizures. Additionally, the use of rectal gel in both middle school children and young adults with ARS is reduced because of social stigma. These characteristics are limitations that may diminish the specific demand for rectal diazepam products. Due to this limitation, we believe the market for diazepam in ARS is underpenetrated. We believe that a ready-to-use diazepam injectable rescue pen would improve patient quality of life and drive adoption of diazepam to treat ARS. We believe that, if approved, XP-0863 would have the opportunity to fill the unmet need in ARS for a reliable, user-friendly treatment option with adequate onset of action and durable effect sufficient to break the seizure cluster and prevent recurrence. The market opportunity is estimated at ~$650-1.3B.
We have completed a Phase 1a and a Phase 1b single dose studies in healthy subjects vs. Diastat® which demonstrated Cmax comparable to and Tmax longer than Diastat®, comparable partial AUCs across early timepoints, increased overall exposure (AUC0-∞) when compared to Diastat®, and dose proportionality.  XP-0863 was safe and well-tolerated with minimal sedation, minimal injection site reactions and no serious adverse events. In addition to the orphan designation, the FDA has granted Fast Track designation and aligned on the proposed clinical development plan of a single Phase 3, single arm safety study in patients with epilepsy as well as a 505(b)(2) submission. A primary container and device partner has been identified to develop a pre-filled syringe 
and/or rescue autoinjector. We are currently seeking partners to license the development and commercialization rights to XP-0863 in the US. 
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture, assembly, testing, packaging, storage and distribution of our products. In our experience, third party contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") are generally cost-efficient, high quality and reliable, and we currently have no plans to build our own manufacturing or distribution infrastructure. Our technical team has extensive pharmaceutical development, manufacturing, analytical, quality and distribution experience and is qualified and capable of managing supply chain operations across multiple CMOs. Our Quality System, Standard Operating Procedures and CMO interfaces are designed to promote the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements ("CGMP") compliance and effective regulatory communications. We selected our CMOs for specific competencies, and they have met our development, manufacturing, quality and regulatory requirements and have all been involved in manufacturing our clinical supplies, commercial registration batches, and commercial product.
Glucagon is the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") used in Gvoke and our ready-to-use glucagon product candidates. Bachem Americas, Inc., ("Bachem") is our primary commercial source for API. Bachem holds a U.S. drug master file for glucagon produced at its facility in Switzerland, and its manufacturing process is fully validated. We have entered into a non-exclusive supply agreement with Bachem. While we believe that Bachem has sufficient capacity to satisfy our long-term glucagon API requirements for Gvoke and other ready-to-use glucagon product candidates, we are evaluating alternate sourcing options. 
Manufacturing drug product for Gvoke requires an aseptic fill/finish facility capable of handling solvents and a cyclic olefinic polymer syringe. Pyramid Laboratories, Inc. ("Pyramid") has been actively involved in the development of Gvoke and our ready-to-use glucagon product candidates. Its facility in California is our primary source for drug product. We have entered into a non-exclusive supply agreement with Pyramid. While we believe that Pyramid has sufficient capacity to satisfy our demand requirements for at least three to five years, we are evaluating alternate sourcing options.
The auto-injector used to deliver drug product in Gvoke HypoPen is a proprietary multi-product device platform developed by SHL Medical AG, SHL Pharma LLC, and SHL Pharma (collectively "SHL"). SHL produces device sub-assemblies as its facilities in Taiwan and performs final drug product/device assembly operations at its facility in Florida. We have entered into a non-exclusive supply agreement with SHL.
We have a supply agreement with Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. ("Taro") to produce Keveyis. The supply agreement may extend beyond the orphan exclusivity period unless terminated by either party pursuant to the terms of the agreement. If the supply agreement is terminated by Taro at the conclusion of the orphan exclusivity period, we have the right to manufacture the product on our own or have the product manufactured by a third party on our behalf.
Levoketoconazole is the API used in Recorlev. Regis Technologies, Inc. ("Regis”) has been actively involved in the development of levoketoconazole and its facility in Illinois is our sole source for API. We have entered into a supply agreement with Regis. We believe that Regis has sufficient capacity to satisfy our demand requirements for at least three to five years.
Manufacturing Recorlev drug product requires a conventional solid oral dosage form manufacturing facility. Xcelience, LLC. (“Lonza”) has been actively involved in the development of Recorlev and its facility in Florida is our sole source for drug product. We have entered into a supply agreement with Lonza. We believe that Lonza has sufficient capacity to satisfy our demand requirements for at least three to five years.
We believe that a number of CMOs can provide suitable secondary packaging services for Gvoke and Recorlev, and we have entered into commercial supply agreements with one vendor. A number of third-party logistic providers can provide commercial order processing and finished goods distribution services to U.S. specialty pharmacies and wholesale customers, and we have a commercial distribution agreement with one such vendor for Gvoke, Keveyis and Recorlev.
To date, we and our suppliers and third-party manufacturing partners have been able to continue to supply our products to our patients and currently do not anticipate any interruptions in supply. Our third-party contract manufacturing partners continue to operate at or near normal levels, with enhanced safety measures intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. While we currently do not anticipate any interruptions in our manufacturing process, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our third-party suppliers and contract manufacturing partners’ ability to supply and/or manufacture our products.
Competition
Our industry is characterized by intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our employees, product and product candidate platform, development expertise and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as more experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and the commercialization of those products.

< | Gvoke: Four emergency glucagon kits are currently available to treat severe hypoglycemia: Eli Lilly’s GEK, Novo Nordisk’s GlucaGen HypoKit, Fresenius Kabi's Glucagon Emergency Kit and Amphastar's generic Glucagon for Injection Emergency Kit. Each kit is sold as a vial of lyophilized, glucagon powder with an exposed syringe/needle that contains a liquid diluent. The glucagon powder must be combined with the liquid diluent at the time of use and drawn into a syringe in accordance with a complex multi-step reconstitution and dose calibration procedure. Additionally, once reconstituted, the glucagon must be used immediately. We believe that the drawbacks of traditional kits and the lack of conversations regarding glucagon limit their adoption. Three innovative glucagon products are currently available to treat severe hypoglycemia, including our Gvoke, Eli Lilly's intranasal glucagon dry powder, Baqsimi, and Zealand Pharma’s dasiglucagon auto-injector, Zegalogue. In our market research, respondents ranked the importance of successful full-dose delivery and ability to tell if the full dose was administered significantly higher than the attribute "needleless". Caregivers and people with diabetes associated Gvoke HypoPen with efficacious and successful dose delivery, as well as ease of ability to tell if the full dose was administered. Similarly, healthcare professionals indicated that one of the most appealing attributes of Gvoke is the greater likelihood of successful dose delivery. 
< | Keveyis: Keveyis is the first and only FDA approved therapy for PPP. Acetazolamide, an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is used frequently off-label for the prophylactic and sometimes acute treatment of PPP. Potassium supplements are indicated for use in hypokalemic periodic paralysis in the United States and are frequently used either chronically or for emergency treatment of episodes in the form of PPP. Several other types of drugs have been reported to have benefits for chronic or acute use in one or more than one PPP variant, including potassium-sparing diuretics, beta receptor agonists, mexelitine and other sodium channel blockers, and others. We are not aware of drugs currently in development for prophylactic chronic treatment of PPP. 
< | Recorlev: A number of therapies are currently approved or in various stages of development for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Currently, there are no therapies broadly marketed for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients in the U.S. Korlym (mifepristone) is indicated to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. Signifor (pasireotide) and Signifor LAR are marketed by Recordati in the United States and are indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing's disease (a subset of Cushing’s syndrome) for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative.

Intellectual Property
Proprietary Protection
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and product candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We have been building and continue to build our intellectual property portfolio relating to our product candidates and technology. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also intend to rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us or our partners in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
Patent Rights
We currently own 141 patents issued globally, including a composition of matter patent covering our ready-to-use glucagon formulation that expires in 2036. Upon completion of the acquisition of Strongbridge, we control the patents of Xeris Pharma and those of Strongbridge Dublin Limited, the latter of which has 53 granted patents globally including those related to proprietary formulations of levoketoconazole (the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Recorlev®) and the uses of such formulations in treating certain endocrine-related diseases and syndromes. This includes US Patent No. 11,020,393, which was granted on June 1, 2021, and which provides patent protection through 2040 for the use of Recorlev in the treatment of certain patients with persistent or recurrent Cushing’s syndrome.
Trade Secrets and Other Protection
In addition to patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our technology and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. The agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements generally also provide that we own all inventions conceived and/or reduced to practice by the individual in the course of their employment with us or rendering services to us.
Other Intellectual Property Rights
We file trademark applications and pursue registrations in the United States and abroad when appropriate. We own registered trademarks for the mark Xeris Pharmaceuticals in the U.S., for the marks GVOKE, GVOKE HYPOPEN and HYPOPEN in the US and several ex-US countries, the registered trademark for OGLUO in the EU and the UK, and the registered trademarks for XERISOL and XERIJECT in Australia, the EU and the UK. We also own pending trademark applications for XERISOL and XERIJECT in the U.S. and a number of ex-US countries, and for the marks GVOKE and GVOKE HYPOPEN in a number of ex-U.S. countries, all for use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development and products, as well as trade names that could be used with our product candidates. 
From time to time, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third-party intellectual property holders.
Regulation
Government Regulation
United States Drug and Biological Product Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs, medical devices and combinations of drugs and devices, or combination products, under the FDCA and its implementing regulations and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act ("PHSA") and their implementing regulations. Drugs, biologics, medical devices and combination products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, requests for voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Certain of our products and product candidates are subject to regulation as combination products, which means that they are composed of both a drug product and device product. If our drug products, along with our combination product, marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of Gvoke and some of our product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, or biological component of the product, which means that the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research ("CDER") or FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ("CBER") has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of the combination product. Accordingly, we plan to continue to investigate our products through the IND framework and seek approval through the NDA or BLA pathway. Based on our discussions with the FDA to date, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require a separate medical device authorization for the device component of our combination products, but this could change during the course of its review of any marketing application that we may submit. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

< | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice ("GLP") regulations; 
< | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
< | approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB"), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
< | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with an applicable IND and other clinical study related regulations, sometimes referred to as FDA's Clinical Practices ("GCPs") regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its proposed indication;
< | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; 
< | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s CGMP regulations; 
< | potential FDA inspection of Xeris, the clinical trial sites, or other vendors that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; 
< | payment of associated user fees; 
< | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
< | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale; and 
< | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 

Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation, and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance and may be imposed on all drug or biological products within a certain class of drugs or biologics. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical trials of a certain duration or for a certain dose.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Further, an IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trial are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

< | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients.
< | Phase 2. Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. 
< | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the 
FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. Companies that conduct certain clinical trials are also required to register them and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, such as ClinicalTrials.gov in the United States, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the product, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk to human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical trial sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with CGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. In addition, for certain combination products it may be necessary to conduct Human Factors studies prior to NDA or BLA submission to ascertain the usability of the product by patients in real-world settings.
FDA Review Process
The results of product development, preclinical studies, Human Factors studies (when required), and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biologic, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, requesting approval to market the product. An NDA for a new drug must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy. A BLA is a request for approval to market a biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the biologic’s safety, purity, and potency. Under federal law, most NDAs or BLAs must be accompanied by a significant application user fee to the FDA. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA or BLA. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses which we utilized for Gvoke.
The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA typically makes a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. The decision to accept the NDA or BLA for filing means that the FDA has made a threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), the FDA’s goal to complete its substantive review and respond to the applicant is ten months from the receipt of a standard NDA or ten months from the filing date of an NDA for a new molecular entity or original BLA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and may go through multiple review cycles.
After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with CGMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA or BLA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with CGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with CGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process, and manufacturing 
facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a product for marketing in the United States, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA or BLA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 clinical trials to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
NDAs for most new drug products are based on at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical studies and must contain substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is authorized, however, to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”
Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternative and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug ("RLD").
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is the same as the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to an RLD if the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the RLD. Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic 
equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity ("NCE") is a drug that contains no active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance, that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, which states that the proposed drug will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
Pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight (8) months for a drug that has three (3) or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of ‘‘competitive generic therapies’’ or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application.
Marketing Exclusivity for Biological Products 
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCI Act"). This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. 
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. ‘‘First licensure’’ typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. 
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
Upon approval of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant relies on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

< | the required patent information has not been filed; 
< | the listed patent has expired; 
< | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
< | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not provide a Paragraph IV certification against the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or the 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.
Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products may be comprised of components, such as drug components and device components, that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:
< | a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; 
< | two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; 
< | a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
< | any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect. 

Under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for combination products, although it does not preclude consultations by the lead center with other components of FDA. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA also has established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
A combination product with a drug primary mode of action generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes under the FDCA. In reviewing the NDA or 505(b)(2) application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the drug center could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA regulations, combination products are subject to CGMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the Quality System ("QS") regulations applicable to medical devices.
Drug-device combination products present unique challenges for competitors seeking approval of an ANDA for generic versions of combination products. Generally, FDA reviews both the drug and device constituents of a proposed generic product to determine whether it is the same as the innovator product, including whether the basic design and operating principles of the device component 
are the same and whether minor differences require significant differences in labeling for safe and effective use. If FDA determines that the device component of the proposed generic product is not the same in terms of performance and critical design, or that the labeling is not the same, it generally will not approve the ANDA. Likewise, if FDA determines that certain clinical studies, such as clinical usability or human factors studies, are necessary to demonstrate the safety and/or effectiveness of the device component, FDA generally will not accept or approve an ANDA for a combination product and will instead require the submission of a full NDA or 505(b)(2) application.

Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse events with the product, providing the applicable regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, and product sampling and distribution requirements in accordance with the Prescription Drug Marketing Act ("PDMA"), a part of the FDCA, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act ("DSCSA"). The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCSA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. Moreover, each component of a combination product retains its regulatory status (as a drug or device, for example) and is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
Prescription drug and biologic advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug and biologic promotion and advertising, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. In addition, a pharmaceutical company must comply with restrictions on promoting drugs and biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s or biologic's approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs or biologics for off-label uses, manufacturers are prohibited from marketing or promoting such off-label uses.
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that combination products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with CGMPs applicable to drugs, biologics and devices, including certain QS requirements. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with CGMP regulations. CGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from CGMP. Drug and biologics manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with CGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain CGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA or BLA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to CGMPs, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing or REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development and impact approved products already on the market.
Other Regulatory Matters
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, voluntary recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, 
exclusion from federal healthcare programs, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the voluntary recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Alternatively, orphan drug designation may be available if the disease or the condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different conditions. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product with the same drug for the same condition under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of persons with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan ("PSP") within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The requirements for pediatric data generally do not apply to drugs or biologics for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent five-year and three-year and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA or BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of FDA-requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
Expedited Review and Approval Programs
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for that disease or condition. For a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider sections of the NDA or BLA for 
review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. In October 2020, we were granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for our novel formulation of diazepam.
A product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA generally sets the target date for FDA action on the NDA or BLA that is subject to PDUFA goals at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing, or for drugs that are not new chemical entities, six months after the FDA receives the application. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA PDUFA review period of ten months after the FDA accepts the application for filing, or for drugs that are not new chemical entities, ten months after FDA receives the application. Priority review designation does not change the scientific or medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA or BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after regulatory approvals are generally required to verify the drug or biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. Drugs or biologics granted accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the product sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies, or if such post-marketing studies fail to verify a clinical benefit.
The FDA also may designate a product candidate as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which also can be granted to the same drug or biologic if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such product.
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Regulations and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
In order to market any product outside the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the EU generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of pharmaceutical development, preclinical studies, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities for clinical trials authorization and to the EMA for an MAA and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU. Similar requirements are necessary to conduct clinical trials in the United Kingdom, with the submission of an MAA to the CHMP for marketing authorization.
Clinical Trial Approval 
In April 2014, the EU adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (CTR), which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive. The CTR entered into application on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the CTR offer sponsors the possibility to choose between the requirements of the previous Clinical Trials Directive and the CTR if the request for authorization of a clinical trial is submitted in the year after the CTR became applicable. If the sponsor chooses to submit under the Clinical Trials Directive, the clinical trial continues to be governed by the Clinical Trial Directive until three years after the CTR became applicable. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years after the CTR became applicable, the CTR will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The CTR overhauls the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation, which is directly applicable in all EU Member States (meaning no national implementing legislation in each Member State is required), aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. For instance, the CTR provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. Parties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the EU at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu. 
Marketing Authorization 
To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid throughout the EU, and in the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines), and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product and for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who makes the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
National marketing authorizations, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EU, this national authorization can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national authorization in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. 
Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to marketing authorizations approved in EU Member States through decentralized or mutual recognition procedures with a view to more quickly granting a marketing authorization in the UK or Great Britain.
Data and Market Exclusivity
In the EU, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity, if granted, prevents applicants for authorization of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MAA can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products ("COMP") grants orphan designation to promote the development of products that: (1) are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition: (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary 
investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of such condition has been authorized for marketing in the EU or, if such method exists, the product would be of a significant benefit to those affected by that condition. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization.
In the EU, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. During the ten-year market exclusivity period, the EMA cannot accept an MAA, or grant a marketing authorization, or accept an application to extend a marketing authorization, for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a “similar medicinal product”. A “ similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity would not prevent the approval of a similar medicinal product that is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.
Regulation of Combination Products
The EU regulates medical devices and medicinal products separately, through different legislative instruments, and the applicable requirements will vary depending on the type of drug-device combination product. EU guidance has been published to help manufacturers select the right regulatory framework. In the case of drug-delivery products intended to administer a medicinal product where the device and the medicinal product do not form a single integral product, the medicinal product is regulated in accordance with the aforementioned rules while the device part is regulated as a medical device and will have to comply with all the requirements set by Regulation 2017/745, or the Medical Devices Regulation (which became applicable on 26 May 2021 and repealed the EU Council Directive 93/42/EEC, or the Medical Devices Directive). Where the medical device and medicinal product form a single integrated product (e.g. pre-filled inhalers), if the principal intended action is achieved by the medicine, the product is considered a medicinal product that includes a medical device and the entire product is regulated under the EU pharmaceutical legislation. However, the MAA for the product should include a CE certificate for the device in accordance with the Medical Devices Regulation or, if not CE marked but would need to be certified if marketed separately, the applicant must include an opinion from a notified body on conformity of device (except for Class I devices). This is a requirement under the new Medical Devices Regulation. 
The characteristics of non-integral devices used for the administration of medicinal products may impact the quality, safety and efficacy profile of the medicinal products. To the extent that administration devices are co-packaged with the medicinal product or, in exceptional cases, where the use of a specific type of administration device is specifically provided for in the product information of the medicinal product, additional information may need to be provided in the MA application for the medicinal product on the characteristics of the medical device(s) that may impact on the quality, safety and/or efficacy of the medicinal product. The requirements regarding quality aspects for integral drug-device combination products, including devices that are co-packaged with medicinal products, are outlined in an EMA guideline which came into effect on January 1, 2022. 
The EU requires that all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I of the Medical Devices Regulation. The most fundamental requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Regulation, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product, and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body. Notified Bodies are independent organizations designated by EU countries to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance requirements, the Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. 
As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the general safety and performance requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. There was a transition period during which EU pharmaceutical laws continued to apply to the UK, which 
expired on December 31, 2020. However, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. Although we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors for our products, we are subject to broadly applicable healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal and state governments, which could significantly impact our business. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), the Department of Justice ("DOJ"), the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA"), the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Occupational Safety & Health Administration ("OSHA"), the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), and state and local governments. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business as well as in foreign jurisdictions in which we may conduct trials or where we may otherwise be subject to local regulation. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

< | Anti-Kickback Statute ("AKS"). The federal AKS makes it illegal for any person or entity (including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or intended to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, prescription or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, they are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the AKS without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. Violations of the AKS carry potentially significant civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, administrative civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare program;
< | The federal civil and criminal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal False Claims Act ("FCA"), prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Companies that submit claims directly to payors also may be liable under the FCA for the direct submission of such claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs; 
< | the anti-inducement law prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program; 


< | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ("HITECH") and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities, that perform services for them that involve the creation, maintenance, receipt, use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there may be additional federal, state and non-U.S. laws which govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
< | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
< | the federal transparency requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to HHS information regarding any payment or other “transfer of value” made or distributed to healthcare professionals (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the healthcare professionals and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. 
< | federal price reporting laws, which require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; 
< | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and 
< | The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make, improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment. 

Additionally, we may be subject to state and non-U.S. equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements, and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and non-U.S. laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.
Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices, including our arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers, some 
of whom receive stock options as compensation for services provided, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of our drug candidates outside the United States also will likely subject us to non-U.S. equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other non-U.S. laws.
If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which also may adversely affect our business.
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
In the U.S., to help patients afford our approved product, we may utilize programs to assist them, including patient assistance programs (PAPs) and co-pay coupon programs for eligible patients. PAPs are regulated by and subject to guidance from CMS OIG. In addition, at least one insurer has directed its network pharmacies to no longer accept co-pay coupons for certain specialty drugs the insurer identified. Our co-pay coupon programs could become the target of similar insurer actions. In addition, in November 2013, the CMS issued guidance to the issuers of qualified health plans sold through the ACA’s marketplaces encouraging such plans to reject patient cost-sharing support from third parties and indicating that the CMS intends to monitor the provision of such support and may take regulatory action to limit it in the future. The CMS subsequently issued a rule requiring individual market qualified health plans to accept third-party premium and cost-sharing payments from certain government-related entities. In September 2014, the OIG of the HHS issued a Special Advisory Bulletin warning manufacturers that they may be subject to sanctions under the federal anti-kickback statute and/or civil monetary penalty laws if they do not take appropriate steps to exclude Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. Accordingly, companies exclude these Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. 
On December 2, 2020, the HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between PBMs and manufacturers. Implementation of this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and PBM service fees are currently under review by the current U.S. presidential administration and may be amended or repealed. Further, on December 31, 2020, CMS published a new rule, effective January 1, 2023, requiring manufacturers to ensure the full value of co-pay assistance is passed on to the patient or these dollars will count toward the Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price calculation of the drug. On May 21, 2021, PhRMA sued the HHS in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, to stop the implementation of the rule claiming that the rule contradicts federal law surrounding Medicaid rebates. It is unclear how the outcome of this litigation will affect the rule. We cannot predict how the implementation of and any further changes to this rule will affect our business.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted in the United States. The ACA includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are that the ACA:

< | Made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs to 23.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. 
< | Imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 70% (increased pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”) as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D. 
< | Extended a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations. 
< | Expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program. 
< | Established a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected. 
< | Imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs. 
< | Established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.

Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business. Prior to the Biden administration, on October 13, 2017, former President Trump signed an Executive Order which terminated the cost sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. The former Trump administration concluded that cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies required under the ACA have not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it will discontinue these payments immediately until those appropriations are made. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. On August 14, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in two separate cases that the federal government is liable for the full amount of unpaid CSRs for the years preceding and including 2017. For CSR claims made by health insurance companies for years 2018 and later, further litigation will be required to determine the amounts due, if any. Further, on June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued the payments were owed to them. On April 27, 2020, the United States Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s decision and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, concluding the government has an obligation to pay these risk corridor payments under the relevant formula. It is unclear what impact these rulings will have on our business.
In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:

< | On August 2, 2011, the U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022. 
< | On January 2, 2013, the U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers. 
< | On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. 
< | On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
< | On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. 
< | On December 20, 2019 former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future. 

There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At a federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that additional foreign, federal and state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products or product candidates, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our products or product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
In addition, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular pharmaceutical drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the pharmaceutical drug product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical drug products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive clinical trials in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such product, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ("ACA") contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ("MMA") established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
In addition, there have been several changes to the 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities. On December 27, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated a reimbursement formula change under the 340B drug pricing program, and CMS subsequently altered the FYs 2019 and 2018 reimbursement formula on specified covered outpatient drugs (“SCODs”). The court ruled this change was not an “adjustment” which was within the Secretary’s discretion to make but was instead a fundamental change in the reimbursement calculation. However, most recently, on July 31, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the district court’s decision and found that the changes were within the Secretary’s authority. On September 14, 2020, the plaintiffs-appellees filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc (i.e., before the full court), but was denied on October 16, 2020. Plaintiffs-appellees filed a petition for a writ of certiorari at the Supreme Court on February 10, 2021. On Friday July 2, 2021, the Supreme Court granted the petition. It is unclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products in the future, if any.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drugs, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial. It also is possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our drugs after approval. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis. 
These laws and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our products or product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product is prescribed or used.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. We expect that an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more of our products or product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Outside the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices likely will continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 294 full-time employees in the United States, 164 of whom were primarily engaged in sales and marketing, 85 of whom were primarily engaged in general administration, and 45 of whom were primarily engaged in product development and research.
We believe our success will depend on, among other things, our ability to continue to hire and retain the necessary qualified personnel across all departments in our organization, as we expand the commercialization of our products. Our President and Chief Operating Officer and Vice President, Human Resources are responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This includes the attraction, acquisition, development and engagement of talent to deliver on the Company’s strategy. the executive management team regularly updates our board of directors and its committees on the operation and status of our human capital trends and activities.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to building a company that provides an inclusive environment where we invite and encourage diverse perspectives, ideas, and people. With that goal in mind, we have established a committee comprised of employees and sponsored by key executive team members to build a strategy designed to promote a diverse and inclusive work environment. We believe these initiatives and a workforce with diverse backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints will continue to bring innovative solutions to the Company. In addition, we have sought to implement recruiting practices and to work with recruiting partners who can help us best identify and attract diverse candidates. We continue to expand our systems to track key human capital metrics such as demographics, diversity, compensation and benefits, and engagement and to think of new ways to best support our female and underrepresented employees to help advance their careers. 
Training and Talent Development
We believe that our employees are the key to our success, and we believe their development is what drives our growth and prosperity as a company. To support employee development, as well as plan for short and long term business success, we review and update a company succession plan regularly and we offer a number of development opportunities for our employees through various methods. Our succession plan is reviewed with the board annually. In addition, upon joining the company, all new employees are required to become familiar with our policies, including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Employee Handbook, and complete compliance training, and existing employees are required to acknowledge current policies annually.
Compensation and Benefits
An important part of attracting and retaining key talent is competitive pay and benefits. To ensure our compensation and benefits programs are competitive, we engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry. Our pay for 
performance philosophy seeks to motivate and reward employees while accomplishing the Company’s short and long-term strategic goals. As part of a robust performance management process, employees are evaluated both on what they accomplished and how they demonstrated our values. Annual salary increases and incentive bonuses are based on both individual and corporate performance factors.
As a long-term incentive, to encourage our employees to think like owners and share in the Company’s long-term success, employees are granted equity in the form of stock options or restricted stock units and can elect to participate in our employee stock purchase plan. Employees are generally eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves including paid parental leave, paid caregiver leave, retirement plans with an employer contribution match, life and disability/accident coverage, parking or commuter assistance, an employee assistance program providing mental health, legal and financial health resources, and access to convenient COVID-19 testing.
Health and Safety
We are committed to the safety of our employees and the communities we serve. We provide regular health and safety training programs for employees, which includes, upon on-boarding, an overview during new hire orientation, as well as ongoing training throughout the year.. Employees are trained on workplace safety, including security and inspection, work related injuries and emergency protocols as applicable for their role and work location. In addition, special health and safety training is conducted for laboratory staff.
Also, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly implemented policies to protect our employees and provide solutions to enable our employees to manage their work and personal responsibilities. In addition, a Pandemic Response Team was established, comprised of senior leaders, to help guide and direct activities associated with local governance and business requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to "Impact of COVID-19" included in Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information on Human Capital Management actions taken by the Company in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
