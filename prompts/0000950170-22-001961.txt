Item 1. Business
Our Company
 Through our predecessor companies, we have been in the equipment services business for approximately 60 years. H&E Equipment Services L.L.C. was formed in June 2002 through the combination of Head & Engquist Equipment, LLC (“Head & Engquist”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gulf Wide Industries, L.L.C. (“Gulf Wide”), and ICM Equipment Company L.L.C. (“ICM”). Head & Engquist, founded in 1961, and ICM, founded in 1971, were two leading regional, integrated equipment service companies operating in contiguous geographic markets. In the June 2002 transaction, Head & Engquist and ICM were merged with and into Gulf Wide, which was renamed H&E Equipment Services L.L.C. (“H&E LLC”). In connection with our initial public offering in February 2006, we converted H&E LLC into H&E Equipment Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
We are one of the largest rental equipment companies in the nation. The Company’s fleet is among the industry’s youngest and most versatile with a superior equipment mix comprised of aerial work platforms, earthmoving, material handling, and other general and specialty lines. H&E serves a diverse set of end markets in many high-growth geographies including branches throughout the Pacific Northwest, West Coast, Intermountain, Southwest, Gulf Coast States, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic regions. We engage in five principal business activities in these equipment categories:
 •equipment rentals;
 •used equipment sales;
 •new equipment sales;
 •parts sales; and
 •repair and maintenance services.
 By historically providing rental, sales, parts, repair and maintenance functions under one roof, we offered our customers a one-stop solution for their equipment needs. This full-service approach provided us with (1) multiple points of customer contact; (2) cross-selling opportunities among our rental, used and new equipment sales, parts sales and services operations; (3) an effective method to manage our rental fleet through efficient maintenance and profitable distribution of used equipment; and (4) a mix of business activities that enabled us to operate effectively throughout economic cycles. We believe that the operating experience and extensive infrastructure we developed throughout our history as an integrated equipment services company provides us with a competitive advantage to broaden our industry expansion and successfully transition to a pure-play rental company.
We have built an extensive infrastructure that as of December 31, 2021 includes 102 full-service facilities located in 24 states throughout the United States. Our workforce includes distinct and focused sales forces for our rental operations and used and new equipment sales, highly skilled service technicians, product specialists, and regional and district managers. Our management, from the corporate level down to the branch store level, has extensive industry experience. We focus our rental and sales activities on, and organize our personnel principally by, our core equipment categories (aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment, material handling equipment and other general and specialty equipment lines). We believe this allows us to provide specialized equipment knowledge, improve the effectiveness of our rental and sales forces and strengthen our customer relationships. In addition, we operate our day-to-day business on a branch basis, which we believe allows us to more closely service our customers, fosters management accountability at local levels and strengthens our local and regional relationships.
 Industry Background
 Although there has been some consolidation within the industry over a number of years, including the acquisitions of Rental Services Corporation, NES Rentals and Neff Corporation by United Rentals, Inc. (“URI”), the U.S. construction equipment distribution and rental industry remains highly fragmented and consists mainly of a small number of multi-location regional or national operators and a large number of relatively small, independent businesses serving discrete local markets. The industry is driven by a broad range of economic factors including total U.S. non-residential construction trends, construction machinery demand, demand for rental equipment and additional, region-specific factors. Construction equipment is largely distributed to end users through two channels: equipment rental companies and equipment dealers. Examples of equipment rental companies include URI, Sunbelt Rentals, and Herc Rentals. Examples of equipment dealers include Finning and Toromont. Historically, we operated substantially in both channels, but we have taken steps to transition to operate as a pure rental company. Many pure equipment rental companies also provide parts and service support to customers.
Products and Services
 Equipment Rentals. We rent our construction equipment to our customers on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. We have a well-maintained rental fleet that, at December 31, 2021, consisted of approximately 42,725 pieces of equipment having an original acquisition cost (which we define as the cost originally paid to manufacturers or the original amount financed under operating leases) of approximately $1.9 billion and an average age of approximately 40.3 months.
 Used Equipment Sales. We sell used equipment primarily from our rental fleet, as well as inventoried equipment that we acquire through trade-ins from our customers and selective purchases of high-quality used equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 94.6% of our used equipment sales revenues were derived from sales of rental fleet equipment. Used equipment sales often generate additional customers for our parts and services business.
 New Equipment Sales. We sell new construction equipment, primarily in our earthmoving product category, and are a leading U.S. distributor for nationally recognized suppliers including Komatsu, Takeuchi, JLG Industries, Gehl, and Genie Industries (Terex). We have a retail sales force that is separate from our rental sales force. Our new equipment sales operation is a source of new customers for our parts sales and service support activities.
 Parts Sales. We provide parts to our own rental fleet and sell parts to customers for the equipment we sell. We maintain a parts inventory in order to provide timely parts and service support to our own rental fleet as well as to our customers. In addition, our parts operations enable us to maintain a high-quality rental fleet and provide additional product support to our end users.
Service Support. We provide maintenance and repair services to our own rental fleet and for our customers’ owned equipment. In addition to repair and maintenance on an as-needed or scheduled basis, we provide ongoing preventative maintenance services. We devote resources to training our technical service employees and over time, we have built a full-scale services infrastructure that we believe would be difficult for companies without the requisite resources and lead time to effectively replicate.
 In addition to our principal business activities mentioned above, we provide ancillary equipment support activities including transportation, hauling, parts shipping and loss damage waivers.
 Sales and Marketing
 We have sales forces which specialize in equipment rentals and equipment sales. To further develop knowledge and experience, we provide our sales forces with extensive training, including frequent factory and in-house training by manufacturer representatives regarding the operational features, operator safety training and maintenance of new equipment. This training is essential, as our sales personnel regularly call on customers’ job sites, often assisting customers in assessing their immediate and ongoing equipment needs. In addition, we have a commission-based compensation program for our sales forces.
 We maintain a proprietary customer relationship management system. We believe that this comprehensive customer and sales management tool enhances our regional territory operations by increasing the productivity and efficiency of our sales representatives and sales managers as they are provided real-time access to critical jobsite information. We are partnered with some of the world’s most advanced data information companies to assure our industry data is complete.
 We have developed strategies to identify target customers for equipment rentals in all markets. These strategies allow our sales force to identify frequent rental users, function as advisors and problem solvers for our customers, and accelerate the sales process in new operations.
 While our specialized, well-trained sales force strengthens our customer relationships and fosters customer loyalty, we also promote our business through marketing and advertising, including digital marketing, direct mail campaigns, select industry publications and associations, and our Company website at www.he-equipment.com.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 Integrated Platform of Equipment, Products and Services. We believe that our operating experience and the extensive infrastructure we have developed through years of operating as both an equipment rental company and equipment distributor provides us with a competitive advantage to broaden our industry expansion and successfully transition to a primarily rental-focused company. Key strengths of ours include:
 •the ability to provide premium brands and a comprehensive line of equipment and services, allowing us to strengthen customer relationships and be a single-source solution for our customers;
 •the ability to track utilization and facilitate the transfer of our fleet across multiple locations to adjust to local customer demand;


•high quality rental fleet supported by our strong product support capabilities;
 •established retail sales network resulting in the profitable disposal of our used equipment; 
 •purchasing power gained through purchases for our rental operations fleet and new equipment sales; 
 •operational cost efficiencies across our organization, including with respect to purchasing, information technology, back-office support and marketing; and
 •mix of business activities that enables us to effectively operate through economic cycles.
 High-Quality, Multipurpose Fleet. Our equipment fleet represents a significant investment and reflects our commitment to providing an array of rental equipment to our customers in a variety of industries. Our focus on our core types of construction equipment allows us to better provide the specialized knowledge and support that our customers demand when renting and purchasing equipment. These core types of equipment are attractive because they have a long useful life, high residual value and generally strong industry demand.
 Diverse Customer Markets. We provide equipment rental services to customers in a wide variety of markets, including commercial and residential construction, industrial, infrastructure, and other industries. We believe that the diversification of our customer base reduces our end-market exposure to any one particular market.
 Complementary Parts and Services Segments. Our parts and services businesses allow us to maintain our rental fleet in excellent condition and to offer our customers high-quality rental equipment.
Well-Developed Infrastructure. We have built an infrastructure that as of December 31, 2021 included a network of 102 full-service facilities in 24 states. Our workforce included, as of December 31, 2021, a highly-skilled group of approximately 496 service technicians and an aggregate of 275 sales people in our specialized rental and equipment sales forces. We believe that our well-developed infrastructure helps us to better serve large multi-regional customers and provides an advantage when competing for lucrative fleet and project management business as well as the ability to quickly capitalize on new opportunities.
 Strong Supplier Relationships. We have longstanding relationships with nationally-recognized equipment suppliers, including JLG Industries, Gehl, Genie Industries (Terex), Komatsu, Takeuchi, JCB, John Deere, Yanmar and Case. These relationships improve our ability to negotiate equipment acquisition pricing and allow us to purchase parts at wholesale costs.
 Customized Information Technology Systems. Our information systems allow us to actively manage our business and our rental fleet. We have a customer relationship management system that provides our sales force with real-time access to customer and sales information. We are expanding the utilization of our automated digital customer platform which offers comprehensive self-service capabilities allowing customers to reserve equipment, schedule delivery, make payments and access customer support. In addition, our enterprise resource planning system enhances our ability to provide more timely and meaningful information to manage our business.
 Strong Customer Relationships. We have a diverse base of approximately 45,400 customers as of December 31, 2021 who we believe value our high level of service, knowledge and expertise. Our customer base includes a wide range of industrial and commercial companies, construction contractors, manufacturers, public utilities, municipalities, maintenance contractors and numerous and diverse other large industrial accounts. Our branches enable us to closely service local and regional customers, while our infrastructure enables us to effectively service multi-regional and national accounts. We believe that our expansive presence and commitment to superior service at all levels of the organization is a key differentiator to many of our competitors. As a result, we spend a significant amount of time and resources to train all key personnel to be responsive and deliver high quality customer service and well-maintained equipment so that we can maintain and grow our customer relationships.
 Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team is led by Bradley W. Barber, our Chief Executive Officer, who has over 27 years of industry experience. Our senior and regional managers have approximately 26 years on average of industry experience. Our branch managers have extensive knowledge and industry experience as well.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our business strategy includes, among other things, managing the life cycle of our rental equipment, expanding our rental product offerings, increasing the availability of our product offerings through branch expansion and pursuing selective acquisitions. However, the timing and extent to which we implement these various aspects of our strategy depend on a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control, such as general economic conditions and construction activity in the U.S.


Managing the Life Cycle of Our Rental Equipment. We actively manage the size, quality, age and composition of our rental fleet, employing a “cradle through grave” approach. During the life of our rental equipment, we (1) aggressively negotiate on purchase price; (2) use our customized information technology systems to closely monitor and analyze, among other things, time utilization (equipment usage based on customer demand), rental rate trends and pricing optimization and equipment demand; (3) continuously adjust our fleet mix and pricing; (4) maintain fleet quality through quality control inspections and our on-site parts and services support; and (5) dispose of rental equipment through our retail sales force. This allows us to purchase our rental equipment at competitive prices, optimally utilize our fleet, cost-effectively maintain our equipment quality and maximize the value of our equipment at the end of its useful life.
 Expanding our Rental Product Offerings. We intend to expand our product offerings to customers by offering specialty rental product solutions. Recently, we introduced trench safety product solutions in selected markets. It is our intention to expand these specialty rental offerings throughout our geographic footprint. Specialty rental product offerings typically provide higher margin opportunities than general rental products.
 Increasing the Availability of our Product Offerings through Branch Expansion. We intend to expand our network of branch locations, thereby increasing the availability of rental products to our customers to meet their specific needs. Our branch expansion strategy focuses on expanding in markets where we have a presence and benefit from name and brand recognition. Expanding our branch network allows us to grow our margins and improve Company profitability through revenue mix and by leveraging our fixed costs.
 Executing Strategic Divestitures. We intend to transition to a pure-play rental company from our historical operation as an integrated equipment services company. We are focused on growing our rental business through the strategic divestitures of some of our existing distribution channels. We completed two divestitures during the year ended December 31, 2021. On September 17, 2021, the Company sold our Little Rock, Arkansas and Springdale, Arkansas owned-branches to Bramco, Inc. for $9.0 million and relinquished our related territory distribution rights with equipment manufacturers Komatsu, Wirtgen Group and Takeuchi. Effective October 1, 2021, the Company sold its crane business to a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Manitowoc Company, Inc. for $130 million in cash. The Crane Sale represents the Company’s strategic shift to a pure-play rental business and qualified for discontinued operations accounting treatment.
 Pursuing Selective Acquisitions. We intend to continue to evaluate and pursue, on an opportunistic basis, acquisitions that meet our selection criteria, including favorable financing terms, with the objective of increasing our revenues, improving our profitability, and strengthening our competitive position. We are focused on identifying and acquiring rental companies, including general rental and specialty rental companies, to complement our existing business, broaden our geographic footprint, and increase our density in existing markets, as well enter new markets where feasible expansion opportunities may exist. Growth through acquisitions allows us to leverage our fixed costs and grow profitability. We have completed three acquisitions over the last three years. Effective January 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Contractors Equipment Center, LLC (“CEC”), an equipment rental company serving the greater Denver, Colorado area with three branch locations, for approximately $132.4 million in cash. Effective April 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rental Inc., an equipment rental company with five branch locations in Alabama and Florida, for approximately $68.6 million in cash. Effective February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Cobra Equipment Rentals, LLC, dba We-Rent-It (“WRI”), a central Texas based non-residential construction-focused equipment rental company with six branch locations for approximately $107.9 million in cash.
Customers
 We serve approximately 45,400 customers in the United States, primarily in the Pacific Northwest, West Coast, Intermountain, Southwest, Gulf Coast States, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic regions. Our customers include a wide range of industrial and commercial companies, construction contractors, manufacturers, public utilities, municipalities, maintenance contractors and numerous and diverse other large industrial accounts. They vary from individuals to large contractors and industrial and commercial companies who typically operate under equipment and maintenance budgets. Our branches enable us to closely service local and regional customers, while our infrastructure enables us to effectively service multi-regional and national accounts. Our integrated strategy enables us to satisfy customer requirements and increase revenues from customers through cross-selling opportunities presented by the various products and services that we offer. As a result, our five reporting segments generally derive their revenue from the same customer base. In 2021, our largest customer accounted for approximately 1.1% of our total revenues. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue on an operating segment or consolidated basis in 2021. Our top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 5.3% of our total revenues in 2021.
Suppliers
 We purchase a significant amount of equipment from leading, nationally-known original equipment manufacturers. We purchased approximately 46.3% of our rental fleet and new equipment from five manufacturers (Komatsu, John Deere, Genie Industries (Terex),

JCB, and Skyjack) during the year ended December 31, 2021. These relationships improve our ability to negotiate equipment acquisition pricing. Additionally, we also purchase equipment from nationally-recognized equipment suppliers including JLG Industries, Gehl, Yanmar, Case and Takeuchi. While we believe that we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment we purchase in each of our principal product categories, termination of one or more of our relationships with any of our major suppliers of equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations if we were unable to obtain adequate or timely rental and sales equipment.
Competition
 The equipment industry is generally comprised of either pure rental equipment companies or manufacturer dealer/distributorship companies. We are historically an integrated equipment services company and rent, sell and provide parts and services support. Although there has been some consolidation within the equipment industry in recent years, the equipment industry remains highly fragmented and consists mainly of a small number of multi-location regional or national operators and a large number of relatively small, independent businesses serving discrete local markets. Many of the markets in which we operate are served by numerous competitors, ranging from national and multi-regional equipment rental companies (for example, URI, Sunbelt Rentals and Herc Rentals) or equipment dealers (for example, Finning and Toromont) to small, independent businesses with a limited number of locations.
 We believe that participants in the equipment rental industry generally compete on the basis of availability, quality, reliability, delivery and price. In general, large operators enjoy substantial competitive advantages over small, independent rental businesses due to a distinct price advantage. Many rental equipment companies’ parts and services offerings are limited and may prove difficult to expand due to the training, infrastructure and management resources necessary to develop the breadth of service offerings and depth of knowledge our service technicians are able to provide. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do.
 Traditionally, equipment manufacturers distributed their equipment and parts through a network of independent dealers with distribution agreements. As a result of consolidation and competition, both manufacturers and distributors sought to streamline their operations, improve their costs and gain market share. Our established, integrated infrastructure enables us to compete directly with our competitors on either a local, regional or national basis. We believe customers place greater emphasis on value-added services, teaming with equipment rental and sales companies who can meet all of their equipment, parts and services needs.
 Seasonality
 Although our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality, the demand for our rental equipment tends to be lower in the winter months. The level of equipment rental activities is directly related to commercial and industrial construction and maintenance activities. Therefore, equipment rental performance will be correlated to the levels of current construction activities. The severity of weather conditions can have a temporary impact on the level of construction activities.
 Equipment sales cycles are also subject to some seasonality with the peak selling period occurring during the spring season and extending through the summer. Parts and services activities are less affected by changes in demand caused by seasonality.
 Environmental and Safety Regulations
 Our facilities and operations are subject to comprehensive and frequently changing federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws. These laws regulate (1) the handling, storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and, if any, the associated cleanup of properties affected by pollutants; (2) air quality (emissions); and (3) wastewater. While our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks, we use petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous substances for fueling and maintaining our equipment and vehicles. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. We do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or competitive position as a result of our efforts to comply with such requirements.
In the future, federal, state or local governments could enact new or more stringent laws or issue new or more stringent regulations concerning environmental and worker health and safety matters, reporting and disclosure obligations, or effect a change in their enforcement of existing laws or regulations, that could affect our operations and increase our operational and compliance expenditures. Also, in the future, contamination may be found to exist at our facilities or off-site locations where we have sent wastes. There can be no assurance that we, or various environmental regulatory agencies, will not discover previously unknown environmental non-compliance or contamination. We could be held liable for such newly-discovered non-compliance or contamination. It is possible that changes in environmental and worker health and safety laws or liabilities from newly-discovered non-compliance or contamination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Human Capital
 H&E’s operating philosophy is that our growth and continued success are the result of management and employees working together in a spirit of cooperation and teamwork. Our core values emphasize an environment where safety, diversity, inclusion, talent development, training and retention, and corporate responsibility are top priorities. We believe this has enabled us to meet various challenges over the years, and the progress that has been achieved by us reflects this strong mutual commitment between the Company and its employees. We believe our employees are our greatest asset. We remain focused on furnishing friendly and safe working conditions, providing competitive pay and offering quality benefits, and producing revenue for the continued growth of the Company and the communities in which we operate, with an emphasis on the welfare of our employees and their families. We realize our success is a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our employees. Each employee at H&E is a contributing partner in our future growth and we strive to maintain a mutually beneficial workplace culture that also fosters the professional development of each employee. Some of these core values are further described below.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,157 employees. Of these employees, 796 are salaried personnel and 1,361 are hourly personnel. A collective bargaining agreement relating to two branch locations covers approximately 63 of our employees. We believe our relations with our employees are favorable and we have never experienced a work stoppage. Generally, the total number of employees does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year. However, acquisition activity or the opening of new branches may increase the number of our employees or fluctuations in the level of our business activity could require some staffing level adjustments in response to actual or anticipated customer demand.
 Health and Safety. The Health and Safety of our employees is an unwavering core value and is prioritized through our LIVESAFE program, which focuses on employee safety at Work, Home, and at Play. Senior operational leaders play a vital role in the communication, implementation, and follow-through of our safety program and we require accountability, commitment and compliance from all employees. Behavioral safety is the foundation of our safety culture which incorporates elements such as job safety observations, near miss reporting, safety meetings and ride-along programs, among others. These proactive measures in conjunction with the full implementation of stop-work authority at all levels leads to a record of safety at our branch locations. Assessments and metric reporting provide for transparency and accountability at all levels of our organization while incentive programs focused on accident prevention and behavior safety improvements reward the outstanding safety behavior of our employees.
Employee Wellness and Benefits. The health and wellness of our employees and their families is a top priority for us. We equip our employees with the benefits and tools they need to lead healthy, secure and balanced lives. We offer an array of comprehensive benefit options including retirement savings plans, medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, flexible medical spending accounts, life and disability insurance, accident and critical illness insurance and dependent care programs. We additionally provide paid time off, bereavement leave, wellness credits and employee assistance programs.
Inclusion and Diversity. We strive to build an inclusive and diverse team that reflects the variety of people, cultures and communities we interact with to create an inclusive, productive and diverse environment. We believe that varied perspectives best leverage employee talents, leading to creative thinking, open communication and greater engagement. The Company is committed to a full-spectrum of diversity inclusive of gender, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status, religion, culture, background, and experiences. Our efforts will continue to focus on hiring and supporting historically underrepresented groups and on building a more inclusive, diverse and empowered culture at the Company.
 Training and Development. We are committed to the continued development of our employees. We provide employees meaningful career and skill development opportunities to enhance their skills and level of service. We offer training in an array of categories such as management and leadership, rentals, sales, parts and service, safety, technology and vehicle operations. We require compliance with annual trainings covering work-place safety and technology security to safeguard our assets and our people. We believe these training opportunities support improved performance and effectiveness as well as personal and professional growth.
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability. We recognize the importance of environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices. We are committed to integrating, expanding and maintaining sustainable operations to support the long-term success of our business, shareholders, employees and customers. We continue to monitor the expansion of policies in this area and have established an internal ESG task force to embed ESG principles into our key business processes, as well as ensure compliance with future regulations. Recognizing the fundamental importance of ESG matters, our Board of Directors established an ESG Committee to provide governance, guidance and oversight over our ESG strategy and practices. While the ESG Committee holds primary responsibility for ESG oversight, our entire Board of Directors is fully engaged in these efforts.
