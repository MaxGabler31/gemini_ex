ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Signet Jewelers Limited (“Signet” or the “Company”) is the world’s largest retailer of diamond jewelry. Signet is incorporated in Bermuda and its address and telephone number are shown on the cover of this document. The Company, with 3,556 stores and kiosks at February 3, 2018, manages its business by store brand grouping, a description of which follows:

• | The Sterling Jewelers division is one reportable segment with 1,586 stores located in all 50 US states at February 3, 2018. Its stores operate nationally in malls and off-mall locations principally as Kay (Kay Jewelers and Kay Jewelers Outlet) and Jared (Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry and Jared Vault). The division also operates a variety of mall-based regional brands and the JamesAllen.com website, which was acquired in the September 2017 acquisition of R2Net. See Note 4 of Item 8 for additional information regarding the acquisition.


• | The Zale division consists of two reportable segments:


◦ | Zale Jewelry, which operated 868 jewelry stores at February 3, 2018, is located primarily in shopping malls in North America. Zale Jewelry includes the US store brand Zales (Zales Jewelers and Zales Outlet), which operates in all 50 US states, and the Canadian store brand Peoples Jewellers, which operates in nine provinces. Zale Jewelry also operates regional brands in both the US and Canada.


◦ | Piercing Pagoda, which operated 598 mall-based kiosks at February 3, 2018, is located in US shopping malls.


• | The UK Jewelry division is one reportable segment with 504 stores located in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and Channel Islands at February 3, 2018. Its stores operate in shopping malls and off-mall locations (i.e. high street) principally as H.Samuel and Ernest Jones.

Certain company activities (e.g. diamond sourcing) are managed as a separate operating segment and are aggregated with unallocated corporate administrative functions in the segment “Other” for financial reporting purposes. Signet’s diamond sourcing function includes our diamond polishing factory in Botswana. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company realigned its organizational structure. The new structure will allow for further integration of operational and product development processes and support growth strategies. In accordance with this organizational change, beginning with quarterly reporting for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2018, the Company will report three reportable segments as follows: North America, International, and Other. See Note 5 of Item 8 for additional information regarding the Company’s reportable segments. 
MISSION & STRATEGY
Signet’s mission is to help customers “Celebrate Life and Express Love.” Our vision and strategy is to take the lead and be the world’s premier jeweler by relentlessly connecting with customers, earning their trust with every interaction everywhere. Our five strategic pillars all center on a customer first omni-channel experience. These pillars included below define our key priorities and growth focus areas.

• | Grow jewelry market share


• | Best in bridal


• | Win in fashion and gifting


• | Digital first and data driven


• | People, purpose and passion

Signet continues to be the market share leader in North America in a large, growing and fragmented category, with the opportunity for additional share gains as we leverage our scale in innovation, marketing and procurement. However, before fully achieving this opportunity, Signet has recognized the need to transform its business to invest in growth initiatives while repositioning our real estate portfolio and lowering our cost structure. As a result, Signet is launching a three-year comprehensive transformation plan “Signet’s Path to Brilliance” to reposition the company to be a share gaining, omni-channel jewelry category leader. The three-year plan includes cost efficiencies, a portion of which will be reinvested in growth initiatives including e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities and product and store experience innovation. We believe this plan will enable the Company to deliver long-term sustainable, profitable sales growth and create value for shareholders.
Key components of the transformation plan include:

• | Optimizing real estate footprint. Following an evaluation of its real estate footprint, utilization, and cost structure, Signet intends to reposition its portfolio to drive greater store productivity. Efforts include development and implementation of innovative store concepts to improve the in-store shopping experience, execution of opportunistic store relocations and store closures aimed at reducing the Company’s mall-based exposure and exiting regional brands. Signet anticipates, pending the outcome of this evaluation, to close over 200 stores by the end of Fiscal 2019. As approximately three quarters of stores expected to close are within the same mall as another Signet banner, the company expects a certain amount of revenue from closed stores to transfer to remaining Signet stores.

• | Reducing non-customer facing costs. In line with Signet’s goal of creating a Culture of Agility and Efficiency, the Company is implementing initiatives across its operations, including strategic sourcing, distribution and warehousing, and corporate and support functions to drive cost savings and operational efficiencies. These include initiatives to reduce costs related to logistics, information technology, third party contracts and corporate expenses.


• | Enhancing Signet's e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities. Signet intends to invest in enhancing the customer experience across platforms and becoming the leading jewelry retailer across channels. New initiatives to drive increased digital traffic and improve conversion include using R2Net product image visualization across banners, greater personalization of content and product offering from enhanced behavioral data management, and enhancing digital marketing return on investment through greater visibility of customer's multi-touch journey. The company will also further expand and enhance omni-channel wish list, bridal configurator, online appointment booking and enabling ability to view local store inventory online. With these investments, Signet aims to grow digital sales as a percentage of total revenues to 15% in Fiscal 2021, compared to 8% in Fiscal 2018.


• | Leading innovation and customer value. Signet has launched an innovation engine whose goal is to develop new solutions to consumer jewelry needs and become the disruptor of innovation in our category. In addition, investments in data analytics and consumer insights including a system to track customer net promoter score should allow us to better service our customers. The Company is also addressing gaps in the customer value proposition. These investments are expected to result in improved product assortment and faster time to market as well as greater marketing and promotional effectiveness. We are in the process of completing our brand positioning work and will clearly differentiate our banners with Kay standing for celebrating the treasured relationship, Zales highly fashion oriented emphasizing style and self-expression and Jared celebrating one of a kind love and uniqueness. Clear differentiation of the banners enables more effective merchandising and marketing through segmentation of customers. 


• | Strengthening employee engagement and building capabilities. Our team and organization will be key to accomplishing the company's transformation goals. Signet has hired and promoted several executives to fill key leadership roles, is investing in building e-commerce, analytics and innovation resources and is focusing on reigniting employee engagement in our store operations and throughout the entire organization through cultural initiative training and development opportunities.

Competition and Signet Competitive Strengths
Jewelry retailing is highly fragmented and competitive. We compete against other specialty jewelers, as well as other retailers that sell jewelry, including department stores, mass merchandisers, discount stores, apparel and accessory fashion stores, brand retailers, online retail and auction sites, shopping clubs, home shopping television channels and direct home sellers. The jewelry category competes for customers’ share-of-wallet with other consumer sectors such as electronics, clothing and furniture, as well as travel and restaurants. This competition for consumers’ discretionary spending is particularly relevant to gift giving.
Signet’s competitive strengths include: strong store banner recognition, outstanding customer experience, branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise, sector-leading advertising, diversified real estate portfolio, supply chain leadership, full spectrum of financing and lease purchase options, and financial strength and flexibility. Signet increases the attraction of its store banners to customers through the use of branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise, while offering a compelling value proposition in more basic ranges. Signet accomplishes this by utilizing its supply chain and merchandising expertise, scale and balance sheet strength. The Company intends to further develop and refine its national television advertising, digital media and customer relationship marketing, which it believes are the most effective and cost efficient forms of marketing available to grow its market share. Management follows the operating principles of excellence in execution, testing before investing, continuous improvement and disciplined investment in all aspects of the business.
Capital Strategy
The Company expects to maintain a strong balance sheet that provides the flexibility to execute its strategic priorities, invest in its business, and then return excess cash to shareholders while ensuring adequate liquidity. Over time, Signet is committed to achieving an investment grade profile. Among the key tenets of Signet’s capital strategy are the following:

• | Maintain our expected long-term adjusted debt(1)/ adjusted EBITDAR(1) (“adjusted leverage ratio”) of 3.0x to 3.5x. To the extent results or other conditions result in a ratio higher than target, we will develop plans to return to less than 3.5x within a reasonable time-frame. For Fiscal 2019, the Company expects to exceed the high end of its target leverage range as it begins its transformation plan but expects to be back within the target by the end of the three-year transformation plan.


• | Distribute 70% of annual free cash flow(1) in the form of share repurchases and/or dividends assuming no other strategic uses of capital.


• | Consistently increase the dividend annually assuming no other strategic uses of capital.

The Company has a remaining share repurchase authorization as of the end of Fiscal 2018 of $650.6 million.

(1) | Adjusted debt, Adjusted EBITDAR, and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Signet believes they are useful measures to provide insight into how the Company intends to use capital. See Item 6 for reconciliation.

BACKGROUND
Operating segments
The business is currently managed as five reportable segments: the Sterling Jewelers division (61.1% of sales and 99.3% of operating income), the Zale division, which is comprised of the Zale Jewelry segment (24.2% of sales and 11.5% of operating income) and the Piercing Pagoda segment (4.5% of sales and 2.3% of operating income) and the UK Jewelry division (9.9% of sales and 5.7% of operating income). All divisions are managed by an executive committee, which is chaired by Signet’s Chief Executive Officer, who reports to the Board of Directors of Signet (the “Board”). The executive committee is responsible for operating decisions within parameters established by the Board. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of a diamond polishing factory in Gaborone, Botswana in Fiscal 2014, management established a separate reportable segment (“Other”). Other consists of all non-reportable segments, including subsidiaries involved in the purchasing and conversion of rough diamonds to polished stones and unallocated corporate administrative functions. See Note 5 of Item 8 for additional information regarding the Company’s segments as well as disclosure detailing and reconciling the components of operating income.
Trademarks and trade names 
Signet is not dependent on any material patents or licenses in any of its divisions. Signet has several well-established trademarks and trade names which are significant in maintaining its reputation and competitive position in the jewelry retailing industry. Some of these registered trademarks and trade names include the following:

• | Kay Jewelers®; Kay Jewelers Outlet®; Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry®; Jared Vault®; Jared Jewelry Boutique®; JB Robinson® Jewelers; Marks & Morgan Jewelers®; Every kiss begins with Kay®; He went to Jared®; Celebrate Life.

Store locations
Signet operates retail jewelry stores in a variety of real estate formats including mall-based, free-standing, strip center and outlet store locations. As of February 3, 2018, Signet operated 2,958 stores and 598 kiosks across 5.0 million square feet of retail space in the US, UK and Canada. This represented a decrease of 3.4% and a decrease of 1.7% in locations and retail space, respectively, from Fiscal 2017. Store locations by country and territory as of February 3, 2018 are disclosed in Item 2.
Customer experience
The customer experience is an essential element in the success of our business and Signet strives to continually improve the quality of the customer experience. Therefore the ability to recruit, develop and retain qualified jewelry consultants is an important element in enhancing customer satisfaction. We have comprehensive recruitment, training and incentive programs in place, including an annual flagship training conference in advance of the holiday season. 
Signet continues to invest in technology to enhance the customer experience, such as a clienteling system that we have initially implemented in our Sterling Jewelers division. This technology provides a single view of the customer with the capability to holistically capture customer information for the purpose of driving incremental sales to our customers. This allows jewelry consultants to improve and personalize their interactions with customers before, during and after store visits, to inform them of the latest merchandise offerings and fashion trends. Additionally, in Fiscal 2018, Signet completed the roll out of digital gemscopes to every store location in North America. These gemscopes leverage proprietary software to provide an enhanced digital view of gem stones and include the ability to email the image to the customer and the Jared Design & Service Center when sent for repair.
Omni-Channel capabilities are critical to achieving a seamless customer experience and are described further below.
We use employee and customer satisfaction metrics to monitor and improve performance. 
Omni-Channel 
As a specialty jeweler, Signet’s business differs from many other retailers such that a purchase of merchandise from any of Signet’s stores is personal, intimate and typically viewed as an important experience. Due to this dynamic, customers often invest time on Signet websites and social media to experience the merchandise assortments prior to visiting brick-and-mortar stores to execute a purchase transaction. Particularly related to high value transactions, customers will supplement their online experience with an in-store visit prior to finalizing a purchase.

Through Signet’s websites, we educate customers and provide them with a source of information on products and brands, available merchandise, as well as the ability to buy online. Our websites are integrated with each division’s stores, so that merchandise ordered online may be picked up at a store or delivered to the customer. Banner websites continue to make an important and growing contribution to the customer experience, as well as to each division’s marketing programs. For Fiscal 2019, the Company is focused on:

• | Investments in technology, including e-commerce platforms, focused on improving the online journey. Customer journey enhancements include user generated content, enhanced personalization / behavioral targeting, creative execution and brand differentiation. In addition, we are focused on omni-channel wishlist, online merchandising, in-store appointment booking, bridal configuration and much more.


• | Optimization of marketing through prioritizing dollars to digital spend and targeted marketing through traditional media.


• | Increased use of data analytics, clienteling and other key touch points to achieve a more comprehensive view of the customer and allow us to anticipate their needs.

Signet’s supplier relationships allow it to display suppliers’ inventories on the banner websites for sale to customers without holding the items in its inventory until the products are ordered by customers, which are referred to as “virtual inventory.” Virtual inventory expands the choice of merchandise available to customers both online and in-store.
During Fiscal 2018, we completed the strategic acquisition of R2Net. The transaction enables rapid enhancement to our digital technology capabilities. Capabilities deployed, or yet to be deployed, include high-quality diamond imagery and content technology, roll-out retina display screens in select Jared stores, diamond consult technology on our Jared Design-a-Ring platform available online 24 hours/7-days-a-week to offer real-time diamond consultation to customers, which gives us the ability to provide expert guidance on a range of topics from product specifications to grading certifications. R2Net's Ring Try-on App is being implemented within our Kay customer experience, giving the ability to virtually try on and experience the rings on mobile devices.
Raw materials 
The jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds, gold and, to a much lesser extent, other precious and semi-precious metals and stones. Diamonds account for about 45%, and gold about 14%, of Signet’s cost of merchandise sold, respectively.
Signet undertakes hedging for a portion of its requirement for gold through the use of net zero-cost collar arrangements, forward contracts and commodity purchasing. It is not possible to hedge against fluctuations in the cost of diamonds. The cost of raw materials is only part of the costs involved in determining the retail selling price of jewelry, with labor costs also being a significant factor. 
Diamond sourcing
Signet procures its diamonds mostly as finished jewelry and, to a smaller extent, as loose polished diamonds and rough diamonds which are in turn polished in Signet’s Botswana factory.
Finished jewelry
Signet purchases finished product where management has identified compelling value based on product design, cost and availability, among other factors. Under certain types of arrangements, this method of purchasing also provides the Company with the opportunity to reserve inventory held by vendors and to make returns or exchanges with suppliers, which reduces the risk of over- or under-purchasing. Signet’s scale, strong balance sheet and robust procurement systems enable it to purchase merchandise at advantageous prices and on favorable terms.
Loose diamonds
Signet purchases loose polished diamonds in global markets (e.g. India, Israel) from a variety of sources (e.g. polishers, traders). Signet mounts stones in settings purchased from manufacturers using third parties and in-house resources. By using these approaches, the cost of merchandise is reduced and the consistency of quality is maintained enabling Signet to provide better value to customers. Buying loose diamonds helps allow Signet’s buyers to gain a detailed understanding of the manufacturing cost structures and, in turn, leverage that knowledge with regard to negotiating better prices for the supply of finished products. 
Rough diamonds
Signet continues to take steps to advance its vertical integration, which includes rough diamond sourcing and processing. Signet’s objective with this initiative is to secure additional, reliable and consistent supplies of diamonds for customers worldwide while achieving further efficiencies in the supply chain. In Fiscal 2014, Signet acquired a diamond polishing factory in Gaborone, Botswana. The Company is a DeBeers sightholder, and receives contracted allocations of rough diamonds from Rio Tinto, DeBeers and Alrosa. Signet has also established a diamond liaison office in India and a diamond trading office in New York to further support its sourcing initiative. 
Rough diamonds are purchased directly from the miners and then have the stones marked, cut and polished in Signet’s own polishing facility. Any stones deemed unsuitable for Signet’s needs are sold to third parties with the objective of recovering the original cost of the stones.

Merchandising and purchasing
Management believes that a competitive strength is our industry-leading merchandising. Merchandise selection, innovation, availability and value are all critical success factors. The range of merchandise offered and the high level of inventory availability are supported centrally by extensive and continuous research and testing. Signet’s jewelry design center in New York evaluates global design trends, innovates, and helps our merchant teams develop new jewelry collections that resonate with customers.
Best-selling products are identified and replenished rapidly through analysis of sales by stock keeping unit. This approach enables Signet to deliver a focused assortment of merchandise to maximize sales and inventory turn, and minimize the need for discounting. Signet believes it is able to offer greater value and consistency of merchandise than its competitors due to its supply chain strengths. The scale and information systems available to us and the evolution of jewelry fashion trends allow for the careful testing of new merchandise in a range of representative stores. This enables us to make informed decisions about which merchandise to select, thereby increasing our ability to satisfy customers’ requirements while reducing the likelihood of having to discount merchandise.
Merchandise mix
Details of merchandise mix (excluding repairs, warranty and other miscellaneous sales) are shown below:

 | Sterling Jewelers division | | Zale division | | UK Jewelry division | TotalSignet
Fiscal 2018 | | | | | | 
Bridal | 50 | % | | 44 | % | 36 | % | 46 | %
Fashion | 40 | % | | 52 | % | 28 | % | 43 | %
Watches | 6 | % | | 3 | % | 34 | % | 8 | %
Other | 4 | % | | 1 | % | 2 | % | 3 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %
Fiscal 2017 | | | | | | 
Bridal | 50 | % | | 45 | % | 38 | % | 47 | %
Fashion | 39 | % | | 51 | % | 27 | % | 41 | %
Watches | 6 | % | | 3 | % | 32 | % | 8 | %
Other | 5 | % | | 1 | % | 3 | % | 4 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

The bridal category, which includes engagement, wedding and anniversary purchases, is predominantly diamond jewelry. Like fashion jewelry and watches, bridal is to an extent dependent on the economic environment as customers can trade up or down price points depending on their available budget. Bridal represented approximately 50% of Signet’s total merchandise sales.
Gift giving is particularly important during the Holiday Season, Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day. In Fiscal 2018, Signet had several successful fashion jewelry collections including Disney Enchanted and Vera Wang Love® (not all collections are sold in every store banner).
Merchandise is categorized as non-branded, third party branded, and branded differentiated and exclusive. Non-branded merchandise includes items and styles such as bracelets, gold necklaces, solitaire diamond rings, and diamond stud earrings. Third party branded merchandise includes mostly watches, but also includes ranges of charm bracelets. Branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise are items that are branded and exclusive to Signet within its marketplaces, or that are not widely available in other jewelry retailers (e.g Ever Us, Vera Wang Love, Neil Lane).
Branded differentiated and exclusive ranges 
Management believes that the development of branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise raises the profile of Signet’s banners, helps to drive sales and provides its well-trained sales associates with a powerful selling proposition. National television advertisements include elements that drive brand awareness and purchase intent of these ranges. Signet’s scale and proven record of success in developing branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise attracts offers of such programs from jewelry manufacturers, designers and others ahead of competing retailers, and enables it to leverage its supply chain strengths. 
Merchandise held on consignment
Merchandise held on consignment is used to enhance product selection and test new designs. This minimizes exposure to changes in fashion trends and obsolescence, and provides the flexibility to return non-performing merchandise. Virtually all of Signet’s consignment inventory is held in the US. 
8

Suppliers
In Fiscal 2018, the five largest suppliers collectively accounted for 20.3% of total purchases, with the largest supplier comprising 5.6%. Signet transacts business with suppliers on a worldwide basis at various stages of the supply chain with third party diamond cutting and jewelry manufacturing being predominantly carried out in Asia.
Marketing and advertising
Customers’ confidence in our retail brands, store banner name recognition and advertising of branded differentiated and exclusive ranges are important factors in determining buying decisions in the jewelry industry where the majority of merchandise is unbranded. Therefore, Signet continues to strengthen and promote its store banners and merchandise brands by focusing on delivering superior customer service and building brand name recognition. The Company’s omni-channel approach leverages marketing investments in television, digital media (desktop, mobile and social), radio, print, catalog, direct mail, point of sale signage and in-store displays.
While marketing activities are undertaken throughout the year, the level of activity is concentrated at periods when customers are expected to be most receptive to marketing messages, which is ahead of Christmas Day, Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day. A significant amount of the advertising expenditure is spent on national television advertising, which is used to promote the store banners. Within such advertisements, Signet also promotes certain merchandise ranges, in particular its branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise and other branded products. Statistical and technology-based systems are employed to support customer relationship marketing programs that use a proprietary database to build customer loyalty and strengthen the relationship with customers through mail, email, social media and telephone communications. The programs target current customers with special savings and merchandise offers during key sales periods. Our targeted marketing efforts are aligned with our customer segmentation approach which, as discussed previously, differentiates our banners by focusing on customer attitudes and behaviors, rather than demographic information. In addition, invitations to special in-store promotional events are extended throughout the year.
Details of gross advertising, advertising before vendor contributions, by division is shown below:

 | Fiscal 2018 | | Fiscal 2017 | | Fiscal 2016 
 | Gross advertising spending | as a % of divisional sales | | Gross advertising spending | as a % of divisional sales | | Gross advertising spending | as a % of divisional sales

Sterling Jewelers division | $ | 251.4 | | 6.6 | % | | $ | 258.6 | | 6.6 | % | $ | 261.2 | 6.5 | %
Zale division | 89.0 | | 5.0 | % | | 100.2 | | 5.5 | % | | 98.7 | 5.4 | % 
UK Jewelry division | 20.1 | | 3.3 | % | | 21.8 | | 3.4 | % | | 24.3 | 3.3 | % 
Signet | $ | 360.5 | | 5.8 | % | | $ | 380.6 | | 5.9 | % | $ | 384.2 | 5.9 | %

Customer finance
In our North American markets, Signet sells products for cash and for payment through major credit cards, online payment systems and lease purchase options. In addition, the Company has partnerships with third-party providers who directly extend credit to its customers, and who manage the Company’s in-house private label credit card program for owned receivables. 
Signet, through its subsidiary Sterling Jewelers Inc., completed the sale of the prime-only credit quality portion of Sterling’s in-house finance receivable portfolio to Alliance Data Systems Corporation (“Alliance data”) in October 2017. Under the Program Agreement, Comenity Bank provides credit and services to prime-only credit quality customers. Additionally, Signet and Genesis Financial Solutions (“Genesis”) entered into a servicing agreement in October 2017, under which Genesis provides credit servicing functions for Signet’s non-prime accounts receivable. 
During March 2018, Signet announced an agreement to sell its non-prime in-house credit card receivables primarily related to the Company’s Kay, Jared and Sterling regional brands’ customers. This agreement, in conjunction with the previously executed prime credit transaction and the outsourcing of the servicing of the non-prime credit program to Genesis will complete Signet’s transition to an outsourced credit structure. Under the agreement with CarVal Investors, Signet will sell its non-prime receivables originated by Signet to investment funds managed by CarVal Investors, which will allow Signet to divest itself of the credit risk relating to those receivables within two business days following origination, while maintaining a full spectrum of financing and leasing options for customers. The completion of the second phase of outsourcing of Signet’s credit portfolio is expected to significantly reduce consumer credit risk from the balance sheet, reduce working capital needs and allow the Company to continue to return significant capital to shareholders. Signet intends to use the proceeds from the sale of its non-prime receivables to repurchase shares in Fiscal 2019, subject to market conditions. In addition, for a five-year term, Signet will remain the issuer of non-prime credit with investment funds managed by CarVal Investors purchasing forward receivables at a discount rate determined in accordance with the agreement. Servicing of the non-prime receivables, including operational interfaces and customer servicing, will continue to be provided by Genesis.
For a period of time following the signing of this agreement and prior to the expected initial closing date on June 29, 2018, Signet has an option to appoint a minority party to purchase up to 30% of the non-prime receivables to be sold to CarVal Investors. Any agreement with the minority party would be on substantially the same terms.
9

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of Signet's Fiscal 2019 subject to certain closing conditions. Signet expects to reclassify the non-prime receivables to assets held for sale in the second month of the first quarter of Fiscal 2019. Subsequent to this classification, Signet will no longer recognize bad debt expense, late charge income or interest income from the non-prime receivables. There are no customer or store facing systems integration activities required of Signet to close the transaction and the Company does not expect any changes to the current credit application process.
Real estate
Management has specific operating and financial criteria that have to be satisfied before investing in new stores or renewing leases on existing stores. Substantially all the stores operated by Signet are leased. Signet intends to reposition its portfolio to drive greater store productivity. Efforts include development and implementation of innovative store concepts to improve the in-store shopping experience, execution of opportunistic store relocations and store closures aimed at reducing the Company’s mall-based exposure and exiting regional brands. Signet anticipates, pending the outcome of this evaluation, to close over 200 stores by the end of Fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 closures, net of new store openings, are expected to reduce gross selling square footage by approximately 4% to 5% versus year end Fiscal 2018.
Recent investment in the store portfolio is set out below:

Total store capital investment | $ | 98.9 | | | $ | 37.1 | | $ | 19.6 | | $ | 155.6

Seasonality
Signet’s sales are seasonal, with the first quarter slightly exceeding 20% of annual sales, the second and third quarters each approximating 20% and the fourth quarter accounting for almost 40% of annual sales, with December being by far the most important month of the year. The “Holiday Season” consists of results for the months of November and December. As a result, approximately 45% to 55% of Signet’s annual operating income normally occurs in the fourth quarter, comprised of nearly all of the UK Jewelry and Zale divisions’ annual operating income and about 40% to 45% of the Sterling Jewelers division’s annual operating income. However, due to the impacts of our strategic credit outsourcing and transformation initiatives in Fiscal 2019, we anticipate our operating profit will be generated entirely in the fourth quarter.

Employees 
In Fiscal 2018, the average number of full-time equivalent persons employed was 24,888. In addition, Signet usually employs a limited number of temporary employees during its fourth quarter. None of Signet’s employees in the UK and less than 1% of Signet’s employees in the US and Canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Regulation
Signet is required to comply with numerous laws and regulations covering areas such as consumer protection, consumer privacy, data protection, consumer credit, consumer credit insurance, health and safety, waste disposal, supply chain integrity, truth in advertising and employment. Management monitors changes in these laws to endeavor to comply with applicable requirements.
Markets
Signet operates in the US, Canada and UK markets.
US
According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, the total jewelry and watch market was approximately $91 billion at the end of 2017, up nearly 7% from the prior year. This implies a Signet jewelry market share of approximately 7%. Since 2000, the industry average annual growth rate is 3.7%. Nearly 90% of the market is represented by jewelry, with the balance being attributable to watches. According to the latest data from the US Labor Department, there were close to 20,600 jewelry stores in the country, down approximately 0.5% from the prior year.
Canada
The jewelry market in Canada, according to Euromonitor, has grown steadily over the past five years, rising to an estimated C$8.0 billion in 2016, the latest data available to Signet. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 4.3%. Euromonitor estimates that 2016 was up 5% in dollars and approximately 3% in units.
UK
In the UK, the jewelry and watch market stands at about £4.1 billion, according to Mintel. That market saw a recovery in 2015 with growth of 1.2%. Self-purchasing among young women and gifting among men represent the largest parts of the precious jewelry market. The growth represents a slight slowdown from that achieved in 2014 due to a shift towards lighter-weight pieces and a decrease in average selling prices.
STERLING JEWELERS DIVISION

Kay Jewelers (“Kay”)
Kay accounted for 39% of Signet’s sales in Fiscal 2018 (Fiscal 2017: 40%) and operated 1,247 stores in 50 states as of February 3, 2018 (January 28, 2017: 1,192 stores). Kay is the largest specialty retail jewelry store brand in the US based on sales. Kay mall stores typically occupy about 1,600 square feet and have approximately 1,300 square feet of selling space, whereas Kay off-mall stores typically occupy about 2,200 square feet and have approximately 1,800 square feet of selling space. Kay operates in malls and off-mall stores. Off-mall stores primarily are located in outlet malls and power centers. The Sterling Jewelers store footprint will continue to diversify in Fiscal 2019 as new stores will be principally Kay stores in off-mall locations.

Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry (“Jared”)
With 274 stores in 41 states as of February 3, 2018 (January 28, 2017: 275 stores), Jared is a leading off-mall destination specialty retail jewelry store chain, based on sales. Jared accounted for 19% of Signet’s sales in Fiscal 2018 (Fiscal 2017: 19%). Jared is the fourth largest US specialty retail jewelry brand by sales and offers enhanced selection of merchandise. Every Jared store has an on-site design and service center where most repairs are completed within the same day. Each store also has at least one diamond salon, a children’s play area, and complimentary refreshments.
The typical Jared store has about 4,800 square feet of selling space and approximately 6,000 square feet of total space. Jared locations are normally free-standing sites with high visibility and traffic flow, positioned close to major roads within shopping developments. Jared stores usually operate in retail centers that contain strong retail co-tenants, including big box, destination stores and some smaller specialty units.
Jared also operates Jared Jewelry Boutiques within malls. These mall stores have a smaller footprint than standard Jared locations and generally less than 2,000 square feet of selling space. A similar off-mall concept known as Jared 4.0, which utilizes approximately 3,600 square feet of selling space, allows for store openings in smaller markets, expands the Jared brand and increases the return on Jared advertising investment. Finally, Jared operates an outlet-mall concept known as Jared Vault which utilizes approximately 1,600 square feet of selling space. These stores are smaller than off-mall Jareds and offer a mix of identical products as Jared, as well as different, outlet-specific products at lower prices.
Details of Jared’s performance over the last three years is shown below: 

 | Fiscal 2018 | | Fiscal 2017 | | Fiscal 2016

JamesAllen.com
JamesAllen.com (“James Allen”) is a fast-growing millennial online retailer that was acquired by the Company during Fiscal 2018 as part of the R2Net acquisition. Unlike the rest of our store banners, James Allen does not operate or maintain physical retail stores. James Allen accounted for 1% of Signet’s sales in Fiscal 2018.
Sterling Jewelers regional brands
The Sterling Jewelers division also operates mall stores under a variety of established regional nameplates. Regional brands in the Sterling Jewelers division accounted for 2% of Signet’s sales in Fiscal 2018 (Fiscal 2017: 3%) and as of February 3, 2018, include 65 regional brand stores in 23 states (January 28, 2017: 121 stores in 29 states). The leading brands include JB Robinson Jewelers, Marks & Morgan Jewelers and Belden Jewelers. Also included in the regional nameplates are Goodman Jewelers, LeRoy’s Jewelers, Osterman Jewelers, Rogers Jewelers, Shaw’s Jewelers and Weisfield Jewelers. The Company’s strategy is to reduce regional brand locations through conversion to national store brands or through closure upon lease expiration.
Details of the regional brands’ performance over the last three years is shown below:

 | Fiscal 2018 | | Fiscal 2017 | | Fiscal 2016
Sales (millions) | $ | 112.2 | | | $ | 163.2 | | $ | 205.5

Sterling Jewelers operating review
Other sales
Custom design services represent less than 5% of sales but provide higher than average profitability. Our custom jewelry initiative has a proprietary computer selling system and in-store design capabilities. Design & Service Centers, located in Jared stores, are staffed with skilled artisans who support the custom business generated by other Sterling Jewelers division stores, as well as the Jared stores in which they are located. The custom design and repair function has its own field management and training structure.
Repair services represent less than 5% of sales, approximately 30% of transactions and are an important opportunity to build customer loyalty. The Jared Design & Service Centers, open the same hours as the store, also support other Sterling Jewelers and Zale division stores’ repair business.
The Sterling Jewelers division sells extended service plans covering lifetime repair service for jewelry and jewelry replacement plans. The lifetime repair service plans cover services such as ring sizing, refinishing and polishing, rhodium plating of white gold, earring repair, chain soldering and the resetting of diamonds and gemstones that arise due to the normal usage of the merchandise. Jewelry replacement plans require the issuance of new replacement merchandise if the original merchandise is determined to be defective or damaged within a defined period in accordance with the plan agreement. Any repair work is performed in-house.
Customer finance 
Several factors inherent in the US jewelry business support the circumstances through which Signet is uniquely positioned to generate profitable incremental business through its partner supported and on-balance sheet consumer payment programs. These factors include a high average transaction value and a significant population of customers seeking to finance merchandise, primarily in the bridal category. Prime credit offered by Alliance Data Systems, on-balance sheet lending for non-prime applicants serviced by Genesis Financial Solutions and a lease purchase option provided by Progressive Lease allow Signet to offer payment options that meet each customer’s individual needs.
As disclosed previously, Signet, through its subsidiary Sterling Jewelers Inc., completed the sale of the prime-only credit quality portion of Sterling’s in-house finance receivable portfolio to Alliance Data Systems in October 2017. During March 2018, Signet announced an agreement to sell its non-prime in-house credit card receivables primarily related to the Company’s Kay, Jared and Sterling regional banners’ customers. This agreement, in conjunction with the previously executed prime credit transaction and the outsourcing of the servicing of the non-prime credit program to Genesis will complete Signet’s transition to an outsourced credit structure.

(5)    The number of active accounts is based on credit cycle end date closest to the fiscal year end date.

(9) | During the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company completed the sale of a portion of the Sterling Jewelers customer in-house finance receivables. As a result, the Company’s receivable balance decreased significantly and thus restricts the usefulness of this metric for Fiscal 2018.

Other sales
Repair services represent approximately 2% of sales and 4% of transactions and are an important opportunity to build customer loyalty. During Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, Zale utilized the Jared Design & Service Centers to support its repair business for all US locations.
The Zale division sells extended service plans on certain products covering lifetime repair service and jewelry replacement. The lifetime extended service plans cover services such as ring sizing, refinishing and polishing, rhodium plating of white gold, earring repair, chain soldering and the resetting of diamonds and gemstones that arise due to the normal usage of the merchandise or a replacement option if the merchandise cannot be repaired. Zale Jewelry also offers customers a two year fine watch warranty. Additionally, Zale Jewelry and Piercing Pagoda offer a one year jewelry replacement program, which requires the issuance of new replacement merchandise if the original merchandise is determined to be defective or damaged in accordance with the plan agreement.

Customer finance
Our consumer credit program is an integral part of our business and is a major driver of customer loyalty. Customers are offered revolving and interest free credit plans under our private label credit card programs offered in conjunction with Comenity Bank and TD Bank Services in Canada, in conjunction with other alternative finance vehicles, including a second-look credit program offered by Genesis Financial Solutions implemented in September 2017, replacing the in-house program initiated in late Fiscal 2016. These provide customers of the Zale division with a wide variety of financing options. Participation of the Zale division in Signet’s in-house consumer credit program was immaterial in Fiscal 2018. Nearly 46% of Zale sales in the US were financed by private label customer credit in Fiscal 2018 (Fiscal 2017: 47%). Canadian private label credit card sales represented 27% of Canadian sales in Fiscal 2018 (Fiscal 2017: 32%).
UK JEWELRY DIVISION
The UK Jewelry division transacts mainly in British pounds, as sales and the majority of operating expenses are incurred in that currency and its results are then translated into US dollars for external reporting purposes. In Fiscal 2018, approximately 27% of goods purchased were made in US dollars (Fiscal 2017: 25%). The following information for the UK Jewelry division is given in British pounds as management believes that this presentation assists in understanding the performance of the UK Jewelry division. Movements in the US dollar to British pound exchange rate therefore may have an impact on the results of Signet, particularly in periods of exchange rate volatility.

UK Jewelry operating review
Customer finance
In Fiscal 2018, approximately 9% of the division’s sales were made through a customer finance program provided through a third party (Fiscal 2017: 8%). Signet does not provide this service itself in the UK due to low demand for customer finance.
OTHER
Other consists of all non-reportable operating segments, including activities related to the direct sourcing of rough diamonds, and is aggregated with unallocated corporate administrative functions. 
IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Signet recognizes that climate change is a major risk to society and therefore continues to take steps to reduce Signet’s climatic impact. Management believes that climate change has a limited influence on Signet’s performance and that it is of limited significance to the business.
