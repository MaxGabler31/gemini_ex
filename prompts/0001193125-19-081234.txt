ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

HopFed Bancorp, Inc. 
 HopFed Bancorp, Inc. (the Corporation) is a bank holding company incorporated in the state of Delaware and headquartered in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The Corporations principal business activities are conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Heritage Bank USA, Inc. (the Bank), a Kentucky state chartered commercial bank engaged in the business of accepting deposits and providing mortgage, consumer, construction and commercial loans to the general public through its retail banking offices. The Banks business activities are primarily limited to western Kentucky and middle and western Tennessee. The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions. Deposits at the Bank are insured up to the applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 
 The Bank is a Kentucky commercial chartered bank and is supervised by the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions (KDFI) and the FDIC. Supervision of the Corporation is conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis (FRB). 
 The Bank owns JBMM, LLC, a wholly owned limited liability company which owns and manages the Banks foreclosed assets. The Bank owns Heritage USA Title, LLC, which sells title insurance to the Banks real estate loan customers. The Bank owns Fort Webb LP, LLC, which owns a limited partnership interest in Fort Webb Elderly Housing LP, LLC, a low income senior citizen housing facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The facility offers apartments for rent for those senior citizens who qualify and is managed by the Bowling Green, Kentucky Housing Authority. 
 A substantial majority of the Banks loans are secured by real estate in the western Kentucky and middle and west Tennessee markets. In addition, all properties reported as foreclosed real estate, which the exception of a $37,000 single-family property that is located in Mississippi, are located in the Companys general market area. Accordingly, the ultimate ability to collect on a substantial portion of the Banks loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of foreclosed real estate is susceptible to changes in local market conditions.
