Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a leading commercial-stage ophthalmic medical technology company focused on treating corneal ectatic disorders and improving vision to reduce dependency on eyeglasses or contact lenses. Our proprietary Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform is designed to strengthen, stabilize and reshape the cornea utilizing corneal cross-linking in minimally invasive and non-invasive outpatient procedures to treat corneal ectatic disorders and correct refractive conditions, which are caused by changes in the shape of the eye that prevent light from focusing on the retina, causing blurred vision. Our proprietary Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform is comprised of our KXL and Mosaic systems, each of which delivers ultraviolet A, or UVA, light, and a suite of proprietary single-use riboflavin drug formulations, which, when applied together to the cornea, induce a biochemical reaction called corneal collagen cross-linking, or corneal cross-linking. Our KXL system in combination with our Photrexa drug formulations, which we launched in the United States in September 2016, is the first and only minimally invasive product offering approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, indicated for the treatment of progressive keratoconus and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. Additionally, the FDA granted us orphan drug designations and we have orphan drug exclusivity until 2023 that covers our Photrexa formulations used with our KXL system for our approved indications. We have obtained a Conformité Européene, or CE, mark for our Mosaic system, which allows it to be marketed throughout the European Union. The Mosaic System is capable of performing vision correction procedures and treating corneal ectatic disorders and we began a targeted international launch in late 2017. We plan to seek FDA approval for our Mosaic system and its associated drug formulations for the treatment of presbyopia as an initial targeted indication. We have invested significantly to establish the safety and broad clinical utility of our Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform and to drive its commercial adoption. We are the only company to have conducted randomized, sham-controlled clinical trials to receive marketing approval of a corneal cross-linking solution. We have conducted and supported more than 15 clinical trials and more than 130 peer-reviewed publications have been published, which provides support for what we believe to be the benefits of our Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform. To date, over 400,000 cross-linking procedures have been performed globally with our products, including more than 18,000 procedures performed in the United States alone. 
 Our Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform technology uses corneal cross-linking to strengthen the cornea and modify its shape, a process we refer to as corneal remodeling. Because the cornea functions as the eye’s outermost lens, responsible for 65% to 75% of the eye’s total focusing power, we believe corneal remodeling represents a powerful approach to treating corneal ectatic disorders and correcting vision. We believe corneal remodeling is a particularly effective treatment for progressive keratoconus, a disease in which the cornea progressively thins and weakens, as corneal remodeling strengthens and stabilizes the cornea to slow or arrest the progression of the disease. Corneal remodeling can also potentially be used to correct vision for otherwise healthy individuals by reshaping the cornea through a non-invasive procedure without the need for corneal surgical procedures. 
 The broad utility of our platform in treating corneal ectatic disorders and correcting vision has the potential to enable us to target a population that we estimate to be approximately 64 million people in the United States, which represents an estimated total addressable market opportunity of $26 billion. Our initial commercial focus within the United States is the keratoconus market, which, according to a recent Market Scope study from 2018, we believe represents a total addressable market of approximately 600,000 people and an opportunity of approximately $3 billion. Keratoconus typically manifests at an early age and is the leading cause of full thickness corneal transplants in the United States, a procedure that costs an average of $20,000 per transplant and may require one or more repeat procedures in the same eye later in life. Unlike corneal cross-linking, non-surgical solutions, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses, do not treat the underlying cause of keratoconus or slow disease progression, but temporarily attempt to address its symptoms, such as poor vision. 
 We estimate the vision correction market for our products in the United States to be approximately 63 million people, or an estimated total addressable market opportunity of $23 billion. Our initial clinical focus in vision correction is the treatment of patients with presbyopia, which we estimate affects more than 50 million people in the United States, representing an estimated total addressable market opportunity of approximately $15 billion. Vision correction procedures traditionally include refractive surgery or implants, the most common of which is laser in-situ keratomileusis, or LASIK. While LASIK is the most common vision correction procedure, we believe that it has not achieved greater market penetration due to patients’ fears of an ablative laser procedure and the associated side effects. Although we currently do not have any FDA-approved products to treat presbyopia, we believe that our Mosaic system, which is currently available in non-U.S. jurisdictions, addresses the critical challenges of currently available vision correction procedures, as corneal remodeling does not involve cutting or ablating the cornea. In addition to presbyopia, we are exploring the use of our Mosaic system as a treatment option for other large markets in the United States, including correcting refractive error for low myopia, which we estimate affects 13.5 million people, representing a total addressable market opportunity of approximately $8 billion, and post-cataract procedures, which we estimate affects 600,000 eyes annually, representing a total annual addressable market opportunity of approximately $180 million.

Our KXL system and its associated Photrexa formulations were approved by the FDA for the treatment of progressive keratoconus and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery on the basis of three pivotal randomized and sham-controlled Phase 3 U.S. clinical trials involving 205 patients with progressive keratoconus and 179 patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. The results showed a clinically significant difference in corneal steepening, which is a defining indicator of disease progression in keratoconic patients, in the treatment group in comparison to the control group. We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial pursuant to a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, for a new indication for our latest-generation KXL system, its associated investigational drug formulations and our Boost Goggles in a shorter and non-invasive procedure for the treatment of progressive keratoconus that leaves the corneal epithelium in place, which we refer to as Epi-On. If approved, we believe this combination will be the first corneal cross-linking product offering approved in the United States for an Epi-On procedure and may result in the grant of a three-year period of market exclusivity. Our CE mark for the KXL system, which we received in 2011, covers a broader indication and technical range of use than currently approved in the United States. For example, our KXL system can currently be used outside the United States to perform other corneal cross-linking procedures such as Lasik Xtra, a procedure performed in conjunction with refractive procedures such as LASIK to strengthen the cornea and stabilize procedure results. 
 Our Mosaic system, which we believe offers the world’s most advanced and versatile cross-linking technology, is available outside of the United States for performing vision correction procedures in addition to treating keratoconus. Unlike the KXL system, which delivers UVA light across a large portion of the cornea in a fixed pattern, our Mosaic system uses a digital UVA beam-forming technology in conjunction with real-time eye tracking to deliver metered UVA light to the cornea in a controllable pattern and to induce cross-linking in a targeted zone. This zonal corneal cross-linking induces a change in the shape of the cornea and enables refractive correction using a procedure we refer to as photorefractive intrastromal cross-linking, or PiXL. The Mosaic system and its associated drug formulations are currently being used in combination to treat and improve vision for keratoconic patients at a limited number of sites outside of the United States. We are generating additional clinical data to potentially expand applications of the Mosaic system and to increase physician and patient awareness and adoption. We plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in the first half of 2019 to evaluate the use of PiXL as a solution for vision improvement for patients with presbyopia. Contingent upon clinical development of corneal remodeling as a treatment for presbyopia, we also plan to leverage our platform to broaden our development programs into additional vision correction uses, such as the treatment of refractive error for low myopia and post-cataract procedures. 
 We sell our products primarily to ophthalmologists, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers, or ASCs. The physicians primarily involved in corneal cross-linking are ophthalmologists who are either corneal specialists or trained in refractive procedures. According to Market Scope estimates, there are approximately 1,100 corneal refractive centers in the United States. Of these centers, we estimate there are approximately 800 centers in which a majority of cataract and refractive surgeons, as well as corneal specialists who treat keratoconus, are located. As of December 31, 2018, our KXL systems are placed in 312 centers. In the United States, we sell our products through a direct sales team that, as of December 31, 2018, consisted of ten sales professionals. If we are able to obtain FDA approval for our Mosaic system and its associated drug formulations for the treatment of presbyopia, we expect to leverage our existing sales force to cross-sell our KXL and Mosaic systems and their respective drug formulations, as they share the same target customers. In addition to the approximately 800 centers we are targeting for keratoconus, we expect to sell the Mosaic system, if approved, to the remaining 300 corneal refractive centers that focus exclusively on refractive procedures. Outside the United States, we sell our products through a broad network of distribution partners located in markets where we see the greatest potential for corneal cross-linking procedures. 
 We have successfully established broad private payor coverage and are continuing to work on pursuing favorable payment policies for use of our KXL system to treat keratoconus, with 63 private payors covering a total of up to 170 million covered lives in the United States, which we estimate includes approximately 95% of our estimated total U.S. addressable market for keratoconus. Corneal cross-linking for the treatment of keratoconus was granted a Category III Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code, and in November 2018, we received a product-specific J code for our Photrexa formulations. The J code became effective on January 1, 2019. We expect these changes will help stabilize payment policies. Outside the United States, reimbursement practices for keratoconus therapies depend on where the patient lives, but generally, there is some form of reimbursement in place to cover the procedure. In contrast, vision correction procedures are generally not covered by insurance and are paid for out-of-pocket by the patient. If we receive FDA approval for the Mosaic system and its associated drug formulations to perform vision correction procedures for the treatment of presbyopia, we would expect providers to establish a price per procedure that is self-paid and competitive with current self-paid vision correction procedures, such as LASIK.

Since our U.S. commercial launch of the KXL system and its associated Photrexa formulations in September 2016, we have sold over 300 KXL systems in the United States, and since our KXL system was CE marked in 2011, we have sold over 700 KXL systems outside the United States. Since limited our launch outside the United States, we have sold 22 Mosaic systems outside of the United States. We generated revenue of $27.7 million, with a gross margin of 60.7% and a net loss of $25.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to revenue of $20.2 million, with a gross margin of 51.1% and a net loss of $21.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017.

 Overview of the Cornea 
 The cornea functions as the eye’s outermost layer. It is the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye and functions as a lens that converges and focuses the image into the eye. In fact, the cornea is responsible for 65% to 75% of the eye’s total focusing power. 
 

7

There are three main layers of the cornea important to cross-linking, including, from front to back, the epithelium, stroma and endothelium. The epithelium is the most superficial layer of the cornea and stops outside matter from entering the eye and absorbs oxygen and nutrients from tears. The stroma, which is the middle and thickest layer of the cornea, is primarily composed of water and collagen. The collagen proteins give the cornea its strength, elasticity and solid form. The endothelium, which is the thin, innermost layer of the cornea, plays a critical role in maintaining corneal hydration by pumping water out of the stroma, enabling transparency. As the cornea provides an important focusing mechanism for the eye, both shape and strength are essential to the cornea. 
 Our Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform 
 Our Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform is designed to strengthen, stabilize and reshape the cornea utilizing corneal cross-linking in minimally invasive and non-invasive outpatient procedures to treat corneal ectatic disorders, and in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, correct refractive conditions. Normal corneal stroma has collagen fibrils with bridges, or cross-links, present between them. Ectatic corneas have a distorted arrangement of these collagen fibrils with reduced thickness and strength, which results in vision impairment as the corneal loses structural shape and begins to bulge. Corneal cross-linking is a bioengineering technique that adds special bonds between the collagen fibers in the eye to increase the mechanical stability of the cornea. 
 The corneal cross-linking reaction typically requires three key components: (1) a biological form of riboflavin, a derivative of Vitamin B2, which is typically administered through eye drops and acts as a photosensitizer, (2) a UVA light source, which serves as a photoactivator and (3) oxygen, which is an essential component of cross-linking and is rapidly depleted upon UVA activation. When riboflavin is applied to the cornea and activated by UVA light, a biomechanical reaction produces reactive oxygen radicals that cause induction of collagen cross-links by forming new covalent bonds. This increases corneal rigidity and stiffens the anterior corneal stroma. As a result, cross-linking addresses the thinning and distortion of the cornea and the cornea is remodeled by becoming stronger. We developed our Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform to improve the corneal cross-linking procedure. The figure below illustrates the steps of our corneal cross-linking procedure. 
 General Steps to Our Corneal Cross-Linking Procedures 
 
The Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform currently consists of two separate devices and associated drug formulations. Our KXL system delivers UVA light across a large portion of the cornea, inducing corneal cross-linking in combination with our Photrexa formulations to stabilize the cornea and slow or stop progression of a disease. Our Mosaic system, which has not been approved in the United States, uses a digital UVA beam-forming technology in conjunction with real-time eye tracking to deliver metered UVA light to the cornea in a controllable pattern and to induce cross-linking in combination with its associated riboflavin formulations in a targeted zone to stabilize and reshape the cornea to improve vision. We also intend to enhance our Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform with the introduction of our Boost Goggles, an additional investigational device component designed to allow for supplemental oxygen delivery to enhance the cross-linking reaction. We believe this component is essential for enabling us to non-invasively treat corneal ectatic disorders and refractive conditions by leaving the epithelium intact.

Benefits of the Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform 
 We believe our industry-leading Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform has a number of highly attractive benefits: 
  
• | Corneal cross-linking using the KXL system and its associated Photrexa formulations offers safe, minimally invasive outpatient procedures, including the only FDA-approved alternative to surgical intervention for the treatment of keratoconus. The minimally invasive procedure indicated for use with our products is outpatient and has been well-tolerated for the treatment of progressive keratoconus. In addition, we are in the process of running a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for our Epi-On procedure using our latest generation KXL system, its associated drug formulations and our Boost Goggles, which, if approved by the FDA, will enable physicians to perform a shorter and non-invasive procedure for the treatment of progressive keratoconus that leaves the corneal epithelium in place. We believe this combination represents the latest-generation of our cross-linking procedure by further simplifying the procedure, improving patient comfort and leading to faster recovery times.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High corneal cross-linking procedure success rate with demonstrated long-lasting effects. Corneal cross-linking has been used for more than a decade outside of the United States to treat corneal ectatic disorders. An independent retrospective study published in 2015, which observed non-U.S. patients who had received treatment for keratoconus substantially similar to ours, showed a treatment success rate of over 90% with average follow-up of approximately 11 years. We believe this success rate has the potential to extend further and could extend to refractive conditions due to the same mechanism of action.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhances quality of vision. Corneal remodeling is not only designed to address the root causes of corneal ectatic disorders, but it can also reshape the cornea for purposes of increasing visual acuity. As part of our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of progressive keratoconus, we observed an improvement of more than one line of best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, one year after surgery. We plan to further investigate the impact of corneal cross-linking on visual acuity by performing clinical trials using our Mosaic system.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy-to-use with a minimal learning curve. Our KXL and Mosaic systems have easy-to-use interfaces that guide physicians through the treatment and have built-in self-calibration. Ophthalmologists are familiar with the techniques used in our corneal cross-linking procedure, such as epithelium removal, application of eye drops and the use of eye-tracking devices. Because of the minimal training time involved in learning how to perform our procedures on our KXL and Mosaic systems, we believe our devices are suitable for use by most ophthalmologists. Further, we believe this increases the appeal and utilization of our products as effective treatment options.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations supported by strong clinical data. We believe having an FDA-approved product helps to demonstrate the strength of our corneal cross-linking clinical data and is important for physicians in the United States and abroad due to the rigor of attaining approval. Furthermore, because the FDA regulates production of pharmaceuticals and medical devices requiring good manufacturing practices, physicians know there are tight quality controls around the production of our products. In the European Union, both our KXL and Mosaic systems are currently CE marked. We believe our commitment to securing regulatory approvals for our products for various cross-linking procedures will continue to be important to physicians as they assess options for treating patients with corneal ectatic disorders and vision correction.

Overview of Corneal Ectatic Disorders and Current Treatments 
 Corneal ectatic disorders are comprised of a class of diseases characterized by an ectatic, or a misshaped, cornea. Corneal ectasia is typically caused by a weakening of the cornea, which can be due to a number of factors, including genetic causes, adverse side effects from ophthalmic refractive procedures, such as LASIK, or excessive eye rubbing. We are currently targeting two primary corneal ectatic disorders with our corneal cross-linking technology: keratoconus and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. 
Keratoconus 
 Keratoconus is mostly a hereditary, degenerative ectatic disease in which the typically round, dome-shaped cornea progressively thins and weakens, causing a cone-like corneal bulge due to normal internal pressure of the eye. Patients with moderate keratoconus are often challenged by routine tasks such as driving, reading and recognizing faces from a distance, and the visual disturbances can be aggravated in bright conditions due to glare. In advanced stages of the disease, corneal scarring may cause incapacitating vision loss that can only be addressed by replacing the patient’s diseased cornea with a donor cornea through a surgical transplant procedure known as penetrating keratoplasty. Rubbing the eyes and certain geographical factors, such as air quality related to dust, sand and dirt, are also thought to be contributing factors to keratoconus. 
 Other than our KXL system and our associated Photrexa formulations, there are no non-surgical treatments or FDA-approved products that slow or arrest progression of corneal ectatic disorders, such as keratoconus. Instead, currently available options for disease management include eyeglasses, rigid contact lenses or surgically implanted intracorneal ring segments, or ICRS, which only address symptoms of the disease, such as vision loss. While these options may be effective at managing the immediate vision impairment associated with early-stage corneal ectatic disorders, they do not treat the disease or slow or arrest disease progression. Over time, the severity of keratoconus and resulting vision loss can often lead to the need for a corneal transplant to restore visual function. According to an article published in the Survey of Ophthalmology journal in 1998, as many as 20% of patients with progressive keratoconus will ultimately require a corneal transplant, though it is not possible to predict which patients will progress to needing a transplant. A corneal transplant in the United States can cost an average of $20,000 per transplant. The procedure requires a long recovery period and presents risks of graft failure due to infection or rejection of the donated tissue. Corneal transplant patients are often required to use steroids and other medications for an extended period to prevent graft failure. Furthermore, a 2009 publication in Ophthalmology, found that 72% of grafts fail within 20 years and 98% failed at 30 years. As a result, younger cornea transplant patients will likely require more than one procedure during their lifetime. This is particularly relevant for keratoconic patients, as they often experience onset of disease in their teenage years and will likely require more than one procedure during their lifetime. 
 Prior to the 1990s, physicians were limited in their ability to effectively diagnose patients with keratoconus, as they had to utilize subjective visual exams. The lack of adequate corneal imaging topography techniques, an imaging technology that is useful for mapping and examining characteristics of the cornea such as shape, curvature, power and thickness, resulted in an under-reporting of the disease. In an article published by the American Journal of Ophthalmology in 1986, prior to the introduction of corneal topography, the potential keratoconic eyes available to be treated in the United States were estimated at 176,000 patients, or one in 2,000 people. More recently, however, advancements in corneal topography have enabled physicians to diagnose corneal irregularities more accurately, more objectively and earlier in the disease’s progression. As a result, a recent nationwide registration study of keratoconus in the Netherlands published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology in 2017 estimated that the prevalence was significantly higher than previously thought, at approximately one in 375 people. According to a 2018 study by Market Scope, there are approximately 600,000 people with progressive keratoconus in the United States and 17,000 new cases annually. We believe this represents a total addressable market opportunity of $3 billion for our KXL system. 
 10

We believe the U.S. market for the treatment of keratoconus using corneal cross-linking is less than 5% penetrated, primarily because there had been no FDA-approved therapeutic alternative for treating the disease until the FDA approved our KXL system and its associated Photrexa formulations in April 2016. A significant opportunity exists to increase the number of procedures performed in the United States using our KXL system and Photrexa formulations. We believe this is possible due to our commercial experience outside the United States, where corneal cross-linking has been established as the standard of care for the treatment of keratoconus for well over a decade. 
 Corneal Ectasia Following Refractive Surgery and Lasik Xtra 
 Corneal ectasia following refractive surgery is a serious complication that involves the cornea becoming weakened following a refractive procedure, such as LASIK, with symptoms similar to naturally occurring keratoconus. According to a publication in the Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery in 2012, the structural integrity of the cornea can be weakened by up to 33% during LASIK, as a result of the creation of the LASIK flap and thinning of the cornea, which can lead to corneal ectasia. Our KXL system is marketed to treat corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. The incidence of corneal ectasia following refractive surgery in the United States is relatively low, as U.S. ophthalmologists generally do not treat high myopic patients with a refractive error of -7.0 diopter, a unit measure of the refractive power of a lens, or more. 
 Outside the United States, where ophthalmologists do treat high myopic patients, an increasing number of ophthalmologists proactively cross-link the cornea during refractive surgery as a way to stabilize the cornea and potentially avoid corneal ectasia. We refer to this procedure as Lasik Xtra. The largest market opportunity for the Lasik Xtra procedure performed with our KXL system is outside the United States, as more than 2.0 million LASIK procedures are performed annually outside the United States. Specifically, we believe the opportunity is greatest in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, where physicians utilize LASIK to treat high myopic patients. Since 2012, our devices have been used to perform over 140,000 Lasik Xtra treatments worldwide, with approximately 34,700 procedures performed in the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 Overview of Vision Correction and Current Treatments 
 We believe corneal cross-linking has the potential to be an effective means of reducing or eliminating eyeglasses or contact lens dependence in patients requiring lower-level refractive error correction, including for presbyopia, low myopia and post-cataract refractive error, in addition to several other applications. While most individuals with low refractive errors of less than -1.5 diopters would like to see their vision improved, we believe that the fear of surgery outweighs the benefits of vision improvement for such patients. As a result, we believe these patients, who represent a large and attractive market, require a non-invasive solution for vision improvement. For example, in the United States, the majority of individuals with myopia are low myopic patients in the range of -0.75 diopters to -1.25 diopters. Rather than achieving vision correction through surgical procedures, such as LASIK or implants, we believe corneal cross-linking can effectively improve vision by reshaping and strengthening the cornea. We estimate the vision correction market for our products in the United States to be approximately 63 million people, or an estimated total addressable market opportunity of $23 billion. 
Presbyopia 
 Presbyopia is a refractive disorder that is a natural part of aging and affects everyone after the age of about 40. Presbyopia is primarily due to the hardening of the eye’s crystalline lens over time, resulting in a loss of lens elasticity or the ability of the lens to change shape in order to focus incoming light on the retina. Elasticity is slowly lost as people age, resulting in a slow decrease in the ability of the eye to focus on close objects and can impact common tasks such as reading fine print. The disorder may go unnoticed for several years after its initial onset but will worsen with age. Many patients begin noticing the effects of presbyopia after age 40, but the changes to the shape of the crystalline lens start at a younger age. 
 According to a study published in Ophthalmology, presbyopia affected approximately 1.8 billion people worldwide in 2015, or approximately 25% of the global population. We estimate the worldwide presbyopic population is expected to be approximately 2.1 billion people by the end of 2020. The market opportunity for presbyopia is large and growing due to the aging of the global population. The median age of the global population is projected to increase from 29 years in 2011 to 38 years by 2050. We believe a non-invasive treatment for presbyopia will be an attractive alternative for patients and physicians. We plan to develop our products for a subset of individuals with presbyopia that need low refractive correction of approximately +1.0 diopter and –1.0 diopter. We estimate that there are more than 50 million people in the United States that may be potential candidates for corneal cross-linking for the treatment of presbyopia, representing a total addressable market opportunity of approximately $15 billion. 
 Low Myopia 
 11

Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a vision condition in which close objects are seen clearly, but objects farther away appear blurred, and is usually caused by an elongation of the eyeball or a cornea having too much curvature, causing the image to be focused in front of the retina rather than on the retina. Myopia first occurs in school-age children and typically progresses until about age 20. The American Optometric Association estimates that myopia affects nearly 30% of the U.S. population. Some geographies, including South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, China and Japan, have shown a higher prevalence of myopia, at upwards of 80% to 90%. 
 Patients with myopia of -1.5 diopters or less, which we refer to as low myopia, typically do not opt for LASIK surgery. These individuals more often wear eyeglasses or contact lenses to correct their refractive errors. We believe LASIK has struggled to achieve more meaningful adoption with low myopic patients due to fear of the invasive LASIK process and the potential for unintended side effects. These side effects may include temporary discomfort and vision disturbances, LASIK flap complications, dry eye, irregular astigmatism, epithelial ingrowth, significant under-correction, overcorrection or regression, corneal ectasia following refractive surgery and eye infection. In a 2014 report on refractive surgery, of the approximately 94 million people in the United States with low myopia, fewer than 0.4% chose to be treated with laser vision correction, or LVC. We believe there is a significant clinical unmet need for patients suffering from low myopia who are seeking an alternative to invasive surgical procedures and prefer not to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses. We are initially developing our products for patients with low myopia of under -1.5 diopters. We estimate that there are 13.5 million people in the United States with low myopia that may be potential candidates for corneal cross-linking, representing approximately an $8 billion market. 
 Post-IOL Cataract Patients with Refractive Errors 
 According to Market Scope, in 2014, 9,900 surgeons performed 4.1 million cataract surgeries in the United States. Studies report that as many as 45% of patients that have had cataract surgery have some form of refractive error following the procedure, making them potential candidates for corneal cross-linking treatment. A subset of patients chose to correct their refractive error and presbyopia at the same time as their cataract surgery by selecting premium intraocular lenses, or IOLs, or opting for a monovision route to be able to see both far and near. Accurate target refraction in these patients is critical since these patients pay additional fees to obtain this benefit. It is estimated that 15% of the cataract patients chose premium IOLs. 
 We believe that corneal cross-linking could represent a useful tool alongside the implantation of premium IOLs. Premium IOLs are intended to correct some form of refractive error and are typically not fully reimbursed by insurance companies, thereby requiring some form of out-of-pocket payment from the patient. This results in patients having higher expectations of visual outcomes post procedure. We believe a procedure that can refine the refractive correction following implantation of premium IOLs would represent an attractive option for patients and physicians. We estimate that there are 600,000 eyes annually in the United States that may be potential candidates for corneal cross-linking, representing an annual market of approximately $180 million. 
 Other Applications 
 We continue to explore additional opportunities where our Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform could provide benefit to other conditions, such as hyperopia or astigmatism. Outside the United States, some physicians already use our platform to treat these and other applications pursuant to existing CE marks. We believe these to be additional opportunities for our platform, which we may explore further in the future. 
 12

Overview of Our Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform 
 Conventional therapies do not slow or arrest the progression of corneal ectatic disorders, and the costs and risks associated with corneal transplant procedures represent a significant burden for patients, physicians and payors. We believe that there is a clear unmet medical need for our minimally invasive and non-invasive corneal cross-linking technology to enable cornea remodeling to slow or arrest progression of the disease. The Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform currently consists of two separate devices and associated drug formulations. Our KXL system delivers UVA light across a large portion of the cornea, inducing corneal cross-linking in combination with our Photrexa formulations to stabilize the cornea and slow or stop progression of a disease. Our Mosaic system uses a digital UVA beam-forming technology in conjunction with real-time eye tracking to deliver metered UVA light to the cornea in a controllable pattern and to induce cross-linking in combination with its associated riboflavin formulations in a targeted zone to stabilize and reshape the cornea to improve vision. 
 

13

The KXL System 
 The KXL system delivers UVA light in a circular pattern across a large portion of the cornea, following the application of its associated drug formulations. Key components of the KXL system include an optical head and touch panel display. 
 
The optical head of the KXL system houses the UVA irradiation mechanism. The LED emits UVA radiation and, depending on the indication and geography, can emit different intensities for different time durations. A fixed aperture mounted in the UVA irradiation beam path is used to produce a circular area of irradiation at the treatment plane. Alignment lasers are used to aid the user in focusing the beam on the patient’s cornea. Fine alignment of the UVA beam through observation of the alignment lasers is controlled by the user through a wireless remote. The KXL system is portable, with an articulating arm to allow movement of the system for alignment of the UVA beam to the patient’s cornea. 
 Outside the United States, we received an EC Certificate of Conformity from our notified body for the KXL system for corneal cross-linking in 2011. The CE mark affixed to the KXL system on the basis of this Certificate relates to corneal cross-linking procedures more generally, as compared to our FDA approvals, which relate to specific corneal conditions using regimented treatment protocols. Our CE mark for our KXL system covers a broader indication and technical range of use than currently granted in the United States and procedures for which we may plan to pursue FDA approval in the future. For example, our KXL system can currently be marketed and used outside the United States to perform other corneal cross-linking procedures such as Lasik Xtra, a procedure performed in conjunction with refractive procedures such as LASIK to strengthen the cornea and stabilize procedure results. 
 
Broad Treatment for Keratoconus

Note: The figures on the left and right represent the corneal and photo activation areas during the CuRV procedure. The eye’s normal intraocular pressure, combined with stiffening of selective cornea regions, results in a flattening of the cornea. 
 14

KXL Procedure (Epi-Off) 
 The KXL system in combination with our Photrexa formulations is FDA-approved for the treatment of progressive keratoconus and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery using corneal cross-linking following removal of the corneal epithelium, which we refer to as the Epi-Off procedure. Removal of the epithelium, a procedure familiar to ophthalmologists, prior to delivery of our Photrexa formulations facilitates absorption of the drug into the stroma and eliminates the diffusion barrier for ambient oxygen. The KXL system sold in the United States has fixed UVA delivery settings, which is delivered at a lower intensity and for a longer period of time than for our Epi-On procedure. The procedure can take approximately 60 to 90 minutes to perform the entire procedure, including removal of the epithelium, which typically takes less than five minutes, administration of the Photrexa Viscous eye drops for 30 minutes and then delivery of the UVA light for 30 minutes. In some patient cases where the cornea has not sufficiently thickened, Photrexa is also needed to additionally prep the cornea for the application of the UVA light. 
 KXL Procedure (Epi-On) 
 We believe our latest-generation KXL system, its associated drug formulations and Boost Goggles, if approved, will offer an effective treatment for patients with keratoconus using the Epi-On procedure, while potentially offering a shorter procedure with greater patient comfort, more rapid healing and fewer adverse events than the Epi-Off procedure. In the European Union, the KXL system is CE marked according to the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC and can be used in accordance with the CE-marked indication to perform corneal cross-linking without the removal of the epithelium. The Epi-On procedure is enabled by new technology designed to eliminate the need for removal of the epithelium and to reduce treatment duration. This technology includes new drug formulations designed for the Epi-On procedure, an enhanced KXL system that is designed to deliver pulsed UVA light at a significantly higher power than used for our Epi-Off procedure in the United States, and our Boost Goggles, which is a proprietary device designed to deliver a high concentration of oxygen to the stroma throughout the cross-linking procedure. The higher-powered UVA light delivery increases the rate of oxygen consumption during the cross-linking procedure, requiring the addition of supplemental oxygen through the Boost Goggles, which is designed to provide a larger concentration of available oxygen that is required for the increased rate of reaction. The procedure typically takes approximately 20 minutes, including application of the eye drops for ten minutes and delivery of the UVA light and supplemental oxygen for approximately ten minutes. 
 In June 2018, we announced that we had begun enrolling patients in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our latest-generation KXL system, its associated drug formulations and Boost Goggles for the treatment of keratoconus using our Epi-On procedure. We are conducting this trial under an SPA with the FDA, which means that the FDA has agreed that the design and size of the Phase 3 clinical trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness of the indication studied. If our clinical trial is successful and we obtain FDA approval, we believe this combination will be the first corneal cross-linking product offering approved in the United States for an Epi-On procedure and may result in the grant of a three-year period of market exclusivity. We expect enrollment in this trial to be complete by the second half of 2019 and for the complete data set to be available in the first half of 2021. 
 Lasik Xtra 
 
Outside the United States and most commonly in East Asia, physicians use our KXL system to perform Lasik Xtra, which is a procedure we developed to address corneal weakening caused by refractive surgery such as LASIK and mitigate the risks of corneal ectasia and stabilizes the refractive correction following refractive surgery. 
 15

Lasik Xtra can be performed intraoperatively during a LASIK procedure to restore the biomechanical strength of the cornea, and typically adds a total of approximately three minutes to the LASIK procedure. After completion of a LASIK procedure and before the LASIK flap is repositioned, an intrastromal drug formulation is applied directly to the stromal bed. A higher concentration formulation is used for direct application to the stromal bed, with application time reduced to approximately 90 seconds. The LASIK flap is then repositioned as usual, and high power UVA light is applied using continuous illumination for approximately 90 seconds. The reduced treatment duration is enabled by the availability of oxygen under the flap, the availability of the higher-power setting of the KXL system and the presence of the drug formulation only in the target tissue. International clinical trials conducted by third parties have demonstrated that the strengthening induced by Lasik Xtra reduces refractive regression following LASIK. Based on these data, we believe Lasik Xtra may prevent or substantially reduce corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. Lasik Xtra can also be used in conjunction with other refractive surgeries that have a similar weakening effect on the cornea, such as photorefractive keratectomy, or PK. 
 The Mosaic System 
 The Mosaic system, which we believe offers the world’s most advanced and versatile cross-linking technology, is available outside of the United States for performing vision correction procedures in addition to treating keratoconus. Unlike the KXL system, which delivers UVA light across a large portion of the cornea, our Mosaic system uses a digital UVA beam-forming technology in conjunction with real-time eye tracking to deliver metered UVA light to the cornea in a controllable pattern and to induce cross-linking in a targeted zone of the cornea. This zonal corneal cross-linking induces a change in the shape of the cornea and enables refractive correction using a procedure we refer to as PiXL. Key components of the Mosaic system include an optical head and touch panel display. 
 
Precise registration between the UVA treatment pattern and the patient’s eye is enabled by importing a detailed map of the corneal topography and iris pattern of a patient’s eye, which is created by a third party corneal topographer, into our Mosaic system. Our software then establishes a common point of reference between the UVA illumination pattern and the topography of the patient’s eye by using unique features in the iris pattern. A clinician can view the topography of a patient’s eye and program the UVA illumination pattern based on structurally abnormal areas of the patient’s eye and the appropriate treatment plan. The UVA light then illuminates a digital micro mirror device, or DMD, and the UVA light reflected from the DMD is projected onto the patient’s eye. The Mosaic system automatically controls the configuration of the DMD’s mirrors such that the UVA light pattern is modulated in real time. A real-time eye tracking system keeps the UVA light pattern located on the desired region of the cornea throughout the procedure. These unique characteristics of the Mosaic system allow us to address these vision correction applications. 
 16

In the European Union, the Mosaic system is CE marked in accordance with the requirements of the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC for corneal cross-linking and can be used by ophthalmologists for a broader range of procedures than can be performed using the KXL system in the United States, including correcting lower-level refractive errors at the same time as treating keratoconus and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. The Mosaic system is currently being used to treat and improve vision for keratoconic patients at a limited number of sites outside of the United States. We are generating additional clinical data to expand its application and drive commercial adoption. We completed a Phase 1 trial of our Mosaic system and its associated drug formulations in five patients with functionally blind eyes, evaluating the safety and tolerability of the PiXL procedure with supplemental oxygen at UVA light doses of 10 and 15 joules per cm2. In this trial, which followed the patients for up to three months post-treatment, the PiXL procedure was observed to be well-tolerated with no occurrence of any treatment- or dose-related toxicity or serious adverse events. Proof-of-concept and safety of the PiXL procedure has also been demonstrated through investigator-initiated clinical trials outside the United States, in which a total of more than 200 myopic and presbyopic eyes have been treated. We plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in the first half of 2019 to evaluate the use of PiXL as a solution for vision improvement for presbyopic patients and if the clinical trial is successful, we plan to pursue FDA approval of the Mosaic system and its associated drug formulations for this indication. We have sold 20 Mosaic systems in countries including the European Union, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. 
 Customized Remodeled Vision Procedure (CuRV) 
 Custom Treatment for Keratoconus

Note: The figures on the left and right represent the corneal and photo activation areas during the CuRV procedure. The eye’s normal intraocular pressure, combined with stiffening of selective cornea regions, results in a flattening of the cornea. 
 Outside the United States, we are in limited commercialization of our Mosaic system for a procedure we have developed for treating keratoconus and addressing refractive conditions in a single procedure called Customized Remodeled Vision, or CuRV, procedure. The CuRV procedure is covered by the EC Certificate of Conformity we obtained for our Mosaic system. CuRV uses our Mosaic system to direct desired amounts of light to specific regions of the cornea to slow or arrest progression of the disease and change the corneal shape to improve vision. CuRV provides physicians with the ability to customize corneal cross-linking for the specific patient, which we believe can result in higher satisfaction and better clinical outcomes. Clinical trials have demonstrated that CuRV can result in greater flattening of the curvature of the cornea, improved corneal shape and faster epithelial healing, as compared to standard cross-linking. While our FDA-approved KXL system used for the Epi-Off procedure applies a circular UVA beam to uniformly strengthen the cornea, the Mosaic system applying the CuRV procedure uses a zonal UVA pattern derived from the patient’s imported corneal topography as well as real-time eye tracking technology to target and strengthen the weakest parts of the cornea. This treatment may lead to improved visual function, in addition to stabilization against keratoconus progression. The current procedure typically takes less than 30 minutes. We believe CuRV could be even faster if used in conjunction with our Boost Goggles. 
 17

PiXL Procedure 
 Outside the United States, we are planning to conduct clinical trials of our Mosaic system for the PiXL procedure for corneal remodeling, which is covered by the EC Certificate of Conformity obtained for our Mosaic system. The PiXL procedure, which uses our Mosaic system together with our Epi-On drug formulations and Boost Goggles, is designed to correct refractive error by strengthening a selective zone of the cornea to induce desired changes in corneal curvature. The strengthened zone has greater resistance to strain from the outwardly directed forces of the intraocular pressure, or IOP, of the eye than the untreated zone. The untreated region bends outward in response to the IOP, resulting in a relative flattening or steepening of the central zone of the cornea. 
 Our PiXL procedure provides a non-invasive means of changing the corneal shape by selectively strengthening corneal tissue, rather than using conventional refractive surgical techniques or implants. We expect that all of our refractive procedures will be done without removal of the epithelium. The non-invasive nature of PiXL offers an alternative to conventional refractive surgery for patients that are not optimal candidates for LASIK or photorefractive keratectomy, or PRK, due to abnormalities in corneal shape, corneal weakness, thin corneas, other risk factors for surgical complications or a reluctance to undergo surgery. 
 The procedure typically takes less than 30 minutes and is intended to be conducted using our Boost Goggles. Following application of our investigational Epi-On drug formulation, our Mosaic system delivers a ring-like UVA pattern, which targets steepening of the untreated central cornea to improve near vision. Based on clinical results of the Mosaic system’s application of the PiXL procedure outside the United States, we believe the PiXL procedure can offer an effective means of reducing or eliminating eyeglasses or contact lens dependence in patients requiring lower-level refractive error correction, including for presbyopia, low myopia, post-cataract refractive error and potentially other conditions, such as hyperopia and astigmatism. 
 Presbyopia Application 
 Ring Treatment for Presbyopia

Note: The figures on the left and right represents the corneal and photo activation areas during the PiXL procedure. The stiffening of selective cornea regions allows for corneal remodeling as intraocular pressure is redistributed within the eye resulting in a steepening of the cornea. 
 We plan on conducting a Phase 2a clinical trial outside the United States to formally evaluate the safety and efficacy of the PiXL procedure using the Mosaic system and its associated drug formulations for the treatment of presbyopia and expect enrollment to begin in the first half of 2019. We expect interim data from the Phase 2a clinical trial to inform product or procedure modifications and further clinical development. We expect to begin a Phase 2b clinical trial utilizing our Mosaic system, Boost Goggles and a drug formulation in the United States in the first half of 2020. 
 18

Low Myopia Application 
 Central Treatment for Myopia

Note: The figures on the left and right represents the corneal and photo activation areas during the Mosaic procedures. The stiffening of selective cornea regions allows for corneal remodeling as intraocular pressure is redistributed within the eye resulting in a flattening of the cornea. 
 Similar to presbyopia, outside the United States, we believe the PiXL procedure may offer an effective means of improving distance vision in patients suffering from low myopia who do not opt for LASIK due to their mild condition or fear of surgery. Following application of the Epi-On drug formulation, our Mosaic system delivers a centrally limited UVA pattern, resulting in flattening of the treated central cornea and reduction of myopic refractive error. A total of more than 200 myopic eyes have been treated to date with the PiXL procedure in investigator-initiated clinical trials with the Mosaic system in Germany, France, Sweden and India, which has informed our development of refined PiXL treatment parameters. We believe the results from these investigator-initiated trials in myopia and our own future clinical trials in presbyopia will guide our decisions regarding a potential future regulatory approval pathway for the treatment of individuals with low myopia in the United States. 
 Post-Cataract Refractive Error Application 
 Outside the United States, our PiXL procedure also has the potential to offer non-invasive refractive correction for patients with residual refractive error following implantation of IOLs. We believe that this application of the PiXL procedure could improve outcomes following cataract procedures and would have utility following implantation of IOLs. We believe that patients and surgeons would welcome non-invasive options to correct residual post-operative refractive error after IOL implantation so that their patients can avoid other corrective measures. We believe our PiXL procedure is well positioned to fill this need for a non-invasive alternative to LVC for the cataract surgeon and patient. Outside the United States, we believe that the PiXL procedure will offer an effective means of reducing refractive errors in this patient population.
19

Riboflavin Drug Formulations 
 We have a broad suite of proprietary single-use riboflavin drug formulations, which we either own or have exclusively licensed and are intended for use either with our KXL or Mosaic systems, depending on the procedure and the patient geography. Our Photrexa family of drug formulations, which are used in combination with our KXL system in the United States, are manufactured at a good manufacturing practice, or GMP, certified facility; and are the only FDA-approved riboflavin ophthalmic formulations used with our KXL system to treat progressive keratoconus and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. Outside the United States, our family of drug formulations for use with our KXL and Mosaic systems consist of VibeX Xtra, VibeX Rapid, ParaCel Part 1 and ParaCel Part 2. 
RFID Treatment Cards 
 Our drug formulations are sold in packages containing procedure- and drug-specific RFID treatment cards that ensure the appropriate combination of drug formulation and device parameter to support patient safety, efficacy and durability. 
Boost Goggles 
 
20

Oxygen is an essential component of corneal cross-linking. Its availability is rapidly depleted upon UVA activation, especially in higher-powered corneal cross-linking procedures. Furthermore, in procedures where the epithelium remains in place, the epithelium may act as a barrier to oxygen diffusion. We have developed our proprietary, single-use Boost Goggles to supply and concentrate oxygen around the procedure site. The Boost Goggles are placed onto the patient’s face and intended to facilitate the delivery of supplemental oxygen while still allowing for the unobstructed delivery of UVA light to the cornea. Our Boost Goggles are currently being developed in conjunction with our Epi-On procedure and our vision correction applications. Both the Boost Goggles and the use of supplemental oxygen in corneal cross-linking procedures are patent-protected in the United States and are investigational. 
Clinical Results and Studies 
 We have invested significantly to establish the safety and broad clinical utility of our Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform and to drive its commercial adoption and are the only company to have completed randomized, sham-controlled clinical trials to receive marketing approval of a corneal cross-linking solution. A significant body of published clinical evidence, which includes more than 15 clinical trials and more than 130 peer-reviewed publications, provides support for what we believe to be the benefits, safety and effectiveness of our Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform. 
Completed Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trials to Support Approval of our KXL System 
 We completed three pivotal randomized and sham-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States that evaluated the safety and efficacy of our KXL system in combination with its associated Photrexa formulations in a total of 205 patients with progressive keratoconus and 179 patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. The results from these trials formed the basis of our NDA submission in 2013. The first Phase 3 clinical trial, which we refer to as the UVX-001 trial, was a single-center clinical trial that enrolled both patients with progressive keratoconus and patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. The other two Phase 3 clinical trials, which we refer to as the UVX-002 and UVX-003 trials, respectively, were multi-center clinical trials, one of which only enrolled patients with progressive keratoconus and the other only enrolled patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. In each trial, we designated one eye of each patient as the “trial eye.” Trial eyes were randomized to receive either corneal cross-linking or a sham treatment, and patients were followed for up to 12 months after treatment. Each treated eye received only a single course of corneal cross-linking treatment. Additionally, three months after the treatment of the trial eye, sham-treated trial eyes and non-trial eyes could receive corneal cross-linking at the physician’s and patient’s discretion. 
 In all three trials, the primary efficacy endpoint was a statistically significant differential of equal to or greater than 1.0 diopter in change in maximum corneal curvature from baseline between the treatment and sham groups, as measured by maximum keratometry, or Kmax. Kmax is an objective measurement of the steepest corneal curvature, where an increasing Kmax denotes disease progression. Since sham-treated trial eyes could receive corneal cross-linking treatment after month 3, we used last observation carried forward, or LOCF, methodology to impute missing data for the primary analysis of efficacy. 
 21

Efficacy Results 
 The single-center trial, UVX-001, enrolled 58 patients with progressive keratoconus and 49 patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. The UVX-002 trial enrolled 147 patients with progressive keratoconus and the UVX-003 trial enrolled 130 patients with corneal ectasia. In each trial, cross-linked eyes showed increasing improvement in Kmax from Month 3 through Month 12. Summaries of the Kmax change from baseline for each of the trials are presented below. 
Mean Change from Baseline Kmax 
 


22



For simplicity of presentation, the graph below depicts the primary efficacy endpoint data for all progressive keratoconic patients pooled across the UVX-001 and UVX-002 trials, where the data from the individual trials is provided in the first two graphs above. Although the pooled data was submitted to the FDA, the FDA did not include pooled data in the approved label for the KXL system and its associated Photrexa formulations. 
 23

These results showed a clinically significant impact of treatment on corneal steepening, which is a defining indicator of disease progression in keratoconic patients, versus control. 
 
Safety Results 
 We obtained safety data from 193 randomized treated trial eyes, 191 control eyes and 319 other placebo and non-trial eyes that received corneal cross-linking treatment with the KXL system. 
 In keratoconic patients, the most common ocular adverse events observed were corneal opacity, punctate keratitis points of localized inflammation of the superficial layer of the cornea, corneal striae, or wrinkles or folds in the cornea, corneal epithelium defect, eye pain, reduced visual acuity and blurred vision. In patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery, the most common ocular adverse events observed were corneal opacity, corneal epithelium defect, corneal striae, dry eye, eye pain, punctate keratitis, photophobia, reduced visual acuity and blurred vision. These events are commonly observed following removal of the corneal epithelium and in the treatment group of our trials, occurred at a higher incidence than observed in control patients. 
 The majority of adverse events reported were resolved during the first month, while events such as corneal epithelium defect, corneal striae, punctate keratitis, photophobia, dry eye, eye pain and decreased visual acuity took up to six months after treatment to resolve and corneal opacity took up to 12 months after treatment to resolve. In 1% to 2% of keratoconic patients, at least one event of corneal epithelium defect, corneal edema, corneal opacity and corneal scar was evident at 12 months. In 6% of patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery, corneal opacity was present at 12 months. 
 Ancillary Results - Visual Acuity 
 Visual acuity was measured using a standard vision test similar to the eye chart routinely used in a doctor’s office. The vision test chart used was developed for the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study, or ETDRS, where changes of less than five letters are typically viewed as within the margin of error for this test. The ETDRS chart includes 11 rows of five letters per row. 
 24

Visual acuity data were collected at each follow-up visit for patients during the three pivotal trials for the KXL system and its associated Photrexa formulations; however, change in visual acuity was not a pre-specified efficacy endpoint in any of the three pivotal trials. Visual acuity data and results were submitted to the FDA, but the FDA did not include visual acuity data or claims in the approved product labeling. Further, we make no claims about improved visual acuity associated with the use of our products. Rather, the observed findings below are only ancillary and are not key trial results. The graph below depicts the visual acuity data for UVX-002, the multi-center clinical trial for the treatment of progressive keratoconus, and is representative of the outcomes in the single-center UVX-001 trial. 
 
Epi-On Procedure for the Treatment of Keratoconus 
 We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of our latest generation KXL system and its associated drug formulations that are designed to allow for corneal cross-linking to be used in an Epi-On procedure for the treatment of patients with progressive keratoconus. We are conducting this trial under an SPA with the FDA on the trial design, endpoints and analyses. The SPA provides that the clinical trial design sufficiently addresses the key endpoints which, if met, we believe may form the basis of a supplemental NDA approval for our latest-generation KXL system, its associated investigational drug formulations and our investigational Boost Goggles for the treatment of progressive keratoconus in an Epi-On procedure. We are currently enrolling patients at ten U.S. clinical sites, with approximately 54% of enrollment completed as of December 31, 2018. 
 The Phase 3 clinical trial is a multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled trial in approximately 275 trial eyes with progressive keratoconus. The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Epi-On corneal cross-linking in slowing the progression of, and reducing, maximum corneal curvature in keratoconic eyes. Trial eyes are randomized to receive either corneal cross-linking with our proprietary drug formulations or placebo. 
 Each treated eye receives only a single course of treatment and the trial eyes are followed for approximately 12 months. After receiving treatment, trial eyes in the treatment group are assessed at day 1, day 3, week 1 and months 1, 3, 6 and 12. Trial eyes in the placebo group follow a similar assessment schedule until month 6. After the month 6 visit, eyes in the placebo group may receive the Epi-On procedure and be followed for another six months. 
 The primary endpoint in the trial is a differential of equal to or greater than 1.0 diopter in change in Kmax from baseline over a six-month period between the treatment and placebo groups. 
 25

Vision Correction 
 We believe corneal cross-linking represents an effective means of reducing or eliminating eyeglasses or contact lens dependence in patients requiring lower-level refractive error correction, including for presbyopia, low myopia and post-cataract refractive error, in addition to several other applications. We have demonstrated proof-of-concept and safety of our zonal corneal cross-linking procedure through investigator-initiated and sponsored clinical trials outside the United States, which we believe support further clinical development of our Mosaic system and its associated drug formulations and seeking FDA approval for use in the treatment of presbyopia as a first indication. 
Phase 2a Clinical Trial of our Mosaic System and Associated Drug Formulations 
 We plan to initiate a Phase 2a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, open-label trial in the first half of 2019 to evaluate the use of our Mosaic system and its associated drug formulations, along with our Boost Goggles, for zonal corneal cross-linking as a vision improvement solution for presbyopic patients. The objectives of the trial are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and comparative efficacy of three candidate treatment patterns. We believe the findings will allow us to select the most effective zonal UVA treatment pattern to employ in subsequent clinical trials. 
 The trial will be conducted at approximately five clinical sites outside of the United States, and will enroll approximately 75 presbyopic patients between the ages of 42 and 65. After screening, subjects will be randomized to receive the treatment in one of three treatment patterns. After treatment, patients will be followed at day 1, week 1 and months 1, 3, 6 and 12. 
 We expect interim data to inform product modifications and further clinical trial development. We expect to begin enrollment in a Phase 2b clinical trial utilizing the Mosaic system, our investigational Boost Goggles and an investigational Epi-On drug formulation in the United States in the first half of 2020. 
 Independent Retrospective Study of Corneal Cross-Linking 
 An independent retrospective study published in 2015, which observed non-U.S. patients who had received treatment for keratoconus substantially similar to ours, observed a treatment success rate of over 90% with average follow-up of approximately 11 years. In this study, maximum corneal curvature was significantly reduced following the corneal cross-linking treatment and remained significantly lower than pre-operative values at ten years. Additionally, corrected distance visual acuity was also significantly improved at ten years relative to pre-operative values, which the authors of the study attributed to the reductions in astigmatism and corneal distortion, and to an improved contact lens fit enabled by regularization of the corneal surface. Two patients in the study underwent repeat cross-linking due to further progression of the disease, after five years and ten years respectively, and both cases subsequently showed stabilization of corneal curvature. Two additional independent retrospective studies evaluated non-U.S. patients who had received treatment with follow-up of seven years, and the long-term stability of cross-linking was also observed in these studies. 
Research and Development 
 Product Evolution 
 The UV-X device, a first-generation UVA delivery device, was used in the clinical trials UVX-001, UVX-002 and UVX-003, which formed the basis of the NDA for our KXL system and its associated drug formulations. During review of the NDA, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, requested us to conduct a bench-top bridging test to demonstrate UVA equivalence between the KXL system that we were seeking marketing approval for and the UV-X device that was used in the clinical trials. Prior to conducting the test, CDRH reviewed and agreed to the test protocol and acceptance criteria. Based on the equivalence test results, which showed that all tests results were observed to be within the acceptance criteria, CDRH deemed that we had demonstrated the comparability equivalence of the two devices. 
Overview 
 We have invested, and continue to invest, in building strong internal research and development capabilities in drug discovery, biomedical optics, machine vision and computational modeling, which we believe will allow us to continue to innovate and maintain our competitive position. As of December 31, 2018, our research and development department consisted of 22 individuals, with a combined scientific track record comprising over 200 publications, 6,500 forward citations and 70 patents. 
 26

Our research and development function is divided into four teams: drug development, systems development, software development and advanced algorithms, all of which report to our Vice President of Research and Development. Maintaining a strong cadence of new applications for corneal cross-linking is an integral part of our strategy. The major focus of our research and development team is to leverage our drug and device platform for new applications. This includes technology research and development efforts directed towards next-generation UVA delivery devices, next-generation cross-linking drugs and related accessories, and the development of device software to support our products. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 In the United States, we sell our products through a direct sales organization that, as of December 31, 2018, consisted of 18 sales professionals, including a regional sales director, local sales managers, field reimbursement specialists and third party payor relations directors. 
 Our sales organization is primarily responsible for training ophthalmologists about the ease-of-use, convenience and cost-effectiveness of our platform and helping these physicians integrate the technology into their practices. Our platform is easy to use and requires a minimal learning curve. Our KXL and Mosaic systems have easy-to-use interfaces that guide physicians through the treatment and have built-in self-calibration. Ophthalmologists are familiar with the techniques used in our corneal cross-linking procedure, such as epithelium removal, application of eye drops and the use of eye-tracking devices. We believe the ease of use, reliability of our devices and broad potential uses of our Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform are key factors in increasing ophthalmologist adoption and enabling our platform to become an integral part of ophthalmology practices. 
 Our reimbursement team consists of staff that work directly with provider practices to help them understand the reimbursement process, as well as staff that calls directly on private payors in order to advocate for coverage and establish payment for our products. 
 Over the next few years, we plan to expand the size and reach of our direct U.S. sales organization as demand for our cross-linking procedure increases and the reimbursement environment continues to develop. We continue to recruit experienced sales professionals with extensive sales and/or clinical experience in ophthalmic medical technologies. We invest significant time and expense to provide comprehensive training to our sales professionals so that they are proficient in all aspects of our products, including features and benefits, procedure techniques. In addition, we provide technical education regarding the cornea and diagnosis of keratoconus. 
 Outside the United States, we sell our products through a broad network of distribution partners located in markets where we see potential for cross-linking usage. We have sold our products into more than 80 countries. We will monitor our international sales progress and may consider conversion to a direct sales approach on a country-by-country basis, depending on our assessment of market conditions, net sales and profitability trends, reimbursement coding and coverage potential, and other 
factors. As of December 31, 2018, we had agreements with approximately 42 distributor organizations. Our top two distributors accounted for 11.5% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 Our global sales efforts and promotional activities are currently aimed at ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals. Our primary customers include ophthalmologists, hospitals and ASCs. We provide physicians with a training program prior to performing cross-linking consisting of in-servicing in the physician office. 
 We work nationally and in our local markets to educate diagnosing providers (primarily optometrists) about keratoconus and the signs and symptoms of the disease. These efforts are intended to facilitate proper diagnosis and treatment of patients. 
 We support the growth of our keratoconus market through direct-to-consumer marketing initiatives. These efforts consist of approaches online and on social media where we work to educate newly diagnosed keratoconus patients, and provide information regarding treatment centers near them as well as providing insurance and other clinical information. 
 27

We support our revenue growth with marketing programs and initiatives designed to build awareness and appreciation for our platform and corneal cross-linking generally. These include participating in eye care industry conferences, as well as advertisements and editorial coverage in professional publications. 
 Private Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 
 U.S. Reimbursement 
 There are three key components for reimbursement in the United States: (1) coding, (2) coverage and (3) payment. Coding refers to distinct numeric and alphanumeric billing codes that are used by healthcare providers to report the provision of medical procedures and the use of supplies for specific patients to payors. Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, or HCPCS, code set are broken into different categories of codes: (1) HCPCS Level I, which includes CPT codes, and are managed by the American Medical Association, or AMA, (Category I, II and III) and (2) HCPCS Level II, which includes items and services such as ambulance, drugs and durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies. 
 The corneal cross-linking procedure for the treatment of keratoconus was granted a Category III CPT code from the AMA in 2016. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, or CMS, created a HCPCS Level II product-specific J code for our Photrexa formulations. The HCPCS code became effective on January 1, 2019. 
 Coverage refers to decisions made by individual private payors as to whether or not to provide their members access to and pay for a specific procedure and related supplies, and if so, under what conditions (i.e., for which specific diagnoses and clinical indications). Payors typically base coverage decisions on reviews of clinical evidence presented in published peer-reviewed medical literature. Currently, we have coverage from 63 private payors, covering a total of up to 170 million covered lives. 
 Payment refers to the amount paid to providers for specific procedures and supplies. Separate payment may be established for the cross-linking procedure and for Photrexa formulations. We offer a number of resources, including the Avedro Reimbursement Customer Hub, or ARCH, program, and a customer-focused field team educating providers on working with their private payors to receive appropriate reimbursement. The ARCH program educates on and assists with coverage and reimbursement questions related to the cross-linking procedure involving the KXL system and Photrexa formulations, provides no-charge drug to uninsured or government-insured patients who meet financial eligibility criteria and, for a limited time, offers healthcare providers a discount on future purchases of Photrexa formulations in certain qualifying circumstances. We have not signed a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement for our Photrexa formulations, and therefore, payment for the Photrexa formulations is not available under Medicare and may not be available under some or all state Medicaid plans. 
 Codes to Specifically Identify the Collagen Cross-Linking Procedure 
 In 2016, the AMA established a Category III CPT code for corneal cross-linking. Category III codes may expire five years after the date they become effective. Prior to expiration, a company can submit an application to convert the Category III code to a Category I code or submit an application for a five-year extension of Category III status.  In November 2018, we also received a product-specific J code from CMS for our Photrexa formulations, and the code became effective on January 1, 2019. Prior to January 1, 2019, a miscellaneous J code could be used for our Photrexa formulations. 
 Coverage of Corneal Cross-Linking by Private Payors 
 As most keratoconic patients are under the age of 40, reimbursement through Medicare is not a priority. We have not signed a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement for our Photrexa formulations, and therefore, payment for the Photrexa formulations is not available under Medicare, and may not be available under some or all state Medicaid plans. As a result, we estimate our target addressable market to exclude most Medicare beneficiaries and we have focused our efforts on establishing coverage and reimbursement with private payors. In the United States, there are hundreds of private payors participating in the commercial insurance market. However, only a handful of private payors, such as Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shields and Cigna, cover the majority of our private payor patient population. 
 28

Shortly after we received FDA approval for our KXL system and associated Photrexa formulations for the treatment of progressive keratoconus and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery and launched U.S. commercialization of our KXL system, physician practices and patients began submitting claims to their insurance companies. Based on review of the clinical evidence and a comparison to the alternative solutions for corneal ectatic disorders, private payors began establishing coverage policies. From January 2017 to December 2018, the number of private payors covering corneal cross-linking treatments increased from three to 63, and covered lives increased from 23 million to up to 170 million, which includes 27 million lives covered by United Healthcare, which in May 2018 changed its negative coverage policy to neutral. We believe the uptake trend of private payor coverage has been very encouraging. To drive physician adoption in the United States, we plan to continue our active discussions with private payors to establish positive national and regional coverage policies and facilitate patient and physician processing of claims. 
 Payment Policies for Corneal Cross-Linking Procedures 
 Payment for a corneal cross-linking procedure as a treatment for corneal ectatic disorders is comprised of payment for the physician service and typically a separate drug payment for the Photrexa formulations. In general, each private payor establishes its own reimbursement policies and rates for procedures in physicians’ offices and facilities, although private payors often reference Medicare’s methodology and payment rate for those procedures. However, final reimbursement may be informed by alternate data or provider contracts. For example, private payors may base their payments to physicians on rates determined under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS. 
 Private payors use a variety of reimbursement methodologies and guidelines to reimburse for physician services. Possible methods include, among others, payment based on established fee schedules, including the MPFS, or payment based on a charge-related basis. Payments for CPT codes under the MPFS are based on the review of the Relative Value Update Committee and valuation by CMS. Medicare does not establish payment rates for Category III CPT codes on the MPFS. As a result, individual Medicare contractors establish their own payment rates for services described by Category III CPT codes. 
 Corneal cross-linking is largely performed in physicians’ offices, and our target patient population is concentrated in the private payor segment. In this situation, adequate and favorable reimbursement for the procedure is often a result of successful negotiation with private payors. 
 Since our U.S. commercial launch in September 2016, we have seen tremendous improvements in private payor coverage for the corneal cross-linking procedure. However, we believe payment policies have been inconsistent and inadequate in some cases, due to lack of formal coverage assessment by private payors, confusion around the miscellaneous J code and an inexperienced physician community trying to navigate the complications and complexity that is inherent in third-party payment systems. Our physician customers must typically bill the costs and fees for our corneal cross-linking procedure directly to the patient or payor, as appropriate, for patients enrolled in commercial insurance plans. Because there is often varied reimbursement for supplies and drugs of new surgical procedures, the additional cost or negotiations necessary to achieve appropriate reimbursement to use our products may affect the profit margin of the practice where the corneal cross-linking procedure is performed. 
 With the implementation of the product-specific J code in January 2019, we expect to see payment policy variability stabilize in the near term, and eventually become a pass-through cost for physician practices. We believe pursuing favorable payment policies with private payors will substantially expand patient access. 
 Self-Payment of Vision Correction Procedures 
 In contrast, vision correction procedures are generally not covered by insurance and are paid for out-of-pocket by the patient. If we receive FDA approval for the Mosaic system and its associated drug formulations to perform vision correction procedures for the treatment of presbyopia, we would expect providers to establish a price per procedure that is self-paid and competitive with current self-paid vision correction procedures, such as LASIK. 
 29

Adoption, Coverage and Cost-Effectiveness Research of Cross-Linking Outside the United States 
 Corneal cross-linking has a long and well-established history outside the United States. In the European Union, corneal cross-linking has been available in every country for more than a decade, and it has been available in Canada since 2008. In 2013, the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, issued guidance stating that evidence on the safety and efficacy of the Epi-Off corneal cross-linking procedure for the treatment of keratoconus and keratectasia is adequate in quality and quantity. In 2015, the Global Delphi Panel of Keratoconus and Ectatic Diseases, an international expert panel of ophthalmologists and clinical researchers, endorsed corneal cross-linking for the treatment of progressive keratoconus, and recommended using corneal cross-linking to prevent disease progression in keratoconic patients as soon as keratoconus is definitively diagnosed. In May 2018, corneal cross-linking was added to the Australia Medicare Benefits Scheme. Corneal cross-linking is also covered in the United Kingdom and France. 
 There have also been several studies conducted outside the United States supporting private payor adoption of policies to cover corneal cross-linking treatments. In 2017, a study published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology evaluated the cost-effectiveness of corneal cross-linking for the treatment of progressive keratoconus from the payor’s perspective in the Netherlands, and showed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, or ICER, associated with corneal cross-linking for progressive keratoconus was €10,149 per quality-adjusted life-year, or QALY, or $11,163 per QALY when adjusted for the effect of cross-linking over ten years. 
 A study by the UK National Health Service also showed that corneal cross-linking is cost effective for progressive keratoconus, as compared to standard management, at an incremental cost of £3,174 per QALY over 25 years. This incremental cost compares favorably against the NICE willingness to pay, or WTP, range of £20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained. 
 Most recently, a Canadian cost-effectiveness analysis estimated that the lifetime costs and QALYs for corneal cross-linking were C$5,530 and 50.12 QALYs. The discounted ICER comparing corneal cross-linking to conventional management with PK was C$9,090 per QALY gained, which falls well below the range of C$20,000 to C$100,000 per QALY and below $50,000 per QALY, which are the thresholds generally used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of health interventions in Canada and the United States. 
 Competition 
 The medical device industry in general, and the ophthalmic medical technology market in particular, are highly competitive and subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities of other participants. While we believe that our proprietary Avedro Corneal Remodeling Platform, development and commercialization experience, scientific knowledge and industry relationships with eye care professionals and healthcare providers provide us with competitive advantages to establish our position as a leading global corneal remodeling company, our currently marketed products are, and any future products we commercialize will be, subject to intense competition. 
 Certain of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, regulatory approval, promotion, sale and support of their products. Our competitors may also have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we do, including relationships with our potential customers. In addition, many of these companies have longer operating histories and greater brand recognition than we do. Because of the size of the keratoconus and vision correction markets and the high growth profile of such markets, we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products. We believe that the principal competitive factors in these markets will include: 
  
• | improved outcomes for patients and other product quality issues;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | product innovation;
--+--------------------


• | acceptance by ophthalmic surgeons;
--+-----------------------------------


• | ease of use and reliability;
--+-----------------------------


• | regulatory status and speed to market;
--+---------------------------------------


• | product price and procedure price; and
--+---------------------------------------


• | reputation for technical leadership.
--+-------------------------------------

We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors in regard to any one or all of these factors. 
 Corneal Ectatic Disorders Market 
 In the United States, our KXL system is the first and only FDA-approved corneal cross-linking treatment to slow or arrest disease progression. However, we are aware that some providers who are not currently our customers are promoting corneal cross-linking for the treatment of keratoconus and we believe these providers are primarily using products from CXLUSA or PeschkeTrade GmBH, a Swiss corporation. iVeena Delivery Systems recently announced the commencement of a Phase 1/2a pilot clinical trial for a twice-daily eye drop for the treatment of keratoconus. We are not currently aware of any other companies that are conducting ongoing clinical trials for FDA approval for the treatment of corneal ectatic disorders using a corneal cross-linking procedure. 
 Outside the United States, our primary competitors in the corneal ectatic disorder market offer for sale devices and drug product for corneal cross-linking procedures, including PeschkeTrade, EMAGine, IROS, LIGHTMED Corporation, NVILaser, SERVImed, SOOFT italia S.p.A. and Appasamy Associates. Several of these companies offer lower-cost solutions for corneal cross-linking. None of these companies currently offer a device that uses digital UVA beam-forming technology in conjunction with real-time eye tracking, which our Mosaic system uses to induce cross-linking in a targeted zone. 
 Vision Correction Market 
 Our initial clinical focus in the vision correction market is on the treatment of patients with presbyopia. Our primary competitors in this market are mainly competitors that are developing corneal inlay surgical solutions for presbyopia, such as Presbia, LLC, which is in the process of obtaining FDA approval for a proprietary optical lens implant for treating presbyopia, Allotex Inc., which is developing shaped human corneal grafts for inlay, and Gebauer Medizintechnik GmbH, which offers an inlay procedure outside of the United States using human donor tissue. Other primary competitors in this market are developing pharmaceutical therapies for presbyopia, including Novartis, which is developing a drug to permanently soften the lens. 
 We believe there is a significant clinical unmet need for patients suffering from presbyopia who are seeking an alternative to invasive surgical procedures and prefer not to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses. Although we currently do not have any FDA-approved products to treat presbyopia, we believe that our Mosaic system, which is currently approved in non-U.S. jurisdictions, may address the critical challenges of currently available vision correction procedures, as corneal remodeling does not involve cutting or ablating the cornea. For example, the non-invasive nature of PiXL, which is currently an approved procedure outside the United States performed using our device, offers an alternative to conventional refractive surgery for patients that are not optimal candidates for LASIK or PRK due to abnormalities in corneal shape, corneal weakness, thin corneas, other risk factors for surgical complications or a reluctance to undergo surgery. Other competitors developing non-surgical treatment options for presbyopia include Allergan plc, Presbyopia Therapies, LLC, Clerio Vision, Inc. and TECLens, LLC. We expect that any such treatment options that are successfully developed could eventually be available both within and outside the United States. 
 If we obtain FDA approval for additional applications of our platform for vision correction, such as to treat presbyopia, we believe the main driver in this highly competitive market will be leveraging our call points in order to cross-sell these additional applications of our devices, since the vision correction market shares the same target customer as the corneal ectatic disorder market. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for commercially important technology, proprietary processes, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, protect trademarks that are integral to our international marketing and branding strategies, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”

Patents 
 As of March 1, 2019, our patent portfolio included 25 active patent families. Our patent portfolio consisted of 42 issued utility patents globally, of which 15 were issued as U.S. patents and 21 were under exclusive license from third parties. The issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2027 and 2036. We own 19 utility patents and exclusively in-license 20 utility patents covering product candidates in the United States, Japan, German, France, Great Britain, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. These patents expire between 2027 and 2036. Additionally, we own four utility patents and exclusively in-license one utility patent covering procedures in the United States, with expiration dates between 2029 and 2036. We own two utility patents covering drug formulations in Italy, with expiration dates in 2027 and 2030. We are pursuing patent protection under 44 pending non-provisional national patent applications in various jurisdictions, of which 14 were pending U.S. patents and three were pending PCT applications still due for national phase filings. Over the next 12 months, we plan to file at least five new non-provisional applications based on pending provisional patent applications. 
 Our current patent portfolio is directed to technologies we have developed in fields relating to corneal cross-linking treatments including, but not limited to, photoactivation of cross-linking drugs, drug formulations, drug delivery, eye-tracking, treatment monitoring and biomechanical measurement. We regularly review the assets in our patent portfolio and evaluate where the portfolio fits in the intellectual property landscape in those countries where we intend to make, have made, use, offer for sale, or sell devices. We believe our patent portfolio is aligned with our current and future commercial goals. We continue to seek patent protection in the United States and other countries for proprietary technologies that are important to our business. Our patent strategy is guided by a strong understanding of the industry in which we do business and the companies against whom we compete. We consistently mine the results of our research and development activities to identify patentable aspects of our devices and any other inventions that are important to maintaining an advantage over our competitors. For example, we can identify opportunities to gain a competitive advantage by strategically blocking others from practicing key technologies. 
 Patent Applications 
 The process for obtaining patent protection for an invention starts with drafting and filing a patent application with one or more patent offices in respective jurisdictions. According to the patent laws enacted by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in the United States and the patent laws that have been in effect in most foreign jurisdictions in which we seek patent protection, the applicant who is the first to file an application gains priority over other applicants, even if the other applicants were actually earlier to invent. As such, there is a greater need to draft and file applications expediently once we have decided that patent protection for a particular invention is important. We implement best practices for preparing patent applications to enable a quick turnaround without sacrificing quality. We also work with intellectual property counsel to ensure that we properly file patent applications and take any other appropriate steps, such as requiring non-disclosure agreements before publicly disclosing any aspects of our important inventions. 
 To start the patent application drafting process, our inventors typically prepare documentation detailing the invention and then coordinate with an IP Committee to review and approve the invention for possible patent protection. The IP Committee includes at least our Vice President of Research & Development, Chief Medical Officer, Vice President of Marketing, our General Counsel and our intellectual property counsel. Working with our intellectual property counsel, we draft a patent application based on the documentation from the inventors. The patent application provides a detailed description of the primary embodiments of the invention contemplated by the inventors as well as alternative embodiments. In addition to claims directed to the primary embodiments, the patent application typically includes claims directed to aspects of alternative embodiments, so that competitors find it more difficult to work around the patent. In addition, claims directed to aspects of alternative embodiments might block competitors from actually practicing their preferred technology even if we do not intend to practice the alternative embodiments ourselves. Furthermore, the claims of a patent application can be later modified to incorporate aspects of alternative embodiments to reflect subsequent changes or developments in commercially relevant technologies in the industry. 
 In some cases, we may prepare and file a non-provisional patent application directly after we have identified a patentable invention. We have, however, incorporated the filing of U.S. provisional patent applications into our patent filing strategy, especially as a way to establish the earliest possible filing dates for first-to-file patent systems. A provisional patent application preserves the filing date for one year, by which time the applicant must file a non-provisional patent application directed to the same subject matter in order to maintain the priority of the provisional patent application filing date. A provisional patent application must meet fewer formal requirements than a non-provisional patent application and thus may allow a patent application to be filed more quickly. A provisional patent application also gives the applicant time to continue business activities to determine whether an invention is commercially feasible and/or sufficiently important to pursue patent protection under a non-provisional patent application. Our provisional patent applications provide a sufficiently detailed description of the primary and alternative embodiments to ensure that our invention is entitled to the priority date associated with the provisional patent application. 
 32

Within the year after an initial provisional patent application is filed, there may be further developments to technology relating to the invention disclosed in the initial provisional patent application. In such cases, we may file one or more additional provisional patent applications to describe such developments. The additional provisional patent applications can then be consolidated with the initial provisional patent application into a single non-provisional patent application. The single non-provisional patent application must be filed before the initial provisional application expires one year after its filing. A non-provisional patent application based on more than one provisional patent application generally describes many different embodiments, giving us the ability to develop claims that are directed to different patentable features. 
 When we eventually file non-provisional applications, we work with our intellectual property counsel to draft a set of claims that covers the invention and provides the broadest patent protection possible. The claim drafting process includes an analysis of the prior art to enhance the chances of allowance of the claims over prior art that may be cited during examination of the patent application. Although we may consider ordering a formal prior art search by a professional firm, we typically conduct our prior art searches in-house. Because our research and development activities are highly specialized and require an up-to-date understanding of the state of the art, we are usually better suited to identify the most relevant prior art. Our understanding of the state of the art is, among other things, based on reviewing current research disclosed in scientific/technical publications and conferences as well as reviewing the patent references therein. 
 The claims in an application may include apparatus or system claims to protect structural aspects of our inventions. Additionally or alternatively, the claims may include method claims to protect the manner in which our inventions are operated, e.g., for medical procedures, and/or produced. To determine the most appropriate types of claims to file, we consider how the claims may be enforced. For example, when enforcing a patent against an infringing manufacturer, apparatus or system claims protecting structural aspects of one of our inventions may be more appropriate than method claims that cover medical procedures that use the invention, since such method claims for medical procedures in general are directly infringed by users of the invention (e.g., medical practitioners) rather than manufacturers. In addition, we consider whether the claims constitute patent eligible subject matter in the given jurisdiction. For example, many foreign jurisdictions prohibit method claims that recite steps for performing a medical procedure on a human subject. 
 Once the claims are completed, we draft the rest of the application and typically file a U.S. application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and an international Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application with the World International Patent Organization. A PCT application can be used as the basis for subsequent national phase filings in any of the member countries who have signed onto the PCT agreement. The member countries include most industrialized countries. Thus, the PCT application gives us the option of filing for patent protection in foreign jurisdictions that are of interest to us. We have selectively filed foreign applications in the European Patent Office, or EPO, Japan, China and South Korea. When granted, applications with the EPO allow us to obtain corresponding patent protection in individual EU member states. Rather than filing in as many foreign countries as possible to protect an invention, we identify the jurisdictions where patent protection will be more commercially effective, such as jurisdictions where we intend to make, have made, use, offer for sale or sell devices. In addition, we also consider whether a given jurisdiction would deem an invention to be patent eligible subject matter. 
 Our non-provisional patent applications generally describe many different embodiments, and the claims can be directed to different patentable features. As such, a single non-provisional patent application (parent) can provide the basis for a large family of related non-provisional patent applications (children). In some cases, a patent examiner may require us to restrict examination in a parent patent application to an elected subset of claims directed to a single identifiable invention, in which case we may file divisional patent applications directed to unelected claims. In other cases, we may file continuation patent applications with claims directed to previously unclaimed features that have since become more commercially relevant. In yet other cases, we may file a continuation-in-part, or CIP, application in the United States to claim new subject matter related to the initial invention. Such new subject matter, for example, may be directed to improvements to the initial invention, which by themselves may be less appropriate for a separate patent family. Before filing CIP applications, we weigh the benefits of claiming priority to the parent patent applications against the loss of patent term, as the term of a child patent application depends on the term of the parent patent application. 
 Monitoring Third-Party Activity 
 Our knowledge of the industry allows us to identify and closely monitor third parties whose activities may impact our business. These third parties may be competing companies who are practicing technologies protected by our patents. Where necessary, we will defend and enforce our patents against such companies. 
 33

In addition, to understand the IP landscape, we consistently conduct searches for relevant patents and patent applications filed by third parties. We regularly search both U.S. and foreign patent databases using the names of competing companies, research institutions, inventors, and researchers who are known to be involved in the industry and/or relevant scientific/technological fields. We also search the patent databases according to relevant search classifications and concepts (keywords). We typically conduct these searches in-house with the assistance of our intellectual property counsel using the in-depth knowledge we have on the state of the industry and art. 
 If we identify a potentially relevant patent during our searches, we conduct a freedom-to-operate analysis to ensure that we can operate without infringing the patent. For a potentially relevant patent application, we regularly monitor the progress of the application during the examination to ensure that any granted claims will not interfere with our freedom to operate. Where possible, we may intervene in the examination and/or grant of the patent application, such as via third-party submission, reexamination or opposition. 
 Furthermore, our searches may identify opportunities for us to obtain patent protection by acquiring or licensing potentially relevant patents and/or patent applications from third parties.

 Our marketing department works closely with our intellectual property counsel and brings them in early and often to select protectable marks based on, for example, the availability, marketing appeal, strength, acceptability for registration, and acceptability for regulatory approval of the marks. For important marks, we develop a registration strategy that is informed by the commercial activities and opportunities for the branded products associated with such marks. Generally, we file for registration in our most important markets first and then seek registration in additional countries as those markets become commercially relevant, taking advantage of priority claims when possible. Our trademark portfolio is strengthened by our use of appropriate trademark symbols in connection with the marks and by monitoring the marketplace to ensure that our marks are not impermissibly used by others. 
 As of March 1, 2019, our trademark portfolio included 56 trademark registrations, of which ten were registered U.S. trademarks, and 19 pending trademark applications covering various products and services in the United States, the European Union, Canada, China, Japan and South Korea, of which five were pending U.S. trademarks. The trademarks for which we have received or applied for registration are: Avedro, KXL, KXL II, PiXL, Lasik Xtra, Vibex, Vibex Xtra, Vibex Rapid, Photrexa, ParaCel, See Strong, The World Leader In Corneal Cross-Linking Science, The World Leader in Corneal Remodeling, CuRV, Boost Goggles, Mosaic, ZXL, AK Xtra and KeraFlex.
 Trade Secrets 
 Some inventions cannot be reverse engineered or would be difficult to reverse engineer from the products that we sell. Additionally, some inventions are directed to subject matter that does not constitute patent eligible subject matter, such as algorithms, computer programs per se and collections of data. In such cases, we consider protecting our technologies as trade secrets rather than protecting them by filing patent applications. To protect these inventions as trade secrets, we institute protections to keep the inventions secret. For example, we require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. 
 We also require our employees and consultants who work on our technologies to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the term of their employment, while using our property or for inventions which relate to our business. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our technologies or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights of related or resulting know-how and inventions. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. 
 Infringement 
 The medical device and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement. As the number of entrants into our market increases, the risk of an infringement claim being brought against us grows. While we attempt to ensure that our technologies and methods do not infringe third parties’ patents and proprietary rights, our competitors may assert that our products or systems, and the methods we employ, are covered by patents held by them. In addition, our competitors may assert that future products and methods we may employ infringe their patents. If third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling the affected product. 
 34

In the future, we may also need to engage in litigation to enforce our issued patents, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our products, any of which could severely harm our business. 
 Intellectual Property Agreements 
 CalTech 
 In February 2015, we entered into a license agreement with the California Institute of Technology, or CalTech, which was amended and restated, or the Amended CalTech Agreement, in its entirety in July 2017. The Amended CalTech Agreement is an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in the United States to certain patent rights granting us the right to make, have made, import, use, sell and offer for sale any product, device, system, article of manufacture, machine, composition of matter or process or service in the field of corneal cross-linking through the use of UVA light. However, the license grant specifically excludes the use of visible light and cross-linking in any non-corneal tissue such as the sclera. Under the Amended CalTech Agreement, we agreed to pay CalTech a high single digit royalty on net revenue derived from the sale or distribution of cross-linking agents for performing cross-linking procedures in the United States that are substantially concurrent with corneal surgically invasive corrective procedures, including, but not limited to, LASIK or PK, the royalty products, but excluding procedures for the treatment of keratoconus. The agreement includes certain other payments including (1) an initial payment in the low five digits, (2) a low single digit dollar royalty per treatment on the sale of cross-linking agents for treatment of keratoconus, as well as a minimum annual royalty in the low five digits for such procedures, (3) a percentage in the mid-double digits of certain non-royalty sublicensing revenue and (4) development and regulatory milestone payments in the low to mid six digits in the aggregate. Royalties are payable on a product-by-product basis until December 5, 2029. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the Amended CalTech Agreement expires on the later of the expiration, revocation, invalidation or unenforceability of the licensed patents and the date that royalties are no longer payable. Either party may terminate the Amended CalTech Agreement upon an uncured material breach of the other party. Additionally, CalTech may terminate the Amended CalTech Agreement upon an uncured payment default by us or our bankruptcy or insolvency. 
 IROC 
 In August 2014, we entered into an asset purchase and license agreement with IROC Innocross AG, or IROC, which we refer to as the IROC Asset Purchase Agreement, to acquire certain assets, including a list of customers and certain agreements, as well as a fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide, nonexclusive license to certain patents, granting us the right to import, manufacture, develop, use, advertise, merchandise, promote, publicize, sell and distribute devices and drugs used in corneal cross-linking. The total purchase price was CHF2.5 million, to be paid in specified delineated installments. 
 In April 2015, we entered into a patent license and purchase agreement with IROC, or the IROC IP Agreement, to expand the scope of the IROC Asset Purchase Agreement. The IROC IP Agreement granted us a worldwide, exclusive license to certain additional patents to research, develop, make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, sell and otherwise commercialize additional corneal cross-linking technologies. Additionally, under the IROC IP Agreement, upon the payment of the last remaining payment required under the agreement, which include (1) the $50,000 upfront payment and (2) milestone payments of up to $1.7 million in the aggregate, the additional patents will be transferred to us. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals for drugs and devices in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other competent authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 35

Drug-Device Combination Products 
 A combination product is the combination of two or more regulated components, such as drug/device, that are combined or mixed and produced as a single entity, packaged together in a single package or as a unit or a drug or device packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug or device where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication or effect. A combination product is assigned to a center within the FDA that has primary jurisdiction over its regulation, which determines the product’s approval pathway. 
 To determine which FDA center or centers will review a combination product candidate submission, companies may submit a request for assignment to the FDA. Those requests may be handled formally or informally. In some cases, jurisdiction may be determined informally based on FDA experience with similar products. However, informal jurisdictional determinations are not binding on the FDA. Companies also may submit a formal Request for Designation to the FDA Office of Combination Products. The Office of Combination Products will review the request and make its jurisdictional determination within 60 days of receiving a Request for Designation. 
 The FDA will determine which center or centers within the FDA will review the product candidate and under what legal authority the product candidate will be reviewed. Depending on how the FDA views the product candidates that are developed, FDA may have aspects of the product candidate reviewed by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, though one center will be designated as the center with primary jurisdiction based on the product candidate’s primary mode of action. The FDA determines the primary mode of action based on the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product candidate – the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product candidate. The review of such combination product candidates is often complex and time consuming, as the FDA may select the combination product candidate to be reviewed and regulated by one or multiple of the FDA centers identified above, which could affect the path to regulatory clearance or approval. Furthermore, the FDA may also require submission of separate applications to multiple centers. 
 The post-market requirements that apply to the cleared or approved product will largely be aligned with the agency center determined to have primary jurisdiction over the product candidate and that provided marketing authorization. However, additional post-marketing obligations may apply to specific constituents of the combination product. 
 After providing regulatory clearance or approval, the FDA has discretion in determining post-approval compliance requirements for combination products and could thus require compliance with certain current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements as well as the FDA’s Quality System Requirements, or QSR, if the product includes a device constituent. Other post-market requirements in the same vein as those described above for medical devices and drugs will also apply, depending on the application type and center overseeing regulation of the combination product, including: 
  
• | Other record-keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------------


• | Post-market adverse event, periodic reporting, and Medical Device Reporting requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advertising and promotion requirements;
--+----------------------------------------


• | Restrictions on sale, distribution or use of the product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Requirements for recalls being conducted and recall reporting;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | An order of repair, replacement or refund;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Product tracking requirements; and
--+-----------------------------------


• | Post-market surveillance or clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------

U.S. Review and Approval Processes for Drugs 
 The FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Under the FDCA, new drugs other than biological products (biologics) that are marketed in the United States generally must be FDA-approved under a new drug application, or NDA. The applicable provisions of the FDCA and the implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for preclinical and clinical testing, product development, manufacture, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, reporting, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products and product candidates. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
 The process for obtaining regulatory approval to market a drug or drug-device combination product is expensive, often takes many years, and can vary substantially based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidates involved. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product, or a new drug-device combination product regulated by CDER, in the United States must typically undertake the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable, as may be requested by the FDA to assist with its review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, finished drug product, and in the case of combination drug/device products, the device components, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees, per published Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments, or PDUFA, guidelines for the relevant year, and securing FDA review and approval of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Before testing any investigational biopharmaceutical in human subjects in the United States, a company must generate extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing typically includes laboratory evaluation of product composition and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. In addition, concurrent with clinical trials, companies sometimes complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act. 
 37

IND Application 
 Human clinical trials conducted in the United States cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in initial clinical trials in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. If, within such 30-day window, the FDA raises concerns or questions about planned clinical trials under the IND, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. 
 At any time the FDA may stop clinical trials by placing them on “clinical hold” because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons. The FDA may order a partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed, approved and conducted under the auspices of an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. FDA regulations impose certain obligations upon IRBs related to protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, often referred to as an independent data monitoring committee, or data safety monitoring board or committee. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators and IRBs also must comply with regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial and timely reporting of adverse events. 
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain regulatory requirements in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Such non-IND trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects, and must be accompanied by a sufficient description of actions taken to ensure compliance with GCP requirements in order to be accepted by the FDA. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical trials. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign trials are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND trials. 
 Human clinical trials in the United States are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another: 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. Sponsors sometimes designate their Phase 1 clinical trials as Phase 1a or Phase 1b. Phase 1b clinical trials are typically aimed at confirming dosing, pharmacokinetics and safety in larger number of patients. Some Phase 1b studies evaluate biomarkers or surrogate markers that may be associated with efficacy in patients with specific types of diseases.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 38

 
• | Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled trials that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population, and are designed to develop data regarding the product’s effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained and are intended to gather additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drug’s overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded trials of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the product at the proposed dosing regimen.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. 
 Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials can sometimes be combined or collapsed into a single study protocol, such as when optimal dosing and other questions typically explored in Phase 2 clinical trials are already resolved and where the Phase 2 clinical trial is designed sufficiently to yield adequate and well-controlled clinical data on which the FDA can base an approval decision. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. 
 A study sponsor is required to register post-Phase 1 clinical trials with the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and to submit certain details for public posting on its clinicaltrials.gov database. Registration must occur not later than 21 days after the first patient is enrolled, and the submission must include descriptive information, recruitment information, location and contact information, and other relevant administrative data. Generally within one year of a trial’s completion, outcomes data and related information must be submitted to the NIH for online dissemination. An NDA, NDA supplement and certain other submissions to the FDA require certification of compliance with these clinical trials database requirements. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs must generally contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers from PREA requirements, however, including waivers for certain products that are not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients. 
 Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted. 
 The sponsoring company, the FDA or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. 
 Special Protocol Assessment 
 The Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, process is designed to facilitate the FDA’s review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of certain clinical or animal trials, including clinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug’s efficacy. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor’s questions regarding protocol design and scientific and regulatory requirements. FDA aims to complete SPA reviews within 45 days of receipt of the request. 
 39

The FDA ultimately assesses whether specific elements of the protocol design of the trial, such as entry criteria, dose selection, endpoints and/or planned analyses, are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness of the indication studied. All agreements and disagreements between the FDA and the sponsor regarding an SPA must be clearly documented in an SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA. Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement under the following circumstances: 
  
• | public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, or the director of the review division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the relevant data, assumptions or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A documented SPA may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol. 
 Submission and Review of an NDA by the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017, or PDUFA VI, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a significant human drug application fee, which is collected at the time of submission. PDUFA VI eliminated user fees for supplements and establishments. In addition, the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fee. For federal fiscal year 2018, the submission of an NDA for which clinical data (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) with respect to safety or effectiveness are required for approval is subject to an application user fee of $2,421,495. The annual program user fee for fiscal year 2018 is $304,162. 
 Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. Orphan designated drugs are also exempt from program fees if the drug meets certain public health and revenue criteria. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete before the agency accepts it for filing and conducts substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which the FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date the FDA receives the application. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing, such as API, finished drug product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort, including in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. 
 40

In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. 
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. If the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions: Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval 
 The FDA has certain programs to expedite the development and review of products designed to address an unmet need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These expedited programs are referred to as Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review designation and accelerated approval. The 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, signed into law in December 2016, authorized $500 million in new funding over nine years to help the FDA accelerate review and approval of products and bring new innovations and advances to patients faster and more efficiently. The Cures Act enhances the FDA’s ability to modernize clinical trial designs and clinical outcome assessments to speed the development and review of novel medical products. 
Fast Track 
 The FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 41

Breakthrough Therapy 
 A product may be designated as Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
Priority Review 
 The FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the drug. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs and biological products intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application for the drug or biologic for the proposed rare disease or condition. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the common name of the therapeutic agent and its designated orphan use are publicly disclosed by the FDA. 
 Orphan drug designation does not, by itself, convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If an orphan-designated drug subsequently receives FDA approval for a use or indication that is within the rare disease or condition for which it has been designated, the approved product is entitled to a seven-year orphan exclusivity period, during which the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s application to market the same drug for the same indication. There is one exception to this general rule: if the FDA has previously approved the same drug for the same indication, orphan exclusivity will not be granted unless the sponsor of the subsequent drug can show that its product is clinically superior to the previously-approved drug by means of greater efficacy, greater safety or a major contribution to patient care. 
 42

Exceptions to the seven-year exclusivity period may apply in limited circumstances, such as where the sponsor of a different version of the product is able to demonstrate that its product is clinically superior to the approved orphan drug product or the manufacturer of the orphan designated product cannot assure sufficient quantities of product. In addition, orphan exclusivity does not prevent a competitor from obtaining approval to market a different drug to treat the same disease or condition, or the same drug to treat a different disease or condition. The FDA can revoke a product’s orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the holder of the approved orphan drug application is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet patient needs. Orphan exclusivity operates independently from other regulatory exclusivities and other protections against biosimilar competition, including patents that we hold for our products. 
 A sponsor of a product application that has received an orphan drug designation is also granted tax incentives for clinical research undertaken to support the application. In addition, the FDA may coordinate with the sponsor on research study design for an orphan drug and may exercise its discretion to grant marketing approval on the basis of more limited product safety and efficacy data than would ordinarily be required, based on the limited size of the applicable patient population. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Patent term extensions may also be granted arising from delays generated by pre-approval regulatory review processes. In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension pursuant to 35 USC 156 of up to five years under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The length of the patent term extension is calculated by the USPTO based on the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. It should be noted that in contrast to extensions pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 154 for administrative delays at the USPTO, patent term extension under 35 U.S.C. 156 for regulatory delays at the FDA does not extend to the full scope of the patent claims, but only to the extent they cover the approved product and approved indication upon which the extension was based. In other words, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments do not extend all claims of the subject patent, and the practice of those claims by third parties after the original patent term expires, as extended pursuant to 35 USC 154, may not constitute infringement. A patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent encompassing an approved drug or method of treatment using that drug, may be extended. A patent can only be extended once under 35 U.S.C. 156 and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended one time for one approved product. Once a product is approved, it cannot serve as the basis for patent term extension of another patent at a later time, even if the product is approved for a different indication. 
 Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. Beyond the statute connecting patent term and FDA approval, the two are unrelated. Patent issuance does not affect FDA approval and FDA approval does not affect issuance of a patent. 
 Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Under the PREA, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and any other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 In addition, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA, requires the FDA to meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with drug sponsors. The legislation requires the FDA to meet with drug sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than 90 days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan. 
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless and until the FDA promulgates a regulation stating otherwise, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, unless the orphan-designated product is intended for use in certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. 
 43

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any Orange Book listed patent and any existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied. Rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. Pediatric exclusivity does not extend the term of the patent, but it effectively extends the preclusive effect of the patent on FDA’s authority to approve a competitor’s abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, or 505(b)(2) NDA application. With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which a generic (ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent is valid and infringed by a proposed generic product. 
 505(b)(2) NDAs 
 As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA pursuant to an NDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant does not have a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically and legally appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or to provide additional data, including clinical trials, to support the change from the previously approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the labeled indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Generic Products and Exclusivity 
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme allowing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a marketing application that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredient(s), the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the RLD. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” 
 For drug-device combination products, the FDA expects a generic drug-device combination product to have the same clinical effect and safety profile when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling. The FDA has provided guidance that the generic combination product must be able to be substituted for the brand name product without additional physician intervention and/or retraining prior to use, and with no greater error rate than the error rate shown for the brand name product. 
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” FDA considers a therapeutically equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
 44

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such New Chemical Entity, or NCE, exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA referencing the approved application may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years from the date of the RLD’s approval, unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity is available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, three-year exclusivity blocks only the approval of a competitor drug application, not its submission. In particular, three-year exclusivity blocks approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety for the same conditions of approval. The FDA typically makes decisions about granting exclusivity shortly before a product is approved. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes for Medical Devices 
 Although our products are currently regulated in the United States primarily as drugs, there is a chance that our future products will be classified as medical devices and subject to the jurisdiction of FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health and device regulations. 
 Unless an exemption applies, all medical devices introduced to the U.S. market since 1976 are required by the FDA, as a condition of marketing, to secure either clearance of a 510(k) pre-market notification or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose a low or moderate risk are placed in Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution, unless the device type is exempt from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life supporting or implantable devices or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in Class III, requiring submission and approval of a PMA. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees. 
 FDA 510(k) Pathway 
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMAs. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the notification is submitted, but it can take considerably longer, depending on the extent of FDA’s requests for additional information and the amount of time a sponsor takes to fulfill them. 
 After a 510(k) premarket notification is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. 
 Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device. 
 45

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification, including modification to or deviation from design, manufacturing processes, materials, packaging and sterilization that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA requires a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, the applicant may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until clearance or approval is received. In addition, in these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite 510(k) or PMA application. 
 If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Pursuant to amendments to the FDCA in 2012, a manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk. 
 De Novo Classification 
 Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. 
 This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. 
 FDA PMA Pathway 
 A company must submit a PMA if its device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) clearance or de novo process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical information, preclinical data, clinical trial data, manufacturing data and labeling, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use. 
 46

Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information, such as a major deficiency letter, within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, and a QSR inspection of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application is to take 180 days, although the review generally takes between one and three years or longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including: 
  
• | the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the data from pre-clinical studies and/or clinical trials may be found unreliable or insufficient to support approval;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data are submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which the FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing. 
 New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, components, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change. 
 In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of post-approval studies or postmarket surveillance, whereby the applicant follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may require postmarket surveillance for certain devices approved under a PMA or cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside a device user facility, devices where the failure of which would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences, or devices expected to have significant use in pediatric populations. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use. 
 47

Medical Device Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. In the United States, these trials often require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, if the investigation involves a significant risk device. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product candidate is deemed a non-significant risk device and is eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and appropriate IRBs at the clinical trial sites. 
 FDA Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs and medical devices manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, reviewing adverse event information and literature and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Manufacturers of medical devices are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with cGMP requirements, as well as with the QSR. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Holders of an NDA for a combination product containing a device constituent part are also subject to certain device-related post-approval requirements, such as five-day reporting requirements and device malfunction reporting requirements. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about the safety or effectiveness of a drug or device are prohibited before approval. After approval, a drug or device generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, healthcare professionals are generally permitted to prescribe or administer drugs or devices for uses not described in the applicable labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for 
 48

a manufacturer to engage in non-promotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementation regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCSA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
 Healthcare providers and third party payors play a primary role in the recommendation, prescription, treatment and coverage of procedures and FDA-approved prescription drugs. Arrangements and interactions with healthcare professionals, third party payors and patients, among others, are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. The U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to the following: 

• | the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including discounts or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors and speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as reimbursement support programs, patient assistance programs, educational and research grants, or charitable donations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil False Claims Act prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the federal False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Many pharmaceutical manufacturers have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper activities including causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved and thus non reimbursable uses, and interactions with prescribers and other customers including those that may have affected their billing or coding practices and submission to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs;

 In addition to the foregoing requirements, several state, local and foreign laws now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare professionals and entities in these states. Other states restrict when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals or gifts to prescribers or engage in other marketing-related activities. Other states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives. Other states prohibit various other marketing related activities, including restricting the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes and other states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes of conduct. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws may face civil penalties. 
 State and federal regulatory and enforcement agencies continue to actively investigate violations of healthcare laws and regulations, and the U.S. Congress continues to strengthen the arsenal of enforcement tools. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating certain federal healthcare laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Enforcement agencies also continue to pursue novel theories of liability under these laws. In particular, government agencies recently have increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement activity with respect to manufacturer reimbursement support activities and other patient support programs, including bringing criminal charges or civil enforcement actions under the federal Anti-Kickback statute, civil False Claims Act and violations of healthcare fraud and HIPAA privacy provisions. 
 Compliance with these federal and state laws and regulations requires substantial resources. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, reputational harm, administrative burdens such as integrity oversight and reporting obligations, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Companies settling federal false claims, kickback or Civil Monetary Penalty cases also may be required to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General in order to avoid exclusion from participation (i.e., loss of coverage for their products) in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Corporate Integrity Agreements typically impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance.

For additional information regarding obligations under federal healthcare statues and regulations, refer to the risk factor titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulation—If we fail to comply with healthcare and other regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.” 
 U.S. Data Privacy Laws 
 Under the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requirements for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. HIPAA includes privacy and security rules, breach notification requirements and electronic transaction standards. HIPAA applies to covered entities which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses and health plans, as well as persons and entities that provide services on their behalf that involve PHI, known as business associates. 
 In addition, we may be subject to state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to PHI than HIPAA, and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. 
 Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. 
 Each state in the United States has its own law relating to notification requirements to users and state attorneys’ general and state agencies in the event of data breach (the unauthorized disclosure of or access to users personal data). In addition to its state breach notification requirements, California recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which will come into effect beginning in January 2020. The CCPA has been characterized as the first “GDPR-like” privacy statute to be enacted in the United States because it mirrors a number of the key provisions of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. 
 GDPR 
 EU member states, Switzerland and other countries have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the European Union, the collection and use of personal health data is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018, repealing the Data Protection Directive and increasing our responsibility and liability in relation to the processing of personal data of EU subjects. 
 The GDPR, together with the national legislation of the EU member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the European Union, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. Data protection authorities from the different EU member states may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in the European Union. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.

U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Healthcare Reform Act, which has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Among the ways in which it may impact our business, particularly if in the future Medicare or Medicaid covers or reimburses our drug formulations, the Healthcare Reform Act: 

• | imposes an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, although the effective rate paid may be lower. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, the excise tax was suspended through December 31, 2017, and under the continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018, or 2018 Appropriations Resolution, signed by President Trump on January 22, 2018, was further suspended through December 31, 2019;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expands the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Healthcare Reform Act, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Healthcare Reform Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Healthcare Reform Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Healthcare Reform Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Healthcare Reform Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Healthcare Reform Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, the 2018 Appropriations Resolution delayed the implementation of certain Healthcare Reform Act-mandated fees, including, without limitation, the medical device excise tax. More recently, in July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Healthcare Reform Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Healthcare Reform Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the Healthcare Reform Act and its possible repeal or replacement on our business. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Healthcare Reform Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals for spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 We expect that additional healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future.

U.S. Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Our ability to commercialize our products successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of financial coverage and adequate reimbursement from third party payors, managed care organizations and private health insurers. 
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals in the United States to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably, particularly given the current atmosphere of mounting criticism of prescription drug costs in the United States. We expect to continue to experience pricing pressure in the United States in connection with the sale of our products due to managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, additional legislative proposals to curb healthcare costs and negative publicity regarding pricing and price increases generally, which could limit the prices that we charge for our products, limit our commercial opportunity and/or negatively impact revenues from sales of our products. We anticipate that the Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies impacting pricing that are intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include; pharmaceutical cost transparency bills that aim to require drug companies to justify their prices through required disclosures; controls on healthcare providers; challenges to the pricing of products or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; requirements to try less expensive products or generics before a more expensive branded product; changes in drug importation laws; expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person; and public funding for cost effectiveness research, which may be used by third party payors to make coverage and payment decisions. 
 In addition, drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies is currently, and is expected to continue to be, under close scrutiny, including with respect to companies that have increased the price of products after acquiring those products from other companies. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Third party payors, decide which products can be reimbursed and establish reimbursement and co-pay levels and conditions for reimbursement. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic and/or clinical studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products. Even with studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than other products, and third party payors may not provide and maintain coverage and reimbursement for our products or any of our product candidates that we commercialize, in whole or in part. 
 The process for determining whether a third party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third party payors may limit coverage or may not provide coverage of an approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.

Regulation in the European Union 
 In the European Union, we are required under the European Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC to conduct an assessment of the conformity of our products falling within the definition of a medical device with the obligations laid down in the Medical Devices Directive, where necessary with the participation of a notified body who must issue a related EC Certificate of Conformity, and to affix the CE mark to these medical devices prior to selling the products in EU member states. 
 The CE mark is an EU symbol that represents adherence to certain requirements governing the safety, and performance of the medical device mandated in the European Medical Device Directive. This includes the “Essential Requirements” listed in Annex I to the Directive. Once affixed, the CE mark enables a product to be sold within the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the 28 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. A bi-lateral agreement concluded between the European Union and Switzerland also permits CE marked medical devices to be marketed in Switzerland. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. This includes an evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. The conformity assessment procedure varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile) in relation to which the manufacturer can prepare their own EC Declaration of Conformity following conduct of a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. In the case of medium to high risk (Class IIa, IIb and III) medical devices, including our KXL and Mosaic systems which are Class IIa medical devices, the EC Certificate of Conformity is issued by a notified body. Notified bodies are private organizations that are licensed by the competent authorities of individual EU member states to conduct conformity assessment procedures and to verify the conformity of manufacturers and their medical devices with the Essential Requirements. 
 Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the notified body would typically audit and examine the technical file, the clinical evaluation report and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The notified body issues an EC Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements. This EC Certificate of Conformity must be renewed, generally on a three yearly basis. 
 In 2011, we received a EC Certificate of Conformity from our notified body for our KXL system allowing the CE mark to be affixed to the KXL system. Our existing EC Certificate of Conformity for our KXL system is valid until May 1, 2020. In 2015, we received a EC Certificate of Conformity from our notified body for our Mosaic system allowing the CE mark to be affixed to the Mosaic system. Our existing EC Certificate of Conformity for our Mosaic system is valid until May 1, 2020. 
 Manufacturers must also comply with quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. To facilitate compliance with the Essential Requirements quality system requirements for which the Medical Devices Directive provides, Article 5 of the Medical Devices Directive foresees the possible recourse to harmonized European Standards. Where the reference of these Standards has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, compliance with such Standards will constitute a presumption of conformity with Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive or the quality system requirements laid down in the relevant Annex to the Directive. While compliance with the Essential Requirements and relevant quality system requirements is obligatory, the Standards remain voluntary. However, compliance with the Standards is an effective way of demonstrating compliance with the Essential Requirements and quality management system requirements. 
 The Medical Devices Directive requires manufacturers to maintain a Technical File related to their products demonstrating compliance with the obligations imposed by the Medical Devices Directive. Once the manufacturer has completed the Technical File for the medical device and, where necessary, the EC Certificate of Conformity has been issued, the manufacturer may affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. 
 If we introduce any substantial changes to our medical devices, this could require conduct of an additional conformity assessment process in relation to the substantial changes and modification or preparation of a new Technical File, new EC Certificates of Conformity and new EC Declarations of Conformity. Additionally, we may need to assess the conformity with the Medical Devices Directive and affix a CE mark to any new medical devices that we may develop in the future. 
 54

Products regulated as medical devices according to the Medical Devices Directive are subject to a number of post-marketing regulatory requirements, including establishment of a post-marketing vigilance procedure, requirements for reporting of adverse events, procedures related to conduct of Field Safety Corrective Actions, including product recalls and withdrawals, marketing and promotion of medical devices, interactions with healthcare professionals, registration of medical devices and pricing and reimbursement of medical devices. In some circumstances, issue of an EC Certificate of Conformity by a notified body may also be conditional on our providing undertaking to conduct post-marketing clinical studies. 
 In May 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), or MDR, was adopted. The MDR repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike Directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, the MDR will be directly applicable in the EU member states and on the basis of the EEA agreement in Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The MDR is, among other things, intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The MDR will apply as of May 26, 2020. Once applicable, the MDR will among other things: 
  
• | strengthen the rules on placing medical devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the European Union; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strengthen the rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once applicable, the MDR will impose increased compliance obligations for us to access the EU market. Moreover, the scrutiny imposed by notified bodies for the technical documentation related these devices will increase considerably. 
 Manufacturing and Distribution 
 We currently produce the majority of our KXL and Mosaic systems at our headquarters in Burlington, Massachusetts, with some additional limited manufacturing operations in Dublin, Ireland. We use a mix of custom and off-the-shelf components, which are supplied to us from suppliers per our specifications. We assemble and test our devices for compliance with our specifications before releasing the finished product for shipment to our customers. Our Burlington and Dublin facilities are ISO 13485 compliant. A number of components used in our KXL and Mosaic systems are supplied to us from single source suppliers. We generally acquire our single source components pursuant to purchase orders placed in the ordinary course of business. As such, if one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to perform adequately or fulfill our needs, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to find new suppliers or manufacturers and may also face delays in the development and commercialization of our products. 
 Our ability to supply our products and to develop our products depends, in part, on our ability to successfully obtain in sufficient quantities the active ingredients in our riboflavin drug formulations, as well as the final formulations that have been produced in accordance with FDA requirements. We have entered into manufacturing, supply or quality agreements with our single source suppliers pursuant to which they supply these ingredients and drug formulations. To date, we have not experienced any significant supply constraints or delays in procuring active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, or drug products. 
 We currently have a master services agreement, or MSA, dated November 2012 with Albany Molecular Research Inc., or AMRI. The MSA extends until terminated by either party in accordance with the termination provision, which requires nine months’ notice if terminated by AMRI and 30 days’ notice if terminated by us. In March 2014, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with AMRI, pursuant to which we purchase the API in our riboflavin formulations, which is manufactured exclusively for us, in quantities specified in forecasts provided by us and updated on a rolling basis. This supply agreement has a five-year term, and we are currently negotiating a renewal term. We also recently executed a quality agreement with AMRI to specify which party is responsible for the various cGMP aspects of manufacturing. 
 55

In November 2010, we signed an exclusive supply agreement with Medio-Haus-Medizinprodukte GmbH, or Medio-Haus, in Germany for the products we market outside of the United States. In June 2014, we entered into an amendment to this supply agreement with Medio-Haus, pursuant to which we have exclusive rights to distribute all of their riboflavin drug formulations, including the Medio Cross, Vibex and ParaCel products, subject to ordering certain minimum quantities, in quantities to be specified in forecasts provided by us. This agreement extends exclusively until May 2029. Either we or Medio-Haus may terminate the agreement prior to that date for cause. 
 In December 2014, we entered in to a commercial manufacturing agreement with Ajinomoto Althea pursuant to which Ajinomoto Althea formulates our API into the final drug product. This agreement automatically renews for successive two-year periods following the expiration of the initial term in December 2018.
 Either we or Ajinomoto Althea may terminate the agreement prior to that date without cause upon 24 month’s written notice. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for uncured material breach by, or insolvency of, the other party, and we may terminate the agreement in the event of a change of control of either us or Ajinomoto Althea. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 122 full-time employees with 22 in research and development, business development and laboratory and commercial operations, and 15 in general and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We have also engaged and may continue to engage independent contractors to assist us with operational, clinical, sales and engineering functions.
