These 17 bowling centers contain a total of 682 lanes.

Most locations are equipped for glow-in-the-dark bowling, popular for parties and non-league bowling. The Company outsources the operation of its amusement games to a third party in exchange for a flat annual fee.
 
The bowling equipment essential for the Company's operation is readily available. The Company’s major source of equipment is Brunswick Corporation.
 
The bowling business is a seasonal one, and most of the Company’s business takes place from October through May.

Its primary competitor is Bowlero Corporation and many of our centers face competition from bowling centers located in close proximity to our centers.
