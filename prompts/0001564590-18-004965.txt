Company Overview
 We are a provider of wireless handsets (which may be referred to herein as “phones”, “cell phones”, “mobile phones”, “feature phones” and “smartphones”), tablets and accessories to carriers, distributors and retailers, primarily in Latin America. We define, source and sell our proprietary line of products under the verykool® brand, with the goal to provide the market with products that are unique, handsomely designed, feature rich and provide exceptional “value” for the consumer. Our verykool® products include a wide range of GSM Android-based smartphones and a limited number of feature phones and Android-based tablets.
 Our corporate headquarters are in San Diego, California. We have wholly owned subsidiaries in Mexico, Central America and South America, which conduct some of our business activities in their respective regions, as well as subsidiaries in Hong Kong and China where we source our verykool® products, oversee production at manufacturers, conduct quality control and monitor third party logistics and warehousing for shipment to our customers. We also have sales representatives, field engineers and marketing resources located throughout Latin America, our principal market.
 We incorporated under the laws of the State of California on February 7, 1994, under the name InfoSonics Corporation. On September 11, 2003, we reincorporated under the same name under the laws of and into the State of Maryland.
 On July 25, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended “Merger Agreement”) by and among InfoSonics, Cooltech Holding Corp. (“Cooltech”), and our wholly-owned subsidiary, InfoSonics Acquisition Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Cooltech will merge with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), with Cooltech surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of InfoSonics. The Merger Agreement provides that we will issue an aggregate of 9,375,000 shares of InfoSonics common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of Cooltech.  On September 19, 2017, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC registering the InfoSonics common stock to be issued in exchange for Cooltech’s outstanding capital stock upon consummation of the Merger.  Such registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on February 12, 2018. The Merger Agreement and the Merger were adopted and approved by our stockholders at a special meeting held on March 7, 2018, and the transactions contemplated thereby are subject to a number of customary closing conditions. See Item 1A “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to the Merger” for additional information and risks relating to the Merger.
 Global Wireless Industry
 Today’s wireless handsets can be segmented into two primary categories: smartphones and feature phones. The distinguishing characteristics of smartphones are that they are built on a mobile operating system and are generally more sophisticated, have higher computing power and are more expensive than feature phones. Rapid technological developments within the wireless telecommunications industry have allowed wireless subscribers to talk, send and receive text messages, send and receive e-mails, capture and transmit digital images and videos, send and receive multimedia messages, play games, listen to music, watch visual content, run application programs and browse the Internet using all-in-one wireless handsets. Wireless handsets, accessories and services also are being used around the world to provide remote monitoring, point-of-sale transaction and payment processing, inter-device communications, local area networks, location monitoring, sales force automation and customer relationship management. 
Our Business and Strategy
 The worldwide market for wireless handsets and tablets is extremely competitive. It is characterized by a large number of providers, often with very similar products, that ultimately compete on price at very thin margins. The capabilities and features of the phones are primarily a function of the chipset manufacturers, and it is difficult to achieve differentiation. Despite this, we still strive to achieve the following: (1) a consistent, attractive industrial design, (2) a compelling combination of hardware and software features, (3) a quality product with low failure rate, and (4) an attractive price point, which together provide exceptional “value” to the consumer.
 Our strategy includes the following elements:
  
• | Consistent introduction of new models to our verykool® portfolio to keep it refreshed and attractive to customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintenance of a broad selection of smartphones across various price points in response to the affordability and popularity of smartphones in worldwide markets. In addition, we focus on large-screen phones to fill the elevated consumer appetite for such devices.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expansion of our retail sales channel throughout Latin America, building upon our success in Mexico.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain a strong presence in social media and other selected outlets to promote brand awareness of verykool®.

Technological advances and affordability in smartphones, including the pervasiveness of the open source Android operating system, have driven the global wireless industry. The popularity of smartphones has gained dramatically in developed countries with broader-based consumer purchasing power. However, in certain geographic regions, including Latin America, the market is extremely price sensitive and the current price points of traditional smartphones are beyond the reach of many consumers. With increasing volumes and lower production costs for smartphones, we have expanded our portfolio of affordable smartphones. Although we continue to carry a small number of low-end feature phones, more expensive feature phones have been replaced with entry-level smartphones.
 If the contemplated Merger is consummated, our business and strategy will change materially.  More information on Cooltech’s business, financial condition and strategy is contained in the registration statement on Form S-4 that we filed with the SEC September 19, 2017, as amended.
 Customers
 Our current Latin American customers include carriers, distributors and retailers. We exited the United States market in late 2016, a decision prompted by our lack of penetration in the United States market and the significant cost of defending ourselves against patent lawsuits from domestic non-practicing entities. We sell our products pursuant to customer purchase orders and ship products by common carrier based on customer-specified delivery dates. During 2017, we sold products to approximately 35 customers. Our three largest customers in 2017 represented 21%, 20% and 14% of our net sales, respectively. Our largest customer was a big box retailer, and our second and third largest customers were distributors.
Purchasing and Suppliers
 We have established key relationships with a number of independent design houses and Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”) in China who design and manufacture wireless handsets to our specifications or based upon their own criteria. In 2017, we purchased products from 10 manufacturers, the top three representing 41%, 31% and 12%, respectively, of our cost of sales.
 We purchase products from manufacturers pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Purchase orders are typically filled, based on manufacturing lead times, and shipped to our designated warehouses by common freight carriers. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally good. Any failure or delay by our suppliers in supplying us with products on favorable terms and at competitive prices may severely diminish our ability to obtain and deliver products to our customers on a timely and competitive basis. Although there are a number of such suppliers available to provide or manufacture our products, the establishment of these relationships typically requires a significant investment of time by both parties, and a change in suppliers could cause a delay in or loss of sales and adversely affect our results.
 Sales and Marketing
 We believe that direct selling and one-on-one relationships, as well as in-depth product and competitive landscape knowledge, are important factors in the marketing of the products we sell. Accordingly, in our business-to-business environment, we promote relationship building and maintenance through personal customer contact by our in-country sales and marketing professionals. Additionally, in order to promote our verykool® brand, we advertise in certain of the geographies where we do business in industry publications, both print and online, on billboards and by attending industry trade shows. Further, we participate in co-op advertising sponsored by our customers in other forms of media.
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed or contracted with 9 sales, marketing and merchandizing professionals who are assigned specific geographic territories, most of whom reside in-country. Each salesperson is generally compensated with a base salary or retainer plus a commission or bonus based on sales in his or her territory.

Seasonality
 Our operations may be influenced by a number of seasonal factors in the countries and markets in which we operate. Absent other factors, our business historically has experienced stronger sales during the fourth quarter of the calendar year due to the Christmas holiday season. On the supply side of our business, because all manufacturing of our branded verykool® phones is done in China, the first quarter of the calendar year can be a difficult time during closure of factories for the Chinese New Year. We strive to manage around the closure, but if factories have difficulty starting back up, we could experience delays in getting product and satisfying customer orders, which could have a material adverse effect on our results.
Competition
 The industry and markets where we operate are highly competitive and such competition may increase in the future. We compete for sales of wireless handsets and accessories with well-established large manufacturers, many small brands and independent design houses. Wireless handsets are subject to price competition and price erosion over the lives of the products. We compete on a number of factors, including product design and features, product pricing, product quality, level of services offered, market and product knowledge, customer service, product availability and overall value provided to our customers. Our competitors often possess substantially greater financial, technological, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which could enable them to withstand substantial price competition, launch new products and implement extensive advertising and promotional campaigns. Historically, the barriers to entry into the sourcing and distribution of wireless handsets have been relatively low. Our ability to continue to compete successfully in the wireless handset business is largely dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive and other factors affecting the industry, including new or changing outsourcing requirements, new technology requirements, new and differentiated product introductions, inconsistent or inadequate supply of product, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends, regional and local economic conditions, and discount pricing strategies and promotional activities by competitors.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 35 employees and contractors. Of these employees and contractors, 2 were in executive management positions, 9 were engaged in sales and marketing, 2 were in service operations, 5 were in finance and administration, and 17 were in product management, including development, sourcing, quality control, logistics and field engineering. From time to time, we utilize temporary employees to perform warehouse functions. Our employees and contractors are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees and contractors are good.
