 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 General
 Through SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet, we offer scheduled passenger service with approximately 2,980 daily departures to destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. Substantially all of our flights are operated as Delta Connection, United Express, American Eagle or Alaska Airlines flights under code‑share arrangements (commercial agreements between airlines that, among other things, allow one airline to use another airline’s flight designator codes on its flights) with Delta, United, American or Alaska, respectively. SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet generally provide regional flying to our major airline partners under long‑term, fixed‑fee, code‑share agreements. Under these fixed‑fee agreements, our major airline partners generally pay us fixed rates for operating the aircraft primarily based on the number of completed flights, flight time and the number of aircraft under contract. The major airline partners also reimburse us for specified direct operating expenses (including fuel expense).

 SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet have developed industry‑leading reputations for providing quality regional airline service during their long operating histories. SkyWest Airlines has been flying since 1972 and ExpressJet (and its predecessors) since 1979. As of December 31, 2017, we had 595 aircraft in scheduled service consisting of the following:

 | CRJ200 | CRJ700 | CRJ900 | ERJ135 | ERJ145 | E175 | Total
United | 81 | 20 | — | 3 | 109 | 65 | 278

Other* | 9 | 7 | — | — | 8 | — | 24 
Total Fleet | 208 | 136 | 52 | 3 | 117 | 107 | 623 

  *As of December 31, 2017, these aircraft have been removed from service and are in the process of being returned under the applicable leasing arrangement or are aircraft transitioning between code-share agreements with our major airline partners. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold eleven owned Embraer Brasilia EMB120 (“EMB120”) 30-seat turboprop aircraft at net book value.
    
As of December 31, 2017, our fleet scheduled for service consisted of aircraft manufactured by Bombardier Aerospace (“Bombardier”) and Embraer S.A. (“Embraer”) summarized as follows:

Manufacturer | Aircraft Type | Seat Configuration
Bombardier | CRJ900s | 76 
Bombardier | CRJ700s | 65-70 
Bombardier | CRJ200s | 50 
Embraer | E175s | 76 
Embraer | ERJ145s | 50 
Embraer | ERJ135s | 37 

      Bombardier and Embraer are the primary manufacturers of regional jets operated in the United States and offer many of the amenities of larger commercial jet aircraft, including flight attendant service, a stand‑up cabin, overhead and under seat storage, lavatories and in‑flight snack and beverage service. The speed of Bombardier and Embraer regional jets is comparable to larger aircraft operated by major airlines, and they have a range of approximately 1,600 miles and 2,100 miles, respectively.

 Competition and Economic Conditions
 The airline industry is highly competitive. SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet compete principally with other regional airlines. The combined operations of SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet extend throughout most major geographic markets in the United States. Our competition includes, therefore, nearly every other domestic regional airline. The primary competitors of SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet include Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation (“Air Wisconsin”); Endeavor Air, Inc. (“Endeavor”) (owned by Delta); Envoy Air Inc. (“Envoy”), PSA Airlines, Inc. (“PSA”) and Piedmont Airlines (“Piedmont”) (Envoy, PSA and Piedmont are owned by American); Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (“Horizon”) (owned by Alaska Air Group, Inc.); Mesa Air Group, Inc. (“Mesa”); Republic Airways Holdings Inc. (“Republic”); and Trans States Airlines, Inc. (“Trans States”). Major airlines typically award code-share flying arrangements to regional airlines based primarily upon the following criteria: ability to fly contracted schedules, availability of labor resources, including pilots, low operating cost, financial resources, geographical infrastructure, overall customer service levels relating to on‑time arrival and flight completion percentages and the overall image of the regional airline.
 The principal competitive factors for regional airline code‑share arrangements include labor resources, code‑share agreement terms, reliable flight operations, operating cost structure, ability to finance new aircraft, certification to operate certain aircraft types and geographical infrastructure and markets and routes served. 
  The combined operations of SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet represent the largest regional airline operations in the United States. However, regional carriers owned by major airlines may have access to greater resources through their parent companies than SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet.

Generally, the airline industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. Economic downturns, combined with competitive pressures, have contributed to a number of reorganizations, bankruptcies, liquidations and business combinations among major and regional carriers. The effect of economic downturns may be somewhat mitigated by the predominantly contract-based flying arrangements of SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet. If, however, any of our major airline partners experience a prolonged decline in the number of passengers or are negatively affected by low ticket prices or high fuel prices, they may seek rate reductions in future code-share agreements with SkyWest Airlines or ExpressJet, or materially reduce scheduled flights in order to reduce their costs. In addition, adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to complete scheduled flights and can have a negative impact on our operations and financial condition.     Industry Overview
 Major and Regional Airlines
 The airline industry in the United States has traditionally been comprised of several major airlines, including Alaska, American, Delta and United. The major airlines offer scheduled flights to most major U.S. cities, numerous smaller U.S. cities, and cities throughout the world through a hub and spoke network.
  Regional airlines, including ExpressJet and SkyWest Airlines, typically operate smaller aircraft on shorter distance routes than major and low‑cost carriers. Several regional airlines, including Endeavor, Envoy, Horizon, Piedmont and PSA, are wholly‑owned subsidiaries of major airlines.
 Regional airlines generally do not try to establish an independent route system to compete with the major airlines. Rather, regional airlines typically enter into relationships with one or more major airlines, pursuant to which the regional airline agrees to use its smaller, lower‑cost aircraft to carry passengers booked and ticketed by the major airline between a hub of the major airline and a smaller outlying city. In exchange for such services, the major airline pays the regional airline either a fixed flight fee, termed “contract” or “fixed‑fee” flights, or the regional airline receives a percentage of applicable passenger ticket revenues, termed “prorate” or “revenue‑sharing” flights, as described in more detail below.
 Code‑Share Agreements
 Regional airlines generally enter into code‑share agreements with major airlines, pursuant to which the regional airline is authorized to use the major airline’s two‑letter flight designator codes to identify the regional airline’s flights and fares in the central reservation systems, to paint its aircraft with the colors and/or logos of the major airline and to 

 
  6

 
market and advertise its status as a carrier for the major airline. Code‑share agreements also generally obligate the major airline to provide services such as reservations, ticketing, ground support and gate access to the regional airline, and the major airline often coordinates marketing, advertising and other promotional efforts. In exchange, the regional airline provides a designated number of low‑capacity (usually between 50 and 76 seats) flights between larger airports served by the major airline and surrounding cities, usually in lower‑volume markets. The financial arrangements between the regional airlines and their code‑share partners usually involve either fixed‑fee arrangements or revenue‑sharing arrangements as explained below:

· | Fixed‑Fee Arrangements. Under a fixed‑fee arrangement (referred to as a “fixed‑fee arrangement,” “fixed-fee contract,” “contract flying” or a “capacity purchase agreement”), the major airline generally pays the regional airline a fixed‑fee for each departure, flight hour (measured from takeoff to landing, excluding taxi time) and block hour (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time) incurred, and an amount per aircraft in service each month with additional incentives based on completion of flights, on‑time performance and other operating metrics. In addition, under a fixed fee arrangement, the major airline bears the risk of fuel price fluctuations and certain other costs. Regional airlines benefit from fixed‑fee arrangements because they are protected from some of the elements that cause volatility in airline financial performance, including variations in ticket prices, number of passengers and fuel prices. However, regional airlines in fixed‑fee arrangements generally do not benefit from positive trends in ticket prices, ancillary revenue, such as baggage and food and beverage fees, the number of passengers enplaned or fuel prices, because the major airlines retain passenger fare volatility risk and fuel costs associated with the regional airline flight.

· | Revenue‑Sharing Arrangements. Under a revenue‑sharing arrangement (referred to as a “revenue‑sharing” arrangement or “prorate” arrangement), the major airline and regional airline negotiate a passenger fare proration formula for specifically identified routes, pursuant to which the regional airline receives a percentage of the ticket revenues for those passengers traveling for one portion of their trip on the regional airline and the other portion of their trip on the major airline. On the other hand, the regional airline receives all of the passenger fare when a passenger purchases a ticket on a route solely operated by the regional airline. Substantially all costs associated with the regional airline flight are borne by the regional airline. In a revenue‑sharing arrangement, the regional airline may realize increased profits as ticket prices and passenger loads increase or fuel prices decrease and, correspondingly, the regional airline may realize decreased profits as ticket prices and passenger loads decrease or fuel prices increase.

  SkyWest Airlines has code‑share agreements with United, Delta, American and Alaska. ExpressJet has code‑share agreements with United, Delta and American.
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 87.8% of our passenger revenues related to fixed‑fee contract flights, where Delta, United, American and Alaska controlled scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. The remainder of our passenger revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to prorate flights for Delta, United or American, where we controlled scheduling, pricing and seat inventories, and shared passenger fares with Delta, United or American according to prorate formulas. 
 Under our fixed-fee arrangements, our major airline partners compensate us for our costs of owning or leasing the aircraft on a monthly basis. The aircraft compensation structure varies by agreement, but is intended to cover either our aircraft principal and interest debt service costs, our aircraft depreciation and interest expense or our aircraft lease expense costs while the aircraft is under contract. Under our ExpressJet United Express ERJ Agreement, a portion of the aircraft operating under our SkyWest Airlines Delta Connection Agreement and a portion of our aircraft operating under our ExpressJet Delta Connection Agreement, the major airline partner provides the aircraft to us for a nominal amount. The number of aircraft under our fixed‑fee arrangements and our prorate arrangements as of December 31, 2017 is reflected in the summary below. The following summaries of our code-share agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable agreement.

 In addition to the contractual arrangements described above, SkyWest Airlines has entered into agreements with Alaska and Delta to place additional E175 aircraft (which are typically configured with 76 seats) or E175 SC dual-class regional jet aircraft (which are typically configured with 70 seats) (“E175 SC”) into service for those major airline partners.  As of December 31, 2017, we anticipate placing an additional 12 E175 aircraft with Alaska and 30 E175 SC aircraft with Delta. The delivery dates for the new E175/E175 SC aircraft are expected to take place by the end of 2018 or early 2019.
 SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet Delta Connection Agreements
 ExpressJet and Delta are parties to a Delta Connection Agreement (the “ExpressJet Delta Connection Agreement”). During 2017, ExpressJet and Delta mutually agreed to initiate the wind down of the ExpressJet Delta Connection Agreement by the end of 2018. As of December 31, 2017, ExpressJet operated 33 Canadair CRJ700 regional jet aircraft (“CRJ700”) and 16 Canadair CRJ900 regional jet aircraft (“CRJ900”) under the ExpressJet Delta Connection Agreement. Of the 49 aircraft, ExpressJet anticipates returning the 19 leased aircraft financed by Delta to Delta, including all CRJ900s, and removing 30 CRJ700 aircraft from service with Delta during 2018. ExpressJet is pursuing placement of the 30 CRJ700 aircraft with other major airline partners, of which eight aircraft are scheduled to be placed under an agreement with American following the removal from service with Delta.  ExpressJet expects to transition all 30 CRJ700 aircraft to other major airline partners throughout 2018. 

SkyWest Airlines and Delta are parties to a Delta Connection Agreement (the "SkyWest Airlines Delta Connection Agreement"), pursuant to which SkyWest Airlines provides contract flight services for Delta. The SkyWest Airlines Delta Connection Agreement contains multi‑year rate reset provisions applicable to the CRJ aircraft that became operative in 2010. The SkyWest Airlines Delta Connection Agreement multi-year rate reset provision does not include the E175/E175 SC aircraft. SkyWest Airlines agreed with Delta on contractual rates that are effective through December 31, 2018.  
 The SkyWest Airlines Delta Connection Agreement is subject to early termination in various circumstances, including:

· | if SkyWest Airlines or Delta commits a material breach of the SkyWest Airlines Delta Connection Agreement, subject to 30‑day notice and cure rights;

  Segment Financial Information
 See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, set forth in Item 7 of this Report, and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report, for financial information regarding our business segments. Training and Aircraft Maintenance
 SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet provide substantially all training to their crew members and maintenance personnel at their respective training facilities. SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet employees perform routine airframe and 

 
  11

 
engine maintenance along with periodic inspections of equipment at their respective maintenance facilities. SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet also use third‑party vendors for certain airframe and engine maintenance work.
 Fuel
 Our fixed‑fee agreements with Delta, United, American and Alaska require the respective major airline partner to reimburse us for the fuel costs we incur under those agreements, thereby reducing our exposure to fuel price fluctuations. Under our prorate agreements with Delta, United and American, we are responsible for the costs to operate the flight, including fuel costs, and therefore we are exposed to fuel price fluctuations for flights operated under our prorate agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2017, United and Delta purchased the majority of the fuel for our aircraft flying under their respective fixed-fee agreements directly from their fuel vendors. Historically, we have not experienced problems with the availability of fuel, and believe we will be able to obtain fuel in quantities sufficient to meet our existing and anticipated future requirements at competitive prices. Standard industry fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide protection against fuel price increases, nor do they ensure availability of supply. We typically purchase fuel from third-party suppliers for our prorate agreements. A substantial increase in the price of jet fuel for flights we operate under our prorate agreements, or the lack of adequate fuel supplies in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Employee Matters
 Railway Labor Act
 Our relations with labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act (the “RLA”). Under the RLA, a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the National Mediation Board (the “NMB”) an application alleging a representation dispute, along with authorization cards signed by at least 35% of the employees in that craft or class. The NMB then investigates the dispute and, if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards, conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class. Under the NMB’s usual rules, a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class only if more than 50% of those employees vote for union representation. A certified labor union then enters into negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer.
 Under the RLA, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. Either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may determine, at any time, that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration. If either party rejects binding arbitration, a 30‑day “cooling off” period begins. At the end of this 30‑day period, the parties may engage in “self help,” unless the U.S. President appoints a Presidential Emergency Board (“PEB”) to investigate and report on the dispute. The appointment of a PEB maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days. If the parties do not reach agreement during this period, the parties may then engage in “self help.” “Self help” includes, among other things, a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline. The U.S. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties.
 Collective Bargaining
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 16,300 full‑time equivalent employees. Approximately 22.0% of these employees were represented by unions, as set forth in the table below. Effective December 31, 2011, our subsidiary ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. was merged into our subsidiary Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc., with the surviving corporation named ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. (the “ExpressJet Combination”). Notwithstanding the completion of the ExpressJet Combination, ExpressJet’s employee groups primarily continue to be represented by those unions who provided representation prior to the ExpressJet Combination. Accordingly, the following table refers to ExpressJet’s employee groups based upon their union affiliations prior to the ExpressJet Combination.

      In January 2018, the ExpressJet Delaware Mechanics ratified a one-year contract extension to their labor agreement. Delays or expenses or other challenges associated with executing an acceptable agreement with each labor workgroup with a currently amendable contract could impact our financial performance. 
     As of December 31, 2017, SkyWest and SkyWest Airlines collectively employed 11,965 full‑time equivalent employees, consisting of 4,495 pilots, 3,380 flight attendants, 1,541 customer service personnel, 1,099 mechanics, 825 other maintenance personnel, 166 dispatchers and 459 operational support and administrative personnel. None of these employees are currently represented by a union. Collective bargaining group organization efforts among SkyWest Airlines’ employees do occur from time to time and may continue in the future. If unionization efforts are successful, we may be subjected to risks of work interruption or stoppage and/or incur additional expenses associated with increased union representation of our employees. Neither SkyWest nor SkyWest Airlines has ever experienced a work stoppage due to a strike or other labor dispute, and we consider SkyWest Airlines’ relationships with its employees to be good.
 Government Regulation
 All interstate air carriers, including SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”), the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) and other governmental agencies. Regulations promulgated by the DOT primarily relate to economic aspects of air service. The FAA requires operating, air worthiness and other certificates; approval of personnel who may engage in flight, maintenance or operating activities; record‑keeping procedures in accordance with FAA requirements; and FAA approval of flight training and retraining programs. Generally, governmental agencies enforce their regulations through, among other methods, certifications, which are necessary for the continued operations of SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet, and proceedings, which can result in civil or criminal penalties or revocation of operating authority. The FAA can also issue maintenance directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, grounding of

aircraft, inspection of aircraft, installation of new safety‑related items and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts.
 We believe SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet are in compliance in all material respects with FAA regulations and hold all operating and airworthiness certificates and licenses which are necessary to conduct their respective operations. We incur substantial costs in maintaining current certifications and otherwise complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet are subject. SkyWest Airlines’ and ExpressJet’s flight operations, maintenance programs, record keeping and training programs are conducted under FAA approved procedures. All air carriers operating in the United States are required to comply with federal laws and regulations pertaining to noise abatement and engine emissions. All such air carriers are also subject to certain provisions of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended, because of their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities. SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet are also subject to certain federal and state laws relating to protection of the environment, labor relations and equal employment opportunity. We believe SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations.
 Environmental Matters
 SkyWest, SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection matters. These laws and regulations govern such matters as environmental reporting, storage and disposal of materials and chemicals and aircraft noise. We are, and expect in the future to be, involved in various environmental matters and conditions at, or related to, our properties. We are not currently subject to any environmental cleanup orders or actions imposed by regulatory authorities. We are not aware of any active material environmental investigations related to our assets or properties. Safety and Security
 We are committed to the safety and security of our passengers and employees. SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet have taken many steps, both voluntarily and as mandated by governmental authorities, to increase the safety and security of their operations. Some of the safety and security measures we have taken with our major airline partners include: aircraft security and surveillance, positive bag matching procedures, enhanced passenger and baggage screening and search procedures, and securing of cockpit doors. We are committed to complying with future safety and security requirements. Insurance
 SkyWest, SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet maintain insurance policies we believe are of types customary in the industry and in amounts we believe are adequate to protect against material loss. These policies principally provide coverage for public liability, passenger liability, baggage and cargo liability, property damage, including coverage for loss or damage to our flight equipment, and workers’ compensation insurance.  Seasonality
 Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year, in part because the airline industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations and changes in general economic conditions. Our operations are somewhat favorably affected by pleasure travel on our prorate routes, historically contributing to increased travel in the summer months, and are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from November through January and by inclement weather which can result in cancelled flights, principally during the winter months. Additionally, a significant portion of our fixed‑fee arrangements is based on completing flights and we typically have more scheduled flights during the summer months. We generally experience a significantly higher number of weather cancellations during the winter months, which negatively impacts our revenue during such months.
