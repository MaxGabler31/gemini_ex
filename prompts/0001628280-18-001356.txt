Our Customers
Our revenues are substantially dependent on Boeing and Airbus. The loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, approximately 79% (down from 81% in 2016) and 16% (up from 15% in 2016) of our net revenues were generated from sales to Boeing and Airbus, respectively. We are currently the sole-source supplier for nearly all of the products we sell to Boeing and Airbus. 
Boeing
We are the largest independent supplier of aerostructures to Boeing and manufacture aerostructures for every Boeing commercial aircraft currently in production, including the majority of the airframe content for the Boeing B737, the most popular major commercial aircraft in history, and the Boeing B787, Boeing’s next generation twin aisle composite aircraft. We supply these products through long-term supply agreements that cover the life of these programs, including any commercial derivative models. These supply agreements are described in more detail under “Our Relationship with Boeing” below. We believe our relationship with Boeing will allow us to continue to be an integral partner with Boeing in the designing, engineering, and manufacturing of complex aerostructures.
Airbus
We originally became a supplier to Airbus in April 2006 through the acquisition of BAE Aerostructures (the “BAE Acquisition”) and subsequently, won additional work packages with Airbus. We are one of the largest content suppliers of wing systems for the Airbus A320 family and are a significant supplier for the Airbus A380 and the Airbus A350 XWB. Under our supply agreement with Airbus for the A320, A330, and A340 families, we supply products for the life of the aircraft program. For the A350 XWB and A380 programs, we have long-term requirements contracts with Airbus. We believe we can leverage our relationship with Airbus and our history of delivering high-quality products to further increase our sales to Airbus and continue to partner with Airbus on new programs going forward.
Other Customers
Other customers include Northrop Grumman, Sikorsky, Rolls-Royce, Bombardier, Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation and Bell Helicopter.
U.S. and International Customer Mix
Although most of our revenues are obtained from sales inside the U.S., we generated $1,260.1 million, $1,142.8 million, and $934.9 million in sales to international customers for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, primarily to Airbus. The international revenue is included primarily in the Wing Systems segment. All other segment revenues are primarily from U.S. sales. Approximately 4% of our long-lived assets based on book value are located in the U.K. with approximately another 4% of our long-lived assets located in countries outside the U.S. and the U.K. For financial information by business segment and geographic area see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment and Geographical Information.
Our Relationship with Boeing
A significant portion of Spirit’s operations related to Boeing aerostructures was owned and controlled by Boeing until 2005. On February 7, 2005, Spirit Holdings became a standalone Delaware company, and commenced operations on June 17, 2005 through the acquisition of Boeing’s operations in Wichita, Kansas, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and McAlester, Oklahoma (the “Boeing Acquisition”) by an investor group led by Onex Partners LP and Onex Corporation (together with its affiliates, “Onex”). As of 
6

August 2014, Onex no longer held any investment in the Company. Boeing’s commercial aerostructures manufacturing operations in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, are referred to in this Report as “Boeing Wichita.” 
In connection with the Boeing Acquisition, we entered into long-term supply agreements under which we are Boeing’s exclusive supplier for substantially all of the products and services provided by Boeing Wichita to Boeing prior to the Boeing Acquisition. These supply agreements include products for Boeing’s B737, B747, B767, and B777 commercial aircraft programs, as well as for certain products for Boeing’s B787 program. These supply agreements cover the life of these programs, including any commercial derivative models.
Supply Agreement with Boeing for B737, B747, B767, and B777 Programs ("Sustaining Programs")
Overview. Two documents effectively comprise the Sustaining Programs’ supply contract: (1) the Special Business Provisions (“Sustaining SBP”), which sets forth the specific terms of the Sustaining Programs’ supply arrangement, and (2) the General Terms Agreement (“Sustaining GTA,” and, together with the Sustaining SBP (and any related purchase order or contract, the “Sustaining Agreement”), which sets forth other general contractual provisions, including provisions relating to termination, events of default, assignment, ordering procedures, inspections, and quality controls. The Sustaining Agreement is a requirements contract that covers certain products, including fuselages, struts/pylons, and nacelles (including thrust reversers), wings and wing components, as well as tooling, for the Sustaining Programs for the life of these programs, including any commercial derivative models. During the term of the Sustaining Agreement, and absent default by Spirit, Boeing is obligated to purchase from Spirit all of its requirements for products covered by the Sustaining Agreement. Although Boeing is not required to maintain a minimum production rate, Boeing is subject to a maximum production rate above which it must negotiate with us regarding responsibility for recurring and non-recurring expenditures related to a capacity increase. The Sustaining Agreement is further summarized as follows:
Pricing. The initial pricing terms for recurring products under the Sustaining Agreement expired in May 2013. Under these terms, prices were adjusted each year based on a quantity-based price adjustment formula described in the Sustaining Agreement whereby average per-unit prices are higher at lower volumes and lower at higher volumes.
In April 2014, we entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with Boeing that established pricing terms for Sustaining Programs for the period commencing on April 1, 2014 and ending on December 31, 2015 (this agreement excluded the B737 MAX). The parties were unable to agree upon pricing on the Sustaining Programs for the periods beyond 2015; therefore, an interim payment mechanism was triggered commencing January 1, 2016. This interim payment mechanism was based upon existing prices, adjusted using a quantity-based price adjustment formula and specified annual escalation.
Interim pricing arrangements in effect during 2016 and prior periods were resolved on September 22, 2017, when Boeing and Spirit entered into Amendment No. 30 to the Sustaining SBP (“Sustaining Amendment #30”). Sustaining Amendment #30 generally establishes pricing terms for the Sustaining Program models (excluding the B777x) through December 31, 2022 (with certain limited exceptions). Sustaining Amendment #30 further provides that Boeing and Spirit will negotiate follow-on pricing for periods beyond January 1, 2023 beginning 24 months prior to January 1, 2023. If Boeing and Spirit are unable to reach an agreement with respect to follow-on pricing prior to January 1, 2023, Sustaining Amendment #30 provides a mechanism to establish interim pricing that takes into account escalation and reduces certain rate-based discounts. In addition, Sustaining Amendment #30 provides that the parties will make certain investments for rate increases on the B737 program and implements industry standard payment terms.
Tooling. Boeing owns all tooling used in production or inspection of products covered by the Sustaining Agreement. Spirit is responsible for providing all new tooling required for manufacturing and delivering products under the Sustaining Agreement, and Boeing acquires title to such tooling upon completion of the manufacturing of the tools and payment by Boeing. Although Boeing owns the tooling, Spirit has the limited right to use this tooling without any additional charge to perform its obligations to Boeing under the Sustaining Agreement. Spirit is responsible for maintaining and insuring the tooling. Spirit’s rights to use the tooling are subject to the termination provisions of the Sustaining Agreement.
Changes. Upon written notification to Spirit, Boeing has the right to make changes within the general scope of work performed by Spirit under the Sustaining Agreement. If any such change increases or decreases the cost or time required to perform, Boeing and Spirit must negotiate an equitable adjustment (based on rates, factors, and methodology set forth in the Sustaining Agreement) to the price or schedule to reflect the change, except that Spirit will be responsible for absorbing the cost of certain changes. 
Additional Spirit Costs. In the event that Boeing rejects a product manufactured by Spirit, Boeing is entitled to repair or rework such product, and Spirit is required to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Boeing related thereto. In addition, Spirit is required to reimburse Boeing for costs expended in providing Spirit and/or Spirit’s contractors the technical or manufacturing assistance with respect to Spirit nonperformance issues.
Termination for Convenience. Subject to the restrictions prohibiting Boeing from manufacturing certain products supplied by Spirit or purchasing such products from any other supplier, Boeing may, at any time, terminate all or part of any order under the 
7

Sustaining Agreement by written notice to Spirit. If Boeing terminates all or part of an order, Spirit is entitled to compensation for certain costs.
Termination of Airplane Program. If Boeing decides not to initiate or continue production of a Sustaining Program model or commercial derivative because it determines there is insufficient business basis for proceeding, Boeing may terminate such model or derivative, including any order therefor, by written notice to Spirit. In the event of such a termination, Boeing will be liable to Spirit for any orders issued prior to the date of the termination notice and may also be liable for certain termination costs.
Events of Default and Remedies. It is an “event of default” under the Sustaining Agreement if Spirit:

(1) | fails to deliver products;


(2) | fails to provide certain “assurances of performance”;


(3) | breaches the provisions of the Sustaining Agreement relating to intellectual property and proprietary information;


(4) | participates in the sale, purchase, or manufacture of airplane parts without the required approval of the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) or appropriate foreign regulatory agency;


(5) | fails to maintain the required system of quality assurance;


(6) | fails to comply with other obligations under the Sustaining Agreement (which breach continues for more than 10 days after notice is received from Boeing);


(7) | is unable to pay its debts as they become due, dissolves, or declares bankruptcy; or


(8) | breaches the assignment provisions of the Sustaining Agreement (which breach continues for more than 10 days after notice is received from Boeing).

If an event of default occurs, Boeing has the right to exercise various remedies, including the right to manufacture or to otherwise obtain substitute products, cancel any or all outstanding orders, and/or terminate the Sustaining Agreement. Boeing is limited, however, in its ability to cancel orders or terminate the Sustaining Agreement for the defaults described in items (1), (2) and (6) above. In such cases, Boeing may not cancel orders unless the event of default is material and has an operational or financial impact on Boeing and may not terminate the Sustaining Agreement unless there are repeated, material events of default and certain other criteria are satisfied. Boeing may only terminate the Sustaining Agreement with respect to the aircraft program affected by the event of default. If two or more programs are affected by the event of default, Boeing may terminate the entire Sustaining Agreement. Upon termination, Boeing may also require Spirit to transfer tooling, raw material, work-in-process, and other inventory and certain intellectual property to Boeing in return for reasonable compensation.
Assignment. Spirit may not assign its rights under the Sustaining Agreement other than with Boeing’s consent, which Boeing may not unreasonably withhold unless the assignment is to a disqualified person. A disqualified person is one: (1) whose principal business is as an OEM of commercial aircraft, space vehicles, satellites, or defense systems; (2) that Boeing reasonably believes will not be able to perform its obligations under the Sustaining Agreement; (3) that, after giving effect to the transaction, would be a supplier of more than 40% by value of the major structural components of any Boeing program then in production; or (4) who is, or is an affiliate of, a commercial airplane operator or is one of five named corporate groups. Sale of majority voting power or of all or substantially all of Spirit’s assets to a disqualified person is considered an assignment.
B787 Agreement with Boeing (“B787 Program”) 
Overview. Two documents effectively comprise the B787 Program supply contract: (1) the Special Business Provisions (“787 SBP”), which sets forth the specific terms of the B787 Program’s supply arrangement and (2) the General Terms Agreement (“787 GTA,” and, together with 787 SBP (and any related purchase order or contract), the “B787 Agreement”), which sets forth other general contractual provisions, including provisions relating to termination, events of default, assignment, ordering procedures, inspections, and quality controls. The B787 Agreement is a requirements contract pursuant to which Spirit is Boeing’s exclusive supplier for the forward fuselage, fixed, and moveable leading wing edges, engine pylons, and related tooling for the B787.
Pricing. The B787 Agreement provided pricing for the B787-8 model through 2021, with prices decreasing as cumulative volume levels were met over the life of B787 Program. Initial prices for the B787-9 and B787-10 models were to be determined by a procedure set out in the B787 Agreement and documented by amendment. Spirit and Boeing entered into a memorandum of agreement in November 2014 (the “November 2014 MOA”) that established interim prices for certain B787 shipsets, and the parties agreed to negotiate future rate increases, recurring prices, and other issues across multiple programs during 2015. On September 22, 2017, the parties resolved prior interim pricing, and established go-forward pricing by executing Amendment #25 to the B787 Agreement (the “787 Amendment #25,” and, together with Sustaining Amendment #30, the “Definitive Documentation”). 787 Amendment #25 establishes pricing terms for the B787-8, -9, and -10 models through line unit 1405. 787 Amendment #25 required the Company to repay Boeing $236.0 million less certain adjustments, as a retroactive adjustment for payments that were based on interim pricing. This amount was repaid in October 2017.
8

With respect to future pricing, 787 Amendment #25 provides that the parties will negotiate pricing for B787 line units 1406 and beyond beginning 24 months prior to the scheduled delivery date for line unit 1405. If the currently announced B787 Program production rates do not change, we anticipate that line unit 1405 will be delivered in approximately 2022. 
In the second quarter of 2017, the Company formally extended the then-current contract block ending at line unit 1003 to line unit 1300 and established a planning block from line units 1301 to 1405. Based on cost updates, contract block extension, and planning block addition, the Company updated its estimated contract costs and revenue for the B787 Program. As a result, the Company recorded a second quarter 2017 reach-forward loss of $352.8 on its B787 Program. In the fourth quarter of 2017, favorable cost initiatives and benefits from absorption of fixed costs due to announced rate increases, resulted in a favorable change in estimate on the B787 program of $41.1 million.
Advance Payments. Boeing has made advance payments to Spirit under the B787 Agreement, which are required to be repaid to Boeing by way of offset against the purchase price for future shipset deliveries. Advance repayments were scheduled to be spread evenly over the remainder of the first 1,000 B787 shipsets delivered to Boeing, except that pursuant to an amendment to the B787 Agreement entered into in April 2014, advance repayments were suspended from April 1, 2014 through March 31, 2015, and any repayments that otherwise would have become due during such 12-month period will be made by offset against the purchase price for shipset 1,001 through 1,120. Re-payments resumed in 2015.
 In the event Boeing does not take delivery of a sufficient number of shipsets to repay the full amount of advances prior to the termination of the B787 Program or the B787 Agreement, any advances not then repaid will be applied against any outstanding payments then due by Boeing to us, and any remaining balance will be repaid in annual installments of $42.0 million due on December 15th of each year until the advance payments have been fully recovered by Boeing. Accordingly, portions of the advance repayment liability are included as current and long-term liabilities in our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of advance payments received by us from Boeing not yet repaid was $331.6 million.
Termination of Airplane Program. If Boeing decides not to continue production of the B787 Program because it determines, after consultation with Spirit, that there is an insufficient business basis for proceeding, Boeing may terminate the B787 Program, including any orders, by written notice to Spirit. In the event of such a termination, Boeing will be liable to Spirit for costs incurred in connection with any orders issued prior to the date of the termination notice and may also be liable for certain termination costs and for compensation for any tools, raw materials or work-in-process requested by Boeing in connection with the termination.
Events of Default and Remedies. It is an “event of default” under the B787 Agreement if Spirit:

(1) | fails to deliver products;


(2) | breaches the provisions of the B787 Agreement relating to intellectual property and proprietary information;


(3) | participates in the sale, purchase, or manufacture of airplane parts without the required approval of the FAA or appropriate foreign regulatory agency;


(4) | fails to maintain the required system of quality assurance;


(5) | fails to comply with other obligations under the B787 Agreement (which breach continues for more than 15 days after notice is received from Boeing);


(6) | is unable to pay its debts as they become due, dissolves, or declares bankruptcy;


(7) | fails to comply with U.S. export control laws; or


(8) | breaches the assignment provisions of the B787 Agreement.

If an event of default occurs, Boeing has the right to exercise various remedies set forth in the B787  Agreement, including the right to manufacture or to otherwise obtain substitute products, cancel any or all outstanding orders under the B787 Agreement, and/or terminate the B787 Agreement. Before terminating any order or the B787  Agreement, Boeing is required to work with Spirit to attempt to agree on a satisfactory recovery plan. Boeing may also require Spirit to transfer tooling, raw material, work-in-process and other inventory, and certain intellectual property to Boeing in return for reasonable compensation.
Assignment. Spirit may not assign its rights under the B787 Agreement or any related order other than with Boeing’s consent, which Boeing may not unreasonably withhold unless the assignment is to a disqualified person. The definition of disqualified person under the B787 Agreement is consistent with the definition in the Sustaining Agreement. Sale of majority voting power or of all or substantially all of Spirit’s assets to a disqualified person is considered an assignment.
The foregoing descriptions of Sustaining Agreement, Sustaining Amendment #30, the B787 Agreement, and 787 Amendment #25 do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of each agreement , each of which are filed as referenced in the exhibit list hereto.

License of Intellectual Property
Sustaining Agreement.    All technical work product and works of authorship produced by or for Spirit with respect to any work performed by or for Spirit pursuant to the Sustaining Agreement are the exclusive property of Boeing. All inventions conceived by or for Spirit with respect to any work performed by or for Spirit pursuant to the Sustaining Agreement and any patents claiming such inventions are the exclusive property of Spirit, except that Boeing will own any such inventions that Boeing reasonably believes are applicable to the B787 Program, and Boeing may seek patent protection for such B787 inventions or hold them as trade secrets, provided that, if Boeing does not seek patent protection, Spirit may do so.
Except as Boeing otherwise agrees, Spirit may only use Boeing proprietary information and materials (such as tangible and intangible confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information, and tooling) in the performance of its obligations under the Sustaining Agreement. Spirit is prohibited from selling products manufactured using Boeing proprietary information and materials to any person other than Boeing without Boeing’s authorization.
Spirit has granted to Boeing a license to Spirit proprietary information and materials and software and related products for use in connection with the testing, certification, use, sale, or support of a product covered by the Sustaining Agreement, or the manufacture, testing, certification, use, sale, or support of any aircraft including and/or utilizing a product covered by the Sustaining Agreement. Spirit has also granted to Boeing a license to use Spirit intellectual property to the extent such intellectual property interferes with Boeing’s use of products or intellectual property belonging to Boeing under the Sustaining Agreement.
To protect Boeing against Spirit’s default, Spirit has granted to Boeing a license, exercisable on such default to practice and/or use, and license for others to practice and/or use on Boeing’s behalf, Spirit’s intellectual property and tooling related to the development, production, maintenance, or repair of products in connection with making, using, and selling products. As a part of the foregoing license, Spirit must, at the written request of and at no additional cost to Boeing, promptly deliver to Boeing any such licensed property considered by Boeing to be necessary to exercise Boeing’s rights under the license.
B787 Agreement.    The B787 Agreement establishes three classifications for patented invention and proprietary information: (1) intellectual property developed by Spirit during activity under the B787 Agreement (“Spirit IP”); (2) intellectual property developed jointly by Boeing and Spirit during that activity (“Joint IP”); and (3) all other intellectual property developed during activity under the B787 Agreement (“Boeing IP”).
Boeing may use Spirit IP for work on the B787 Program and Spirit may license it to third parties for work on such program. Spirit may also not unreasonably withhold consent to the license of such intellectual property to third parties for work on other Boeing programs, provided that it may require a reasonable royalty to be paid and, with respect to commercial airplane programs, that Spirit has been offered an opportunity, to the extent commercially feasible, to work on such programs.
Each party is free to use Joint IP in connection with work on the B787 Program and other Boeing programs, but each must obtain the consent of the other to use it for other purposes. If either party wishes to license Joint IP to a third party for work on a Boeing program other than the B787 Program, then the other party may require a reasonable royalty, but may not unreasonably withhold its consent, as long as (if the program in question is another Boeing commercial airplane program) Spirit has been offered an opportunity, to the extent commercially feasible, to perform work for the particular program.
Spirit is entitled to use Boeing IP for the B787 Program, and may require Boeing to license it to subcontractors for the same purpose.
Additional License from Boeing. Boeing has licensed certain intellectual property rights to Spirit under a Hardware Material Services General Terms Agreement (“HMSGTA”), and Supplemental License Agreements (“SLA”) under the HMSGTA. The HMSGTA and SLAs grant Spirit licenses to use Boeing intellectual property to perform MRO of aircraft and aircraft components for customers other than Boeing. These agreements also permit Spirit to use knowledge obtained by Spirit personnel prior to the closing of the Boeing Acquisition. Spirit also may obtain additional SLAs from Boeing and those SLAs will also supersede the restrictions on Spirit’s use of Boeing’s proprietary information and materials described above. Spirit pays Boeing royalties for the use of these licenses.
In February 2016, Spirit’s SLA with Boeing that allowed Spirit to manufacture and sell spare parts to parties other than Boeing using Boeing intellectual property was not renewed. This SLA was not a material component of our business.
Intellectual Property
We have several patents pertaining to our processes and products. While our patents, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, no individual patent or group of patents is of material importance. We also rely on trade secrets, confidentiality agreements, unpatented knowledge, creative products development, and continuing technological advancement to maintain our competitive position.

Competition
Although we are one of the largest independent non-OEM aerostructures suppliers based on annual revenues, with an estimated 20% share of the global non-OEM aerostructures market, this market remains highly competitive and fragmented. Our primary competition currently comes from either work performed by internal divisions of OEMs or other tier-one suppliers, and direct competition continues to grow.
Our principal competitors among OEMs include Boeing, Airbus (including its wholly-owned subsidiaries Stelia Aerospace and Premium Aerotec GmbH), Embraer Brazilian Aviation Co., Leonardo, and United Technologies Corporation. Our principal competitors among non-OEM aerostructures suppliers are Aernnova, Aircelle S.A., Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd., GKN Aerospace, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Inc., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Nordam, Sonaca, Triumph Group, Inc., Latecoere S.A., and Nexcelle. 
Expected Backlog
As of December 31, 2017, our expected backlog associated with large commercial aircraft, business and regional jet, and military equipment deliveries through 2023, calculated based on contractual and historical product prices and expected delivery volumes, was approximately $47.5 billion. This is an increase of $400 million from our corresponding estimate as of the end of 2016. Backlog is calculated based on the number of units Spirit is under contract to produce on our fixed quantity contracts, and Boeing’s and Airbus’ announced backlog on our supply agreements. The number of units may be subject to cancellation or delay by the customer prior to shipment, depending on contract terms. The level of unfilled orders at any given date during the year may be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of firm orders and additional airplane orders, and the speed with which those orders are filled. Accordingly, our expected backlog as of December 31, 2017 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of deliveries or sales for any future period. Approximately 15% of our backlog as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be converted into sales in 2018.
Suppliers and Materials
The principal raw materials used in our manufacturing operations are aluminum, titanium, steel, and carbon fiber. We also purchase metallic parts, non-metallic parts, and machined components. In addition, we procure subassemblies from various manufacturers which are used in the final aerostructure assembly. From time to time, we also review our make versus buy strategy to determine whether it would be beneficial to us to outsource work which we currently produce in-house or vice versa.
We have long-standing relationships with thousands of manufacturing suppliers. Our strategy is to enter into long-term contracts with suppliers to secure competitive pricing. Our exposure to rising costs of raw material is limited to some extent through leveraging relationships with our OEM customers’ high-volume contracts.
We continue to seek and develop sourcing opportunities from North America to Europe and Asia to achieve a competitive global cost structure. Over 25 countries are represented in our international network of suppliers.
Research and Development
We believe that a world-class research and development focus helps maintain our position as an advanced partner to our OEM customers’ new product development teams. As a result, we spend capital and financial resources on our research and development, including $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Through our research, we strive to develop unique intellectual property and technologies that will improve our OEM customers’ products and, at the same time, position us to win work on new products. Our development effort primarily focuses on preparing for the initial production of new products and improving manufacturing processes on our current work. It also serves as an ongoing process that helps develop ways to reduce production costs and streamline manufacturing processes.
Our research and development is geared toward the architectural design of our principal products: fuselage systems, propulsion systems, and wing systems. We are currently focused on research in areas such as advanced metallic joining, low-cost composites, acoustic attenuation, efficient structures, systems integration, advanced design and analysis methods, and new material systems. Other items that are expensed relate to research and development that is not funded by the customer. We collaborate with universities, research facilities and technology partners in our research and development.
Regulatory Matters
Environmental. Our operations and facilities are subject to various environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including federal, state, local, and foreign government requirements, governing, among other matters, the emission, discharge, 
11

handling, and disposal of regulated materials, the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites, and permits required in connection with our operations. We continually monitor our operations and facilities to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations; however, management cannot provide assurance that future changes in such laws or their enforcement, or the nature of our operations will not require us to make significant additional expenditures to ensure continued compliance. Further, we could incur substantial costs, including costs to reduce air emissions, clean-up costs, fines and sanctions, and third-party property damage, or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws, relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air, and groundwater contamination are discovered, and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.
Government Contracts. Companies engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies, either directly or by subcontract, are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally terminate existing contracts, suspend or debar us from receiving new prime contracts or subcontracts, reduce the value of existing contracts, audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs, and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products, among other things. If a contract was terminated for convenience, we could recover the costs we have incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on the work completed prior to termination. However, if the termination is a result of our failure to perform, we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the prime contractor in procuring undelivered items from another source. In addition, failure to follow the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (“NISPOM”) or any other applicable U.S. Government industrial security regulations could, among other things, result in termination of Spirit’s facility clearance level, which in turn would preclude us from being awarded classified contracts or, under certain circumstances, performing on our existing classified contracts.
Commercial Aircraft. The commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the FAA, the European Aviation Safety Agency (“EASA”), and other agencies throughout the world. The military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications. We, and the components we manufacture, are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies, and, in some cases, by individual OEMs, to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models. In addition, the FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components. We believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services.
Export Control. The technical data and components used in the design and production of our products, as well as many of the products and technical data we export, either as individual items or as components incorporated into aircraft, are subject to compliance with U.S. export control laws. Collaborative agreements that we may have with foreign persons, including manufacturers or suppliers, are also subject to U.S. export control laws.
Health and Safety. Our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees. In addition, OSHA provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances. Our management believes that our operations are in material compliance with OSHA’s health and safety requirements.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 15,500 employees: 13,700 located in our four U.S. facilities, 900 located at our U.K. facility, 800 located in our Malaysia facility and 100 in our France facility. 
Our principal U.S. collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions as of December 31, 2017:

Union | Percent of our U.S. Employees Represented | Status of the Agreements with Major Union 
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) | 58% | We have two major agreements - one expires in June 2020 and one expires in December 2024. 
The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) | 19% | We have two major agreements - one expires in December 2018 and one expires in January 2021.
The International Union, Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) | 9% | We have one major agreement expiring in December 2025. 
The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) | 1% | We have one major agreement expiring in September 2020.

Approximately 67% of our U.K. employees are represented by one union, Unite (Amicus Section). In 2013, the Company negotiated two separate ten-year pay agreements with the Manual Staff bargaining and the Monthly Staff bargaining groups of the Unite union. These agreements fundamentally cover basic pay and variable at risk pay, while other employee terms and conditions generally remain the same from year to year until both parties agree to change them. The current pay agreements expire December 31, 2022.
In France, our employees are represented by CFTC (“Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens or French Confederation of Christian Workers”) and FO (“Force Ouvrière or Labor Force”). The Company negotiates yearly on compensation and once every four years on issues related to gender equality and work-life balance. The next election to determine union representation will occur in July 2019.
None of our Malaysia employees are currently represented by a union. 
We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.
