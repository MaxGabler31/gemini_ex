Introduction
Umpqua Holdings Corporation, an Oregon corporation, was formed as a bank holding company in March 1999. At that time, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of South Umpqua Bank, an Oregon state-chartered bank formed in 1953. We became a financial holding company in March 2000 under the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 ("GLB Act"). Umpqua has two principal operating subsidiaries, Umpqua Bank (the "Bank") and Umpqua Investments, Inc. ("Umpqua Investments"). 
We electronically file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy and information statements and other information with the SEC. You may obtain these reports and statements, and any amendments, from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. You may obtain copies of these reports, and any amendments, through our website at www.umpquabank.com. These reports are available through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the SEC.
General Background
Headquartered in Roseburg, Oregon, Umpqua Bank is considered one of the most innovative community banks in the United States, recognized nationally and internationally for its unique company culture and customer experience strategy, which we believe differentiate the Company from its competition. The Bank provides a broad range of banking, wealth management, mortgage and other financial services to corporate, institutional, and individual customers, and also has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Financial Pacific Leasing Inc., a commercial equipment leasing company. 
Umpqua Investments is a registered broker-dealer and registered investment advisor with offices in Oregon, Washington, and California, and also offers products and services through Umpqua Bank stores. The firm is one of the oldest investment companies in the Northwest. Umpqua Investments offers a full range of investment products and services including: stocks, fixed income securities (municipal, corporate, and government bonds, CDs, and money market instruments), mutual funds, annuities, options, retirement planning, advisory account services, goals-based planning and insurance.
Along with its subsidiaries, the Company is subject to the regulations of state and federal agencies and undergoes regular examinations by these regulatory agencies. 
Business Strategy
Umpqua Bank's primary objective is to become the leading community-oriented financial services organization throughout the Western United States. We intend to increase market share, grow our assets and increase profitability and shareholder value by differentiating ourselves from competitors through the following strategies:
Use Human Digital Banking Approach to Retain and Expand Customer Base. As consumer preferences evolve with technological changes, our strategy remains consistent: deliver an extraordinary experience across all customer touchpoints. As a result, we've developed our Human Digital banking approach, which uses technology to empower deeper, even more meaningful relationships with our customers. We believe this differentiates Umpqua and positions the Company well to adapt quickly as customer use of physical and digital channels evolves. We believe that by introducing this combination of personal and digital banking services through platforms like Umpqua Go-To, we're enhancing our ability to attract a broader range of customers and expand our value proposition across all channels.

Capitalize on Innovative Product Delivery System. Our philosophy has been to create a unique delivery model that transforms banking from a chore into an experience that's both relevant to customers and highly differentiated from other financial institutions. With this approach in mind, we maintain a bank store concept designed to reflect customer and community preferences and drive revenue growth by making the Bank's products and services more tangible and accessible.
Deliver on Strategic Initiative. The Company's 3-year (2018 - 2020) strategic initiative, "Umpqua Next Gen," is designed to modernize the company, diversify and increase revenue, and streamline expenses.  Umpqua Next Gen builds on the customer-centric approach to banking, allowing us to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and create a competitive advantage. This strategy is called Human Digital banking, an approach that helps the Company transform into an organization that uses technology, data and analytics to empower our associates to build deeper, more valuable, and more profitable customer relationships. During 2018, we launched our Go-To application, which puts customers in touch with their accounts as well as with their own financial advisor.
Focus on Customer Experience. At every level of the Company, from the Board of Directors to our newest associates, and across all customer service delivery channels, we are focused on delivering an extraordinary customer experience. It is an integral part of our culture, and we believe we are among the first banks to introduce a measurable quality service program. Under our Return on Quality or ROQ program, the performance of each sales associate and store is evaluated based on specific measurable factors, including reports by incognito "mystery shoppers" and customer surveys. Based on scores achieved, Umpqua's ROQ program rewards both individual sales associates and store teams with financial incentives. Through such programs, we are able to measure the quality of the experience provided to our customers and maintain employee focus on quality customer service.
Establish Strong Brand Awareness. As a financial services provider, we devote considerable resources to developing the "Umpqua Bank" brand. This is done through design strategy, marketing, merchandising, and delivery through our customer-facing channels, as well as through active public relations, social media and community-based events and initiatives. From Bank-branded bags of custom roasted coffee beans to educational seminars, in-store events and social giving campaigns, Umpqua's goal is to connect with our customers and communities in fresh and engaging ways. The unique look and feel of our stores and interactive displays help demonstrate our commitment to being an innovative, customer-friendly provider of financial products and services, and our active community engagement and investments stand out with commercial customers. Our brand activation approach is based on actions, not just advertising, and builds strong consumer awareness of our products and services.
Prudently Manage Capital. An important part of our strategy is to continue to manage capital prudently, and to employ excess capital in a thoughtful and opportunistic manner that improves shareholder returns and minimizes risk to capital. We accomplish this through organic growth, dividends, and nominal share repurchases. We also opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions, which could include technology-driven enterprises or banks and financial services companies in markets where we see growth potential. 
Marketing and Sales
Our goal of increasing our share of financial services in our market areas is driven by a technology, marketing, communications and sales strategy with the following key components:
Integrated Marketing and Communications. Our comprehensive marketing and communications strategy aims to strengthen the Umpqua Bank brand and generate public awareness through innovative marketing initiatives that stand out in our markets and our industry. The Bank has been recognized nationally for its use of new media and unique approach. From the Bank's Local Spotlight program, ice cream trucks and social giving platform, to interactive community activation initiatives, Umpqua is leveraging both traditional and emerging media channels in new ways to advance the brand and create meaningful connections with consumers. 
Retail Store Concept. The physical environment continues to play a critical role both in creating awareness of our brand and franchise, as well as in successfully providing the right products and services to our customers. Using a more retailer-oriented approach, we encourage existing and potential customers to come in to our physical locations. To that end, we design our physical locations to display financial services and products in ways that are highly tactile and engaging. Unlike many financial institutions, we encourage all in our communities to visit our stores, where they are greeted by well-trained associates and encouraged to browse our products and services. Our "Next Gen" store model includes features like free wireless, free use of laptop computers, open rooms with refrigerated beverages and innovative product packaging. 
5

Growth Culture. We believe strongly that by investing in the growth of our associates, customers and communities, we will create more opportunity to provide our products and services and to create deeper customer relationships across all divisions, from retail to mortgage and wholesale. Although a successful marketing program will attract customers to visit, well-trained associates are critical to solving customer needs with the right products and services. Umpqua's culture has become well established throughout the organization due to a clear focus and ongoing training of our associates on all aspects of sales and service. We provide training through our in-house training to recognize and celebrate associates who demonstrate an exceptional commitment to our customers and deliver smart financial solutions our customers value. This service culture has become iconic in our industry, and is a key element in our ability to attract both talented associates and loyal customers. 
Products and Services
We offer an array of traditional and digital financial products to meet the banking needs of our market area and target customers. To ensure the ongoing viability of our product offerings, we regularly examine the desirability and profitability of existing and potential new products. Other avenues through which customers can access our products include our Go-To app and redesigned web site.
Deposit Products. We offer deposit products, including non-interest bearing checking accounts, interest bearing checking and savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Interest-bearing accounts earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management's desire to increase certain types or maturities of deposit liabilities. Our approach is to provide a streamlined customer experience that meets the customer's needs across all channels. This approach is designed to add value for the customer, increase products per household and generate related fee income. 
Private Bank. Umpqua Private Bank serves high net worth individuals and nonprofits, providing investment services. The private bank is designed to augment Umpqua's existing high-touch customer experience, and works collaboratively with the Bank's affiliate Umpqua Investments to offer a comprehensive, integrated approach that meets clients' financial goals, including financial planning, trust services, and investments. 
Wealth Management. In its combined role as a broker/dealer and a registered investment advisor, Umpqua Investments may provide comprehensive financial planning advice to its clients as well as investment services. This advice can include cash management, risk management (insurance planning/sales), investment planning (including investment advice and/or portfolio checkups), retirement planning (for employees and employers), or estate planning. The broker/dealer side of Umpqua Investments offers a full range of brokerage services including equity and fixed income products, mutual funds, annuities, options and life insurance products. At December 31, 2018, Umpqua Investments had 57 Series 7-licensed financial advisors serving clients at stand-alone retail brokerage offices, as well as "Investment Opportunity Centers" located in select Bank stores. 
Commercial Loans and Leases and Commercial Real Estate Loans. We offer specialized loans for corporate and commercial customers, including accounts receivable and inventory financing, multifamily loans, equipment loans, commercial equipment leases, international trade, real estate construction loans and permanent financing and Small Business Administration ("SBA") program financing as well as capital markets and treasury management services. Additionally, we offer specially designed loan products for small businesses through our Small Business Division, and have a business banking division to increase lending to small and mid-sized businesses. Ongoing credit management activities continue to focus on commercial real estate loans given this is a significant portion of our loan portfolio. We are also engaged in initiatives that continue to diversify the loan portfolio including a strong focus on commercial and industrial loans in addition to financing owner-occupied properties.
Residential Real Estate Loans. Real estate loans are available for the construction, purchase, and refinancing of residential owner-occupied and rental properties. Borrowers can choose from a variety of fixed and adjustable rate options and terms. We sell most residential real estate loans that we originate into the secondary market. Servicing is retained on the majority of these loans. We also support the Home Affordable Refinance Program and Home Affordable Modification Program.
Consumer Loans. We provide loans to individual borrowers for a variety of purposes, including secured and unsecured personal loans, home equity and personal lines of credit and motor vehicle loans.

Market Area and Competition
The geographic markets we serve are highly competitive for deposits, loans, leases and retail brokerage services. We compete with traditional banking institutions, as well as non-bank financial service providers, such as credit unions, brokerage firms and mortgage companies. In our primary market areas of Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, and Nevada, major national banks generally hold dominant market share positions. By virtue of their larger capital bases, these institutions have significantly larger lending limits than we do, generally have more expansive branch networks, and can invest in technology on a larger scale than we can. Competition also includes other commercial banks that are community-focused. 
As the industry becomes increasingly oriented toward technology-driven delivery systems, permitting transactions to be conducted on mobile devices and computers, non-bank institutions are able to attract funds and provide lending and other financial services even without offices located in our primary service area. Some insurance companies and brokerage firms compete for deposits by offering rates that are higher than may be appropriate for the Bank in relation to its asset and liability management objectives. However, we offer a wide array of deposit products and believe we can compete effectively through rate-driven product promotions. We also compete with full service investment firms for non-bank financial products and services offered by Umpqua Investments. 
Credit unions present a significant competitive challenge for our banking services and products. As credit unions currently enjoy an exemption from income tax, they are able to offer higher deposit rates and lower loan rates than banks can on a comparable basis. Credit unions are also not currently subject to certain regulatory constraints, such as the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"), which, among other things, requires us to implement procedures to make and monitor loans throughout the communities we serve. Adhering to such regulatory requirements raises the costs associated with our lending activities, and reduces potential operating profits. Accordingly, we seek to compete by focusing on building customer relationships, providing superior service and offering a wide variety of commercial banking products, such as commercial real estate loans, inventory and accounts receivable financing, and SBA program loans for qualified businesses.

Lending and Credit Functions
The Bank makes both secured and unsecured loans to individuals and businesses. At December 31, 2018, commercial real estate, commercial, residential, and consumer and other represented approximately 50.4%, 23.1%, 23.6%, and 2.9%, respectively, of the total loan and lease portfolio. 
Inter-agency guidelines adopted by federal bank regulators mandate that financial institutions establish real estate lending policies with maximum allowable real estate loan-to-value limits, subject to an allowable amount of non-conforming loans as a percentage of capital. We have adopted as loan policy loan-to-value limits that range from 5% to 10% less than the federal guidelines for each category; however, policy exceptions are permitted for real estate loan customers with strong financial credentials.

Loans and Leases 
We manage asset quality and control credit risk through diversification of the loan and lease portfolio and the application of policies designed to promote sound underwriting and loan and lease monitoring practices. The Bank's Credit Quality Group is charged with monitoring asset quality, establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the Bank. The provision for loan and lease losses charged to earnings is based upon management's judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb probable incurred losses. The amount of provision charged is dependent upon many factors, including loan and lease growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan and lease portfolio, delinquencies, management's assessment of loan and lease portfolio quality, general economic conditions that can impact the value of collateral, and other trends. The evaluation of these factors is performed through an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Reviews of non-performing, past due loans and leases and larger credits, designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses, and to determine the adequacy of the allowance, are conducted on a quarterly basis. These reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers, the value of the applicable collateral, loan and lease loss experience, estimated loan and lease losses, growth in the loan and lease portfolio, prevailing economic conditions and other factors. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 3,928 full-time equivalent employees. None of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and management believes its relations with employees to be good. Information regarding employment agreements with our executive officers is contained in Item 11 below, which item is incorporated by reference to our proxy statement for the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders.
Government Policies
The operations of our subsidiaries are affected by state and federal legislative and regulatory changes and by policies of various regulatory authorities, including, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve"), United States fiscal policy, and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies. 
Supervision and Regulation
General. We are extensively regulated under federal and state law. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not shareholders. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation. Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation or regulation may have in the future. Umpqua is subject to the disclosure and other requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and rules promulgated thereunder and administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a listed company on NASDAQ, Umpqua is subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies.
The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted non-capital safety and soundness standards for financial institutions. These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. 
Holding Company Regulation. We are a registered financial holding company under the GLB Act, and are subject to the supervision of, and regulation by the Federal Reserve. As a financial holding company, we are examined by and file reports with the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank.
Financial holding companies are bank holding companies that satisfy certain criteria and are permitted to engage in activities that traditional bank holding companies are not. The qualifications and permitted activities of financial holdings companies are described below under "Regulatory Structure of the Financial Services Industry."

Federal and State Bank Regulation. Umpqua Bank, as a state chartered bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, is primarily subject to the supervision and regulation of the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services Division of Financial Regulation ("DCBS"), the Washington Department of Financial Institutions ("DFI"), the California Department of Business Oversight ("DBO"), the Idaho Department of Finance Banking Section, the Nevada Division of Financial Institutions, the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"). These agencies may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. Our primary state regulator, DCBS, regularly examines the Bank or participates in joint examinations with the FDIC. 
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. Umpqua Bank has a responsibility under the CRA, as implemented by FDIC regulations, to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. In connection with its examination, the FDIC assesses Umpqua Bank's record of compliance with the CRA. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility. Umpqua Bank's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of Umpqua potentially resulting in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved. Umpqua Bank's failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions against it by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies, including the CFPB and the Department of Justice.  As of the most recent CRA examination, the Bank's CRA rating was "Satisfactory". 
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interest of such persons. Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions. 
The Federal Reserve Act and related Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of Umpqua or its subsidiaries. Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies. Umpqua and its subsidiaries have adopted an Affiliate Transactions Policy and have entered into various affiliate agreements in compliance with Regulation W.
Financial Privacy. Federal law and certain state laws currently contain client privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to affiliated companies and non-affiliated third parties. These rules require disclosure of privacy policies to clients and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of opt out or opt in authorizations. Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain state laws, companies are required to notify clients of security breaches resulting in unauthorized access to their personal information. In connection with the regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial information, the federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information. 
Federal Deposit Insurance. Substantially all deposits with Umpqua Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The standard maximum federal deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per qualified account.

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines that the institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation or order or any condition imposed in writing by, or pursuant to, any written agreement with the FDIC. The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Dividends. Under the Oregon Bank Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"), the Bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of cash dividends to its parent company. A bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment would reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements. In addition, under the Oregon Bank Act, the amount of the dividend paid by the Bank may not be greater than net unreserved retained earnings, after first deducting to the extent not already charged against earnings or reflected in a reserve, all bad debts, which are debts on which interest is unpaid and past due at least six months unless the debt is fully secured and in the process of collection; all other assets charged-off as required by Oregon bank regulators or a state or federal examiner; and all accrued expenses, interest and taxes of the Bank. In addition, state and federal regulatory authorities are authorized to prohibit banks and holding companies from paying dividends that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve's view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. 
Capital Adequacy. The federal and state bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in their examination and regulation of holding companies and banks. If capital falls below the minimum levels established by these guidelines, a holding company or a bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open new facilities. 
The FDIC and Federal Reserve have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for holding companies and banks. The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among holding companies and banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weightings. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. The capital adequacy guidelines limit the degree to which a holding company or bank may leverage its equity capital. 
On July 2, 2013, federal banking regulators approved final rules that revised the regulatory capital rules to incorporate certain revisions by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to the Basel capital framework ("Basel III"). The phase-in period for the final rules began for the Company on January 1, 2015, originally full compliance with the final rules' requirements was to be phased in on January 1, 2019. On November 21, 2017, the federal banking regulators finalized a halt in the phase-in of certain provisions of the rule for certain banks including Umpqua. 
The final rules, among other things, include a new common equity Tier 1 capital ("CET1") to risk-weighted assets ratio, including a capital conservation buffer. The required CET1 ratio was to gradually increase from 4.5% on January 1, 2015 to 7.0% on January 1, 2019. The final rules would also have raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 6.0%, the minimum as of December 31, 2018, to 8.5% on January 1, 2019, as well as require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. Under the final rules, as Umpqua grew above $15.0 billion in assets as a result of an acquisition, the combined trust preferred security debt issuances were phased out of Tier 1 and into Tier 2 capital.
The final rules had provided for a number of adjustments to and deductions from the new CET1. Deductions included, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets not dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Effective on January 1, 2018, the full transition to the Basel III treatment has been halted.
Under Basel III, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, the Company and the Bank, have made a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Company's securities portfolio.

FDICIA requires federal banking regulators to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to a capital-deficient institution, including requiring a capital restoration plan and restricting certain growth activities of the institution. Umpqua could be required to guarantee any such capital restoration plan required of the Bank if the Bank became undercapitalized. Pursuant to FDICIA, regulations were adopted defining five capital levels: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, severely undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the regulations, the Bank is considered "well capitalized" as of December 31, 2018. 
Federal and State Regulation of Broker-Dealers. Umpqua Investments is regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), as well as the SEC, and has customer funds, excluding decline in value of securities, insured through the Securities Investors Protection Corporation ("SIPC") as well as third party insurers.  FINRA and the SEC perform regular examinations of Umpqua Investments that include reviews of policies, procedures, recordkeeping, trade practices, and customer protection as well as other inquiries.
Effects of Government Monetary Policy. Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the Federal Reserve, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits. These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty. 
Regulation of the Financial Services Industry. Federal laws and regulations governing banking and financial services underwent significant changes in recent years and we believe will continue to undergo significant changes in the future. From time to time, legislation is introduced in the United States Congress that contains proposals for altering the structure, regulation, and competitive relationships of the nation's financial institutions. If enacted into law, these proposals could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, and other financial institutions. Whether or in what form any such legislation may be adopted or the extent to which our business might be affected thereby cannot be predicted. 
The GLB Act, enacted in November 1999, repealed sections of the Banking Act of 1933, commonly referred to as the Glass-Steagall Act, that prohibited banks from engaging in securities activities, and prohibited securities firms from engaging in banking. The GLB Act created a new form of holding company, known as a financial holding company, that is permitted to acquire subsidiaries that are engaged in banking, securities underwriting and dealing, and insurance underwriting. 
To qualify as a financial holding company, the bank holding company must be deemed to be well-capitalized and well-managed, as those terms are used by the Federal Reserve. In addition, each subsidiary bank of a bank holding company must also be well-capitalized and well-managed and be rated at least "satisfactory" under the CRA. A bank holding company that does not qualify, or has not chosen, to become a financial holding company must limit its activities to traditional banking activities and those non-banking activities the Federal Reserve has deemed to be permissible because they are closely related to the business of banking. 
The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ("Riegle-Neal Act") permits interstate banking and branching, which allows banks to expand nationwide through acquisition, consolidation or merger. Under this law, an adequately capitalized bank holding company may acquire banks in any state or merge banks across state lines if permitted by state law. Further, banks may establish and operate branches in any state subject to the restrictions of applicable state law. Under Oregon law, an out-of-state bank or bank holding company may merge with or acquire an Oregon state chartered bank or bank holding company upon receipt of approval from the Director of the DCBS. The Bank now has the ability to open additional de novo branches in the states of Oregon, California, Washington, Idaho, and Nevada. 
Section 613 of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated interstate branching restrictions that were implemented as part of the Riegle-Neal Act, and removed many restrictions on de novo interstate branching by national and state-chartered banks. The FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency now have authority to approve applications by insured state nonmember banks and national banks, respectively, to establish de novo branches in states other than the bank's home state if "the law of the State in which the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch, if the bank were a State bank chartered by such State." The enactment of this Section 613 may significantly increase interstate banking by community banks in western states, where barriers to entry were previously high.

Anti-Terrorism Legislation. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act ("USA Patriot Act") prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks, as well as imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening and holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals. Banks are also required to have effective compliance processes in place relating to anti-money laundering ("AML") compliance, as well as compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses public company corporate governance, auditing, accounting, executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed, which was a sweeping overhaul of financial industry regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council and permanently raised the FDIC deposit insurance coverage to $250,000. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act added additional requirements on Bank and their regulators, including additional interchange fee limits, mortgage limit requirements, and say-on-pay executive compensation requirements.
Stress Testing and Capital Planning. Umpqua was subject to the annual Dodd-Frank Act capital stress testing ("DFAST") requirements of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.  As part of the DFAST process, Umpqua was required to submit the results of the company-run stress tests to the FDIC, and Umpqua disclosed certain results from stress testing exercises.  However, in May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, modified provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that impacted Umpqua, which includes raising the total asset threshold from $10 billion to $250 billion at which bank holding companies are required to conduct annual company-run stress tests. Although the Corporation will continue to monitor and stress test its capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators, the Company will no longer conduct company run DFAST capital stress-testing as a result of the legislative amendments.
CFPB Regulation and Supervision. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to examine Umpqua and Umpqua Bank for compliance with a broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations that relate to credit card, deposit, mortgage and other consumer financial products and services the Bank offers. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB broad authority to take corrective action against Umpqua and Umpqua Bank as it deems appropriate. The CFPB is authorized to issue regulations and take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The agency also has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. 
In addition, the CFPB's regulations require lenders to conduct a reasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation of a residential mortgage loan that the borrower will have a reasonable ability to repay the loan. The regulations also define criteria for making Qualified Mortgages which entitle the lender and any assignee to either a conclusive or rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability to repay rule. The mortgage servicing rules include new standards for notices to consumers, loss mitigation procedures, and consumer requests for information. 
Joint Agency Guidance on Incentive Compensation. Federal banking regulators joint agency guidance applies to executive and non-executive incentive compensation plans administered by banks. The guidance says that incentive compensation programs must:

• | Provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward.


• | Be compatible with effective controls and risk- management; and


• | Be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the board;

The Federal Reserve reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of the Company and other banking organizations. The findings of the supervisory initiatives are included in reports of examination and any deficiencies will be incorporated into the Company's supervisory ratings, which can affect the Company's ability to make acquisitions and take other actions.
