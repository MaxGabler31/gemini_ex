Item 1.  Business
Business Overview
 One of the original off-price retailers, Tuesday Morning is a leading destination for unique home and lifestyle goods. We were established in 1974 and specialize in name-brand, better/best products for the home. We are known for irresistible finds at an incredible value and search the world for amazing deals to bring to our customers.
 We are a closeout retailer, selling high-quality products at prices generally below those found in boutique, specialty and department stores, catalogs and on-line retailers. Our customers come to us for an ever-changing, exceptional assortment of brand names at great prices. Our primary merchandise categories are upscale home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, gourmet food, toys and seasonal décor. Key vendors are Peacock Alley, Sferra, Lenox, Cuisinart, Home Environment, and Charisma. We buy our inventory opportunistically from a variety of sources including direct from manufacturer, through closeout sellers and occasionally other retailers. We have strong supplier relationships and we strive to make it easy for our vendors to do business with us, so that they will come to us first. Our goods are deeply-discounted, but never seconds or irregulars.
 Our customer is a savvy shopper with a discerning taste for quality at a value. Our strong value proposition has established a loyal customer base, who we engage regularly with social media, email, direct mail, digital media and newspaper circulars. 
 With over 715 stores across the country, we are in the neighborhood in convenient, accessible locations. Our store layout is clean and simple, and the low-frills environment means we can pass even deeper savings on to our dedicated customer base. Our stores operate in both primary and secondary locations of major suburban markets, near our middle and upper‑income customers. We are generally able to obtain favorable lease terms due to our flexibility regarding site selection and our straightforward format, allowing us to use a wide variety of space configurations.
 We operate our business as a single operating segment. 
 Business Strategy
 Several years ago, we began a transformation of our Company in order to regain our position as a leader in off‑price retail. We executed on a number of critical steps under our business turnaround strategy. These steps included exiting certain categories, refreshing and reorganizing stores, reducing the level of clearance merchandise, modifying company policies, and eliminating assets that were no longer needed. During this phase, we took specific steps to improve our inventory management process, sourcing of inventory, merchandise offerings and sales productivity.
 Since fiscal year 2014, when we moved into our rebuilding phase, we have been focusing on supply chain efficiency, working capital management and inventory turns, repositioning our real estate portfolio, implementing a new marketing strategy, and continuing to improve our merchandise assortment, cost controls and infrastructure.
 As a key component of this rebuilding phase, we are focused on improving store locations and the in-store experience for our customers. In this regard, we are closing less productive stores with limited foot traffic and relocating some of these stores to, or opening new stores in, better locations with footprints that are on average three to five thousand square feet larger. In some cases, we are also expanding existing stores to this larger footprint. In addition, we are improving the finishes in these relocated, new and expanded stores, such as polished concrete floors, simple but attractive fixture packages and new lighting and color palettes, in an effort to match the in-store experience for our customers with the quality of our products.
 Competition & Seasonality
 We believe the principal factors by which we compete are brand names, price, breadth and quality of our product offerings. Our prices are generally below those of department and specialty stores, catalog and on‑line retailers and we offer a broad assortment of high‑end, first quality, brand-name merchandise. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including department, discount and specialty stores, e‑commerce and catalog retailers and mass merchants, which sell, among other products, home furnishings, housewares and related products. We also compete in particular markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of home furnishing and houseware products that we sell. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources that may, among other things, increase their ability to purchase inventory at lower costs or to initiate and sustain aggressive price competition.
 Our business is subject to seasonality, with a higher level of our net sales and operating income generated during the quarter ending December 31, which includes the holiday shopping season. Net sales in the quarters ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 accounted for approximately 33%, 34% and 33% of our annual net sales for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Working Capital Items
 Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December. The increase in working capital needs during this time is typically financed with cash flow provided by operations and our revolving credit facility. Additional details are provided in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 Inventory is the largest asset on our balance sheet. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet our customers’ demands while keeping the inventory fresh and turning the inventory appropriately to optimize profitability.
 Purchasing
 We provide an outlet for manufacturers and other sources looking for effective ways to reduce excess inventory resulting from order cancellations by retailers, manufacturing overruns, bankruptcies and excess capacity. Since our inception, we have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining first quality, brand-name off‑price merchandise in adequate volumes and at competitive prices. We utilize a mix of both domestic and international suppliers. We pay our suppliers timely and generally do not request special consideration for markdowns, advertising or returns. During fiscal 2018, our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 12% of total purchases, with no single vendor accounting for more than 3% of total purchases.
Low Cost Operations
 It is our goal to operate with a low cost structure in comparison to many other retailers. We place great emphasis on expense management throughout the Company. Our stores have a “no frills” format and we are flexible in our site selection in order to maintain favorable lease terms.
Customer Shopping Experience
 While we offer a “no frills” format in our stores, we have made progress in reorganizing and refreshing our stores to enhance our customers’ shopping experience. We offer a flexible return policy and we accept all major payment methods including cash, checks, all major credit cards, and digital wallets. We continue to work on initiatives we believe will enhance our customers’ shopping experience.
Distribution
 We utilize 1.2 million square feet of distribution center facilities in Dallas, Texas and a 0.6 million square foot distribution center in Phoenix, Arizona which service all of our stores throughout the United States. The Phoenix distribution center commenced operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We shipped approximately 120 million units to our stores during fiscal 2018. 
Pricing
 Our pricing policy is to sell merchandise generally below retail prices charged by department and specialty stores, catalog and on‑line retailers. Prices are determined centrally and are initially uniform at all of our stores. Once a price is determined for a particular item, labels displaying two‑tiered pricing are affixed to the product. A typical price tag displays a “Compare At” or “Compare Estimated Value” price, and “Our Price”. Our buyers determine and verify retail “Compare At” or “Compare Estimated Value” prices by reviewing prices published in advertisements, catalogs, on‑line and manufacturers’ suggested retail price lists and by visiting department or specialty stores selling similar merchandise. Our information systems provide daily sales and inventory information, which enables us to evaluate our prices and inventory levels and to adjust prices on unsold merchandise in a timely manner and on a periodic basis as dictated by sales volumes and incoming purchases, thereby effectively managing our inventory levels and offering competitive pricing.
Employees
 As of June 30, 2018, we employed 1,770 persons on a full‑time basis and 7,292 persons on a part‑time basis. Our employees are not represented by any labor unions. We have not experienced any work stoppage due to labor disagreements, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.

Site Selection.  We continually evaluate our current store base for potential enhancement or relocation of our store locations. As a result of this ongoing evaluation, we intend to pursue attractive relocation opportunities in our existing store base, close certain stores by allowing leases to expire for underperforming stores or where alternative locations in similar trade areas are not available at acceptable lease rates, and, when appropriate, open new stores. For both new stores and relocations, we negotiate for upgraded sites. We believe that this strategy will better position us for long‑term profitable growth. We expect to upgrade both the appearance and operation of our new and relocated stores compared to our existing stores and do not anticipate difficulty in locating additional store locations in areas with our target customer demographics.

Store Leases.  Except for one store adjacent to our existing distribution center in Dallas, Texas, we lease our store locations under operating leases that typically include renewal options. Some of our leases also provide for contingent rent based upon store sales exceeding stipulated amounts.
 Our store leases typically include “kick clauses,” which allow us, at our option, to exit the lease with no penalty 24 to 60 months after entering into the lease if store sales do not reach a stipulated amount stated in the lease. These kick clauses provide us with flexibility in opening new stores and relocating existing stores by allowing us to quickly and cost‑effectively vacate a site that does not meet our sales expectations. As a result, we generally do not operate locations with continued store‑level operating losses.
 Store Layout.  Our site selection process and “no frills” approach to presenting merchandise allow us to use a wide variety of space configurations. The size of our stores ranges from approximately 5,600 to 30,000 square feet, averaging on a per store basis approximately 12,100 square feet as of June 30, 2018.  Historically, we have designed our stores to be functional, with less emphasis placed upon fixtures and leasehold aesthetics. With our current real estate strategy, we continue to be focused on designing a very functional, easy to shop environment that also highlights the quality of the merchandise.  We display all merchandise on counters, shelves, or racks while maintaining minimum inventory in our stockrooms.
 Store Operations.  Our stores are generally open seven days a week, excluding certain holidays. We continue to maintain the frequency of shipments of merchandise which results in improved efficiency of receiving and restocking activities at our stores. We attempt to align our part‑time employees’ labor hours with anticipated workload and with current customer sales. We conduct annual physical counts of our store merchandise staggered throughout the second half of our fiscal year, primarily when stores are closed.
 Store Management.  Each store has a manager who is responsible for recruiting, training and supervising store personnel and assuring that the store is managed in accordance with our established guidelines and procedures. Store managers are full‑time employees. Our store managers are supported by district and regional level support. Store managers are responsible for centrally-directed store disciplines and routines. The store manager is assisted primarily by part‑time employees who generally serve as assistant managers and cashiers, and help with merchandise stocking efforts. Members of our management visit selected stores routinely to review inventory levels and merchandise presentation, personnel performance, expense controls, security and adherence to our policies and procedures. In addition, district and regional field managers periodically meet with senior management to review store policies and discuss purchasing, merchandising, advertising and other operational issues.
