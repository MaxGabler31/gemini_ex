Item 1. Business
Introduction
We are an agri-food innovator that combines data science and machine learning with biology and genetics to unlock nature’s genetic diversity with our CropOS® food innovation engine. Our purpose is to catalyze and broadly empower innovation from plant to plate so great tasting, more nutritious, affordable, and sustainable food choices are available to everyone. We combine cutting-edge technology with an innovative business approach to bring product innovations to customers and consumers. Our CropOS® technology platform uniquely combines data science, plant science, and food science to create innovative food, ingredient, and feed products — starting with a better seed. 
Our business is comprised of two reportable segments — our Ingredients segment and our Fresh segment. Our Ingredients segment is currently focused on commercializing soybean and yellow pea products, including soy-based specialty vegetable oils, aquaculture and animal feed, and ultra-high protein (“UHP”) soy-based ingredients that have the potential to eliminate costly water and energy intensive processing associated with producing products for the food and feed markets, alleviating supply constraints to help bring plant-based proteins to scale. Our Fresh segment, which primarily includes our wholly-owned subsidiary, J&J Produce, Inc. (doing business as “J&J Family of Farms”), is focused on growing, packing and selling fresh produce products to major retail and food service customers.
Background
We are incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, where the majority of our research and development activities are managed. We operate a food grade white flake and soy flour manufacturing operation in Creston, Iowa and a soy crushing facility in Seymour, Indiana. We also supply fresh produce through packing, distribution, and growing locations in the southeastern states of the United States, and process dry peas in North Dakota.
On September 29, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Star Peak Corp II (“STPC”), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated a merger (the “Closing”) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 8, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among STPC, STPC Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of STPC (“Merger Sub”), and Benson Hill, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Legacy Benson Hill”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination between STPC and Legacy Benson Hill was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Legacy Benson Hill, with Legacy Benson Hill surviving the transaction as a wholly-owned subsidiary of STPC (the “Merger”). On the Closing Date, STPC changed its name to Benson Hill, Inc. and Legacy Benson Hill changed its name to Benson Hill Holdings, Inc. As a consequence of the Merger, we became the successor to a company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). Our future results of consolidated operations and financial position may not be comparable to historical results as a result of the Merger.
Overview
Our purpose is to create better food and ingredients from the beginning. Genomics has been used for decades to develop crops for our food system, but most agricultural companies have focused almost exclusively on increasing the yield of a few crops, resulting in commodity ingredients and a food system based on the quantity of calories available. While focus on quantity is important, it often came with trade-offs in nutrient density and flavor. 
Consumers are demanding food choices with more recognizable ingredients that benefit their health and the health of our planet. By combining proprietary data with artificial intelligence capabilities as well as advances in plant genomics with our go-to-market strategy, we believe we can accelerate the development and delivery of better food and ingredient options from the beginning—with a focus on both quantity and quality. Our approach aims to develop food, feed, and ingredients that fuel affordable scaling and product differentiation for evolving consumer preferences, with a particular focus on the exploding plant-based food market.
Our CropOS® food innovation engine is a proprietary, continuously learning and expanding product design and development platform that uses predictive breeding and other advanced breeding tools like CRISPR gene editing technology to tap into the vast, underutilized natural genetic diversity within a plant to unlock and restore desired attributes. We believe that the combination of the predictive capability of the CropOS® platform, the precision of our genomic tools, our Crop Accelerator (a controlled environment research facility that became operational in October 2021), and our extensive field testing network will enable us to develop differentiated products with targeted attributes much more quickly and cost effectively than traditional methods.
We are building an integrated go-to-market approach, leveraging the existing parts of the supply chain to create efficiencies and feedback loops between consumers, farmers, and seed developers that has been lacking across our siloed agri-food value chain. We are working to design products with the consumer in mind, contract with farmers to grow and buy back the harvest, preserve the product identity through processing, and ultimately sell food and ingredients directly to food companies, retailers, and others. We believe this integration and control of the product throughout the complete supply chain will allow us to link data to outcomes in our CropOS® platform to fuel the next generation of products. Additionally, we believe this product information linkage will enable us to optimize environmental and social impacts, as well as traceability throughout the supply chain.
We believe that our commitment to environmental and social issues impacting our planet and our purpose-driven culture are fundamental to our ability to achieve our mission. Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues help guide our thinking and approach throughout the development and commercialization of our products, and our innovative culture is rooted in our Core Values — Be Bold, Be Inspired and Be Real. Our mission is to partner with nature using technology as the gateway, leveraging genomics as a proven lever to advance the food system. We believe our leading technology platform, go-to-market strategy, and purpose-driven culture will allow us to bridge the divide between evolving consumer preferences and quality traits already present within the genetic diversity of plants, and we believe we are positioned to drive the evolution of the food system.
Evolving Food Industry
The current global food system was designed decades ago to increase calories to help feed a growing population. However, rapidly changing consumer trends and enabling technology such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence and gene sequencing create the opportunity for us to design better food and ingredients from the beginning by leveraging the natural genetic diversity within plants.
As awareness of diet-related health issues and environmental concerns grow, consumers are emphasizing a healthier lifestyle and a desire for nutritionally rich foods that are better tasting, less processed, and more sustainable. These trends are increasing demand for higher valued, premium segments of the food industry, such as plant-based protein products. Companies across the value chain are working to formulate new products for this category with a focus on taste, nutrition, traceability, and sustainability. Achieving cost parity with meat and affordable scaling is profoundly important to realize the full potential of this product category. As a result of these major trends, food companies are looking for specialty ingredients and foods that satisfy customers’ evolving needs and drive sustainable practices.
We believe the current food supply chain is siloed with fundamental disconnects that prevent it from adapting to rapidly changing consumer demands. Grain processors and food manufacturers are largely limited to commodity ingredients.
We believe innovation starts with a better seed delivered in a manner that benefits both farmers and consumers as well as our planet. At Benson Hill, we are building such a system with our leading technology platform and a go-to-market strategy that we believe will bridge the divide between evolving consumer preferences and the quality needed to deliver more nutritious, sustainable and affordable food and ingredients.
Our Strengths and Solution: Technology and CropOS® Platform
Designing better crops from the beginning means our design process starts with the consumer in mind. This approach to product development requires a unique assemblage of disciplines — specifically data science, plant science and food science. We designed our headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri to foster this intentional gathering of disciplines under one roof. Our headquarters occupies an approximately 160,000-square-foot facility, which boasts approximately 25,000 square feet of lab space. We are working on capturing consumer-relevant data on products through our food science department, along with insights from our integrated supply chain, from which we will draw meaningful and actionable linkages back to plants’ genetics and direct product development through a process we call food digitization.
We are developing products with our CropOS® platform through a three step, iterative “Design, Build, Test” process that improves in precision and intelligence with each turn of the flywheel. The key inputs to our approach are twofold. The first is an unparalleled data library comprising genotypic, phenotypic, and other ‘omic data on our crops, consumer insight data on our ingredients, and environmental data on our growing sites. The second is a robust machine learning capability, which leverages our data library to design before we build. We believe this combination of relevant data and advanced simulation gives us the opportunity to get our products to market more efficiently, faster, and on timelines that can more effectively respond to evolving consumer preferences and farmer needs.
In our Design step, the CropOS® platform employs a diverse array of simulations and predictions to execute the most efficient and cost-effective path to novel product development. The platform can consider billions of data points in millions of pipeline configurations to identify the starting parental plant breeding combinations, predict gene targets, and analyze optimal farm management and environmental conditions to guide eventual placement of improved varieties in the field. These state-of-the-art platform capabilities and enabling technologies allow us to assess the probability of success early in the research and development process, focusing resources and avoiding potentially expensive late-stage failures. In turn, this allows for a larger breadth of products to be designed.
Once an optimal path is identified, we enter our Build step. In this stage of our development process, candidate products are created through predictive breeding and genome editing. Our proprietary suite of gene editing technologies and intellectual property portfolio enable us to predictably and precisely edit the plant’s genome. We can leverage our knowledge of plant gene functions to unlock and restore lost or muted genetic variation that is within the natural diversity of the plant or knock out genes that are unwanted. This approach is distinguished from transgenic, or “GMO” technology, in that we are advancing natural genetic variation that could be achieved using traditional breeding approaches rather than introducing genes foreign to the species, as is the case with GMO approaches.
Through our Crop Accelerator facility that we opened in October 2021 in St. Louis, Missouri, the Build step of our process is being accelerated using this controlled environment, indoor product development facility. This approximately 47,000 square-foot facility features approximately 20,000 square feet of dynamically adaptive Conviron® growth houses and chambers, equipped with sophisticated sensor and environmental controls, including multi-channel LEDs, imaging capabilities, additive carbon dioxide, and temperature, humidity, and lighting controls. The Crop Accelerator enables rapid testing and target candidate selection, and the insights and data points gathered during each growing cycle further enhance the predictive capabilities of the CropOS® platform. We believe this cycle of feedback will accelerate our ability to develop new offerings, including continued expansion of our portfolio of proprietary ingredients.
After a potential commercial product is built, it then enters our Test step where it is evaluated within our testing network (comprised of internal and third-party sites and capabilities) of hundreds of field-level testing research and production sites. We believe our predictive optimization capabilities have the potential to maximize the return on our genetics by using proprietary placement models, which are built on environmental and performance data to predict where to contract acres to lift protein content. We then use digital agriculture technology to collect on-farm data through our grower data partnership program and other relationships to enhance the CropOS® platform, further feeding our data flywheel. We believe grower data partnership programs and other relationships with our farmers will be integral to developing and executing our ESG strategy.
Environmental, Social and Governance Strategy
Environmental and social impact is inherent to our purpose and helps to guide decisions and work across our company. We believe our ESG strategy is fundamental to achieving our vision and long-term profitability. We are striving to optimize the environmental impact of our facilities and operations, but we recognize the greatest potential for impact is through our product development process of designing seeds, ingredients, and food that drives social and environmental benefit throughout the food value chain, providing benefits to all stakeholders.
At the farm level, we believe our integrated business model will enable additional revenue opportunities for farmers through ecosystem service markets and allow us to drive conservation and regeneration farming practices. At the processing level, we are designing products that we believe will reduce water and energy intensive processing steps. And at the product level, we are designing products that we believe will enable improved scaling, affordability, and adoption of end products with environmental and social benefits, such as plant-based meats and dairy alternatives.
Benson Hill has developed an internal strategy including critical policies and processes to manage and assess our ESG success and impact. As a company, some of our primary ESG goals are the following:
Improve consumer access to nutrient rich and sustainable food choices. Our ESG strategy is focused on developing ingredients and products that meet the sustainability and nutritional demands of consumers. Benson Hill uses state of the art breeding tools and crop production practices across the crop portfolio to deliver on these endpoints. As an example, we are currently working on creating high protein ingredient options for plant-based meat manufacturers to develop and mature their existing ingredient supply chains. We believe our products are positioned to assist those manufacturers in meeting ingredient demand and reducing environmental impacts, facilitating the expansion of plant-based foods, and improving affordability and accessibility for such products across the U.S.
Develop nutrient rich and sustainable products and ingredient options for food companies and retailers. Driven by growing consumer demand and climate-related risks, many food manufacturers have set ESG measurement and reporting programs, such as reporting on their own greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission production. Benson Hill is positioned to assist in meeting food manufacturers' goals of reducing GHG emissions in their scope 3 supply chains by developing products with reduced environmental impact. For example, Benson Hill has conducted a consultant-led life cycle assessment on one of our UHP soybean ingredient products, and our preliminary results show a significant reduction in required GHG emissions and water use due to the reduction of processing when compared to the average commodity soy protein concentrate. We believe this reduction in GHG emissions and water, among other product claims, will support our food manufacturer customers’ ESG objectives.
Improve farm cost-effectiveness and sustainability. Our farmer partners are critical to our commercial success, and we value these relationships greatly. Benson Hill’s on-farm ESG strategy addresses two key concerns for farmers — first, ongoing pressure to reduce food production costs, and second, best practices for land and soil stewardship to ensure long-term viability. Our strategy is to directly collect agronomic performance data from the farm and provide recommendations for land conservation and regenerative practices, as well as enable profitable opportunities through input reduction or alternative revenue streams. Agronomic data collection will inform data-based decision making in our product life cycle assessments, company GHG emissions assessments, product development and many other business functions.
Meet consumer demands for supply chain transparency and traceability. Through our business model, we intend to maintain the integrity of our proprietary products through each stage of the supply chain, until the product is sold to our customers. We believe this enables us to enhance transparency and traceability, which is appealing to our customers. This approach provides us direct line of sight to data we intend to collect, as well as creates strong partnerships with our seed growers, farmers, and processing partners. We are working toward being able to measure the environmental impact at the farm through processing as well as at the product level. Through improved traceability capabilities, Benson Hill will also continue to seek out and leverage third-party certifications, such as the Non-GMO Project Verified certification, meeting certain demands for both food manufacturers and consumers.
Recruit and retain purpose-driven talent. Current research suggests employees are increasingly interested in working for companies that have an integrated ESG mission and purpose. Benson Hill has developed processes and internal programs, such as employee-led committees, that promote working together and re-thinking how we do business within our company, with our partners, and across the supply chain. We are working to develop teams that are grounded in a spirit of diversity, equality, and inclusion, and encouraged to think more innovatively, boldly, and transparently. Our goal is a workplace that is not just productive, but one of mutual respect and an environment for team members to continuously develop as professionals.
In order to measure and accelerate our ongoing work around ESG impacts, we have a highly experienced ESG team that is working to formalize our structure and focus in 2022 and beyond. With a depth of knowledge in food retail, distribution, agricultural production, and government relations, our sustainability team is committed to cultivating sustainability within the food system. As an organization, we are committed to continuous improvement. The team will focus on advancing our strategy, policies, and practices and is committed to quantifying our environmental, social impact, and corporate governance efforts both within Benson Hill and in our work across the value chain.
Benson Hill’s ESG strategy and business objectives will continue to progress and evolve based on industry shifts and stakeholders' needs. We believe our long-term profitability goals and our ESG strategy are mutually inclusive concepts.
Business Segments, Growth Strategies, and Products
Benson Hill’s business is comprised of two segments — our Ingredients Business and our Fresh Business. Our Ingredients Business aims to combine our seed innovation through our CropOS® platform with critical infrastructure capabilities and best practices in the field to develop and commercialize differentiated products. We are currently developing a diversified portfolio spanning the following key markets — protein ingredients, aquaculture and specialty animal feed, and vegetable oils. For each product, our research and development efforts are focused on quality-centric traits, such as nutrient density, digestibility, flavor, ingredient functionality, and sustainability, as well as yield potential and agronomic improvements. Our Fresh Business, which primarily includes our wholly-owned subsidiary, J&J Produce, Inc., is focused on growing, packing, and selling fresh produce products to major retail and food service customers. 
Integral to our go-to-market strategy are our infrastructure capabilities along with our partnerships across the supply chain. Unlike traditional agriculture-focused crop improvement companies that focus their impact on development of the seed and sell to the farmer, we are building an integrated supply chain through directly owned or controlled assets, tolling agreements, and strategic partnerships in order to provide adequate capacity and influence throughout the food and ingredient supply chain. We believe this approach ensures the integrity of our products, and enables the efficient development, commercialization, and scaling of our product offerings. Importantly, it also enables a more direct and intimate relationship with those who will be realizing the benefits of those products—i.e. retailers, consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) companies, and consumers—which informs our product development.
Our partnerships with farmers are an essential part of our supply chain. Within the traditional agriculture industry supply chain, farmers typically sell to elevators or processors who operate a high volume/low margin business to store commodity crops and convert them into largely aquaculture and specialty animal feed and industrial products. Our strategy is to partner with farmers who grow our seeds using appropriate agronomic and identity preservation practices and, in turn, we purchase their harvest for ultimate sale to an end-user customer. We believe structuring the relationship in this way will better allow us to drive best practices for on-farm sustainability, ensure traceability of our products, and help create new markets and profitable opportunities for farmers.
Once we obtain the harvest from the farmer, we secure the processing and distribution capacity that is appropriate for the product to meet our customers where they are. CPG and retailer customers sell directly to consumers. We share their focus on the end consumer in order to better align incentives, focus product development, and deliver our products through a channel that best serves their supply chain with the high quality standards, traceability, and sustainability data that consumers desire.
Our growth strategy, or “growth playbook,” for our business segments is based on a replicable process that we believe will enable us to remain at the forefront of food and agriculture innovation.
Step 1: Create the foundation — At this initial step, we are focused on entering the market through an owned or controlled channel, selling non-proprietary products to processors, food and ingredient companies, aquaculture and specialty animal feed customers, and retailers. We use this time to build relationship across the value chain and invest in the data to inform our CropOS® platform with low capital investment.
Step 2: Integrated route to market — In this step, we introduce our proprietary products in the channel to prove the product concept, scale, ensure traceability, and catalyze customer demand for our differentiated products. This stage may include the use of owned or third-party processing capabilities, and exploring strategic partnerships that can further expand production capacities.
Step 3: Broad adoption — We believe this will be the most asset-light step of our strategy where we intend to focus on maximizing the benefit and scale of our proprietary products by building partnerships and licensing relationships for our products. In this step, it is envisioned that we will grow beyond our proving ground acreage and increase commercial and supply chain efficiencies by leveraging others’ existing infrastructure. 
As part of our growth strategy, we may pursue merger and acquisition opportunities to expand our capabilities and grow our industry and geographic footprint. Our management has a demonstrated track record of execution and integration for strategic mergers and acquisitions, including Dakota Dry Bean Inc. (doing business as “Dakota Ingredients”) and J&J Produce, Inc. (doing business as “J&J Family of Farms”), as well as our most recent acquisitions of a food-grade white flake and soy flour manufacturing operation in Creston, Iowa and a soy crushing facility in Seymour, Indiana.
Ingredients Business Segment
Our Ingredients Business is focused on enhancing soy and yellow pea with proprietary ingredients serving multiple protein markets, including the fast-growing plant-based meat alternative market. Our target end markets for the Ingredients Business include protein ingredients, aquaculture and specialty animal feed, and vegetable oils. Our target customer base includes ingredient companies, CPG companies, aquaculture production and feed companies, food-service operations, and grocery retail.
Soy Ingredient Products
We are in Step 2 of our growth playbook for our soy ingredients business, and are currently working to develop and commercialize a portfolio of proprietary soy products targeted toward the protein ingredients, aquaculture and specialty animal feed, and vegetable oils markets, which include the following:
•TruVail™ plant-based protein ingredients derived from UHP soybeans for application in human food markets.
•Bright Day™ high-protein and low anti-nutrient soybean meal for aquaculture and animal feed markets.
•Veri™ high oleic, low linoleic cooking oil.
The foundation of our soybean genetics derives from certain assets we acquired in 2019 from Schillinger Genetics, Inc., an Iowa-based company that used traditional breeding methods for over 20 years to develop high-protein and specialty, non-GMO soybean varieties. We use our CropOS® platform to develop and test our soybean varieties, help identify the best environments for protein production and agronomic performance, and advance our breeding pipeline.
As part of our soy ingredient business, we operate a food-grade white flake and soy flour manufacturing operation in Creston, Iowa and a soy crushing facility in Seymour, Indiana, which process the Company’s proprietary soybean varieties for distribution to end customers. In addition, we also partner with third-party processors as needed to obtain the crushing, processing, and refining capacity for our growing business in soy ingredients. 
•Protein Ingredients Market: Soy, specifically soy protein concentrate (“SPC”), is the number one protein ingredient used in plant-based meat applications. SPC is largely made through the processing of defatted soy flour, which is costly and water- and energy-intensive. Our TruVail™ brand's initial offerings include a high-protein soy flour that is a less processed alternative to SPC, as well as texturized protein ingredients for broad use across soy protein applications, including for plant-based alternatives. 
•Aquaculture and Specialty Animal Feed: Soybean meal is an ideal protein source for swine, poultry, and fish due to its availability, cost, high protein content, and balanced amino acid profile. However, its use is restricted because, like many plant proteins, soybean meal has a high concentration of anti-nutritional compounds (“ANCs”), including oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose that can have a negative effect on protein digestibility, leading to low energy values, poor metabolism, and excessive secretion impacting water quality in aquaculture systems. Apart from anti-nutritional factors, the steady historical decline in protein content of soy — an unintended consequence of breeding primarily for yield and other agronomic traits — has rendered soy meal a continually less valuable feed ingredient.
Our Bright Day™ pipeline of soy products for aquaculture and specialty animal feed includes a high protein soy meal that is low in anti-nutrients and a low-cost, sustainable SPC substitute. As we build this portfolio of products, we intend to devote additional research and development resources toward developing future generations of products with improved protein qualities to further improve the value of feed ingredients options available to formulators that seek to prioritize fish and animal health, sustainability, and profitability of their operations.
•Vegetable Oils: In 2020, we launched Veri™, a non-GMO, high-heat soy cooking oil that is rich with omega-9 fatty acids. Our Veri™ brand soy oil is high in oleic acid and low in linolenic acid with an optimized fatty acid profile from both a human consumption and food service operations standpoint. 
Yellow Pea Ingredients
We are in Step 1 of our growth playbook for yellow pea, and in 2025, we expect to enter Step 2 with the start of commercialization of our first proprietary yellow pea protein ingredient products through our existing supply chain infrastructure, including premium texturized and un-texturized yellow pea protein concentrates.
Despite being one of the fastest growing protein ingredients for plant-based meats, yellow pea has received comparatively little genomic innovation to date. The pea-based protein ingredient primarily used today by many plant-based meat companies, such as Beyond Meat, is pea protein isolate (“PPI”). The PPI production process, similar to SPC, is expensive as well as water- and energy- intensive; however, such processing is necessary to concentrate protein to higher levels and help ameliorate native off-putting flavors of pea.
We have sequenced and assembled a reference genome for yellow pea — a high resolution “genomic map” — that, in combination with our CropOS® platform, is enabling us to accelerate our yellow pea breeding program. As a result, we believe we will develop differentiated varieties of yellow pea for first commercial plantings in 2024. We are working on a pipeline of products that has the potential to significantly reduce off-flavors, increase the protein content of the plant, and ultimately reduce or displace the need for expensive, water- and energy-intensive processing steps typically required for ingredients used in plant-based meat alternatives.
Our subsidiary Dakota Dry Bean Inc., an upper Midwest-based yellow pea processor, has an established channel with commodity pea protein concentrate, split peas, pea flour and pea fiber. We have expanded and upgraded the capabilities of Dakota Ingredients to better serve the pet and human food markets. Through our elite grower program and integrated production capabilities, the operation can now test premium yellow pea varieties and supply ingredients that are traceable and meet certain food-grade, kosher, and non-GMO certification standards. 
Fresh Business Segment
Our Fresh Business, which primarily operates under our J&J Family of Farms brand, is focused on growing, packing and selling fresh produce products to major retail and food service customers. J&J Family of Farms is a Florida-based leading national grower, packer and shipper of field-grown vegetables and fruits and value-added produce on over 13,000 acres of farmland under management and multiple packing and cooling facilities. In addition to being prepared to grow a significant volume of sweet and hot peppers, yellow squash, zucchini, cucumbers, eggplant, and melon for commercial distribution, J&J Family of Farms has long-standing retail, grocer, and food service relationships and is actively working on new grower relationships to further expand capacity to deliver premium quality produce throughout the year to retail and food service. During the second quarter of 2022, we expect to complete the construction of our new facility and growing operation in Vero Beach, Florida, designed to expand our capacity to grow fresh produce, and engage in commercial packaging and distribution. In late 2021, we completed our first commercial produce plantings at the new facility. 
Through 2021 we made investments to develop proprietary genetics to differentiate fresh produce products currently on the market. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we deprioritized these efforts and ceased research and development investment in our Fresh Business. Our current investment focus and innovation efforts are centered on executing our strategic plans in the Ingredients Business.
Competitors
We believe that our technology platform coupled with our integrated go-to-market approach is unique to Benson Hill and sets us apart from others in the agriculture and food markets, but we do compete with others in certain areas of our business. For example, we compete with seeds and trait companies as well as smaller biotechnology and ag-tech companies, particularly for grower contracting and access to acres. Key competitors in this space include Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta, and Pairwise. For our ingredients and fresh products that are commercialized, we compete with food and feed ingredient companies and fresh produce companies. Key competitors in these industries include Archer Daniels Midland Company, International Flavors & Fragrances, Cargill, and Lipman. In addition, advancements in fields such as gene editing, biologics, digital agriculture, data science, and artificial intelligence may enable disruptive technology that could alter the competitive landscape for food and agriculture. 
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property and proprietary protection for our product candidates and technology related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, licensing and filing United States and certain non-U.S. patents and patent applications related to our technology, products and product candidates, and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets and/or contractual provisions to develop and maintain our proprietary position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have licensed or filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we have licensed or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and technology. Moreover, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. 
While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry — Risks Relating to Intellectual Property.”
As of December 31, 2021, we have filed patents and patent applications in approximately 41 distinct non-plant germplasm patent families, including approximately 13 granted U.S. patents, 32 pending U.S. patent applications, 12 granted non-U.S. patents, and 70 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) and non-U.S. patent applications. Within this portfolio, approximately 84 patents and patent applications relate to the trait genes of plants and 45 relate to enabling technology (including gene editing-focused patents and patent applications). The Company also has approximately 65 granted and 17 pending soybean patents. In addition to these patents and patent applications filed by Benson Hill, we also hold licenses from other parties related to certain products and activities.
We anticipate that our currently granted U.S. and non-U.S. patents will expire approximately between 2024 and 2042, subject to potential extensions. Individual patent terms extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which patent applications are filed, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional application to which priority is claimed. Under certain circumstances, a patent term can be extended. For example, in the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in reviewing and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 24 U.S. trademarks and 11 pending U.S. trademark applications, and we had 59 registered non-U.S. trademarks and 62 pending non-U.S. trademark applications.
Research and Development
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 150 employees dedicated to our product and platform development. This team has technical expertise in data science, machine learning software, genome engineering, molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics and genetic engineering, plant physiology, and plant breeding. The activities of this team are conducted principally at our St. Louis, Missouri facilities. We have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in this capability. Our research and development expenses were $40.6 million, $29.5 million and $24.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 456 individuals in total, including approximately 450 full-time employees.
Regulatory
We are subject to laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. This includes laws and regulations governing biotechnology and food companies related to the development, approval, manufacturing, import, marketing, and sale of our products.
Regulation of Plant Biotechnology Products
The three primary agencies with responsibility for regulation of plant biotechnology products in the United States are the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (“APHIS”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). APHIS regulates plant biotechnology products to ensure that they do not pose a plant pest risk under the Plant Protection Act. The EPA regulates pesticides (including plant-incorporated protectants) pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”). The FDA regulates food and animal feed under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”).
Plant gene editing uses relatively new technology and the regulatory landscape continues to evolve in this area. Under the USDA’s recently revised regulations, certain categories of our products currently in development using gene editing may be exempt from certain regulations related to genetic engineering under the Plant Protection Act because they could otherwise 
have been developed through conventional breeding techniques, which may include gene edited soybeans or yellow peas. Other plant biotechnology products currently in development may be subject to certain regulations related to genetic engineering under the Plant Protection Act in the future. The FDA offers a voluntary consultation process to determine whether foods derived from plant biotechnology products would require regulatory review and approval before marketing such products.
Other countries also have laws and regulations that apply to plant biotechnology products. The regulatory landscape around gene edited plant biotechnology products varies in each country and continues to evolve.
