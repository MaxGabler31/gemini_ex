Item 1. Business
The Company
 
The Registrant, ESCO Technologies Inc. (ESCO), is a global provider of highly engineered products and solutions to diverse and growing end-markets that include the commercial and military aerospace, space, healthcare, wireless, consumer electronics, electric utility and renewable energy industries. ESCO is focused on generating predictable and profitable long-term growth through continued innovation and expansion of its product offerings across each of its business segments. ESCO conducts its business through a number of wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. ESCO and its subsidiaries are referred to in this Report as “the Company.”
 
ESCO was incorporated in Missouri in August 1990 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co. (Emerson) to be the indirect holding company for several Emerson subsidiaries, which were primarily in the defense business. Ownership of the Company was spun off by Emerson to its shareholders on October 19, 1990, through a special distribution. Since that time, through a series of acquisitions and divestitures, the Company has shifted its primary focus from defense contracting to the production and supply of engineered products and systems marketed to utility, industrial, aerospace and commercial users. ESCO’s corporate strategy is centered on a multi-segment approach designed to enhance the strength and sustainability of sales and earnings growth by providing lower risk through diversification. Its stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where its ticker symbol is “ESE”.
 
The Company’s fiscal year ends September 30. Throughout this document, unless the context indicates otherwise, references to a year (for example 2018) refer to the Company’s fiscal year ending on September 30 of that year.
 
The Company is organized based on the products and services it offers, and classifies its business operations in segments for financial reporting purposes. As a result of the acquisitions of Plastique and Fremont discussed in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” beginning in the second quarter of 2016 Management expanded the presentation of its reporting segments to include a fourth segment, Technical Packaging. Prior period segment amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
 
The Company’s four segments, together with the significant domestic and foreign operating subsidiaries within each segment during 2018, are as follows:
 
Filtration/Fluid Flow (Filtration):
 PTI Technologies Inc. (PTI)
 VACCO Industries (VACCO)
 Crissair, Inc. (Crissair)
 Westland Technologies, Inc. (Westland)

Their respective businesses are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” See also Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Forward-Looking Information.”
 
ESCO is continually seeking ways to reduce costs, streamline its business processes and enhance the branding of its products and services. In October 2015 the Company announced several restructuring and realignment actions involving the Test and USG segments which were completed during 2016, including closing ETS-Lindgren’s operating subsidiaries in Germany and the United Kingdom and consolidating their operations into other existing Test facilities; eliminating certain underperforming product line offerings in Test primarily related to lower margin international shielding end markets; reducing headcount in Test’s U.S. business; and closing Doble’s Brazil operating office and consolidating Doble’s South American sales and support activities.
 
During 2018 the Company undertook several restructuring actions involving the closure of Doble’s sales offices in Norway, China, Mexico and Dubai as part of its consolidation of the global distribution channels of Doble and Morgan Schaffer. Since the end of fiscal 2018, Doble has sold its headquarters facility in Watertown, Massachusetts and plans to consolidate its headquarters operations into a single, more cost-efficient facility in Marlborough, Massachusetts over the next 12 to 15 months. Also during fiscal 2019, Plastique intends to reduce its operating costs and gain efficiencies through a restructuring that involves closing its administrative and product development center in Tunbridge Wells, UK and integrating those activities into its existing manufacturing locations in Nottingham, UK and Poznan, Poland.
 
ESCO is also continually seeking opportunities to supplement its growth by making strategic acquisitions. During 2017, the Company acquired Mayday, a leading manufacturer of mission-critical bushings, pins, sleeves and precision-tolerance machined components for landing gear, rotor heads, engine mounts, flight controls, and actuation systems for the aerospace and defense industries; Hi-Tech, a full-service metal processor offering aerospace original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Tier 1 suppliers a large portfolio of processing services including anodizing, cadmium and zinc-nickel plating, organic coatings, non-destructive testing, and heat treatment; NRG, a global market leader in the design and manufacture of decision support tools for the renewable energy industry, primarily wind; and the assets of Morgan Schaffer Inc., which designs, develops, manufactures and markets an integrated offering of dissolved gas analysis, oil testing, and data management solutions which enhance the ability of electric utilities to accurately monitor the health of critical power transformers. In August 2017, the Company acquired the assets of Vanguard Instruments Company (Vanguard Instruments), a test equipment provider serving the global electric utility market. In March 2018, the Company acquired the assets of Manta Test Systems Ltd., a manufacturer of self-contained protective relay test systems for use by electric utilities and their service companies. More information about these 2017 and 2018 acquisitions as well as the Company’s acquisition activity during 2016 is provided in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Some of the Company’s products are sold directly or indirectly to the U.S. Government under contracts with the Army, Navy and Air Force and subcontracts with prime contractors of such entities. Direct and indirect sales to the U.S. Government, primarily related to the Filtration segment, accounted for approximately 20%, 20% and 14% of the Company’s total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company owns or has other rights in various forms of intellectual property (i.e., patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, mask works, trade secrets and other items). As a major supplier of engineered products to industrial and commercial markets, the Company emphasizes developing intellectual property and protecting its rights therein. However, the scope of protection afforded by intellectual property rights, including those of the Company, is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual issues. Some intellectual property rights, such as patents, have only a limited term. Also, there can be no assurance that third parties will not infringe or design around the Company’s intellectual property. Policing unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult, and infringement and misappropriation are persistent problems for many companies, particularly in some international markets. In addition, the Company may not elect to pursue an unauthorized user due to the high costs and uncertainties associated with litigation. Further, there can be no assurance that courts will ultimately hold issued patents or other intellectual property valid and enforceable. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
 
A number of products in the Filtration segment are based on patented or otherwise proprietary technology that sets them apart from the competition, such as VACCO’s proprietary quieting technology and Westland’s signature reduction solutions.
 
In the Test segment, patent protection has been sought for significant inventions. Examples of such inventions include novel designs for window and door assemblies used in shielded enclosures and anechoic chambers, improved acoustic techniques for sound isolation and a variety of unique antennas. In addition, the Test segment holds a number of patents, and has patents pending, on products used to perform wireless device testing.

In the USG segment, the segment policy is to seek patent and/or other forms of intellectual property protection on new and improved products, components of products and methods of operation for its businesses, as such developments are made. Doble is pursuing patent protection on improvements to its line of diagnostic equipment and NERC CIP compliance tools. Doble also holds an extensive library of apparatus performance information useful to Doble employees and to entities that generate, distribute or consume electric energy. Doble makes part of this library available to registered users via an Internet portal. NRG is pursuing patent protection on its upcoming line of bat deterrent systems, which are expected to reduce bat mortality at windfarms. In 2018, NRG acquired patented direct detect LIDAR technology from Pentalum Technologies Ltd. with uses in wind resource assessment, wind farm operation, forecasting and research.
 
The Technical Packaging segment emphasizes advanced manufacturing technology and methods. For example, the TEQ 3-in-1 tooling system, with an added stacking tool, provides a competitive edge over traditional thermoform tooling; and Plastique’s “Cure-In-The-Mold” technology produces high-quality, smooth-surface, thin-wall packaging products which may be made from sustainable virgin crop fibers or virgin pulp. The segment’s intellectual property consists chiefly of trade secrets and proprietary technology embodied in products for which the Company is the only approved source, such as the TEQconnexTM and TEQethelyeneTM single polymer sterile barrier medical packaging systems for which TEQ owns the validation studies required to register the package with the FDA.
 
The Company considers its patents and other intellectual property to be of significant value in each of its segments.
 
Backlog
 
Total Company backlog of firm orders at September 30, 2018 was $382.8 million, representing an increase of $5.7 million (1.5%) from the backlog of $377.1 million on September 30, 2017. The backlog at September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively, by segment, was $204.2 million and $203.1 million for Filtration; $122.3 million and $114.8 million for Test; $40.7 million and $35.6 million for USG; and $15.5 million and $23.6 million for Technical Packaging. The Company estimates that as of September 30, 2018 domestic customers accounted for approximately 71% of the Company’s total firm orders and international customers accounted for approximately 29%. Of the total Company backlog at September 30, 2018, approximately 83% is expected to be completed in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.
Purchased Components and Raw Materials
 
The Company’s products require a wide variety of components and materials. Although the Company has multiple sources of supply for most of its materials requirements, certain components and raw materials are supplied by sole source vendors, and the Company’s ability to perform certain contracts depends on their performance. In the past, these required raw materials and various purchased components generally have been available in sufficient quantities. However, the Company does have some risk of shortages of materials or components due to reliance on sole or limited sources of supply. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
 
The Filtration segment purchases supplies from a wide array of vendors. In most instances, multiple vendors of raw materials are screened during a qualification process to ensure that there will not be an interruption of supply should one of them underperform or discontinue operations. Nonetheless, in some situations, there is a risk of shortages due to reliance on a limited number of suppliers or because of price fluctuations due to the nature of the raw materials. For example, aerospace-grade titanium and gaseous helium, important raw materials for our Filtration segment subsidiaries, may at times be in short supply.
 
The Test segment is a vertically integrated supplier of electro-magnetic (EM) shielding and RF absorbing products, producing most of its critical RF components. This segment purchases significant quantities of raw materials such as polyurethane foam, polystyrene beads, steel, aluminum, copper, nickel and wood. Accordingly, it is subject to price fluctuations in the worldwide raw materials markets. While ETS-Lindgren has long-term contracts with a number of its suppliers, it is vulnerable to changes in trade policies.
 
The USG segment manufactures electronic instrumentation through a network of regional contract manufacturers under long term contracts. In general, USG purchases the same kinds of component parts as do other electronic products manufacturers, and it purchases only a limited amount of raw materials.
 
The Technical Packaging segment selects suppliers initially on the basis of their ability to meet requirements, and then conducts ongoing evaluations and ratings of the supplier’s performance based on a documented evaluation process. The segment purchases raw materials according to a documented and controlled process assuring that purchased materials meet defined specifications. Thermoplastics represent the largest percentage of raw material spend, with purchase prices subject to fluctuation depending on petrochemical industry pricing and capacity in the plastic resin market.

Competition
 
Competition in the Company’s major markets is broadly based and global in scope. Competition can be particularly intense during periods of economic slowdown, and this has been experienced in some of the Company’s markets. Although the Company is a leading supplier in several of the markets it serves, it maintains a relatively small share of the business in many of the other markets it serves. Individual competitors range in size from annual revenues of less than $1 million to billion-dollar enterprises. Because of the specialized nature of the Company’s products, its competitive position with respect to its products cannot be precisely stated. In the Company’s major served markets, competition is driven primarily by quality, technology, price and delivery performance. See also Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
 
Primary competitors of the Filtration segment include Pall Corporation, Moog, Inc., Sofrance, CLARCOR Inc., PneuDraulics, Marotta Controls, and Parker Hannifin.
 
The Test segment is a global leader in EM shielding. Significant competitors in this market include Rohde & Schwarz GMBH, Microwave Vision SA (MVG), TDK RF Solutions Inc., Albatross GmbH, IMEDCO AG, and Universal Shielding Corp..
 
Significant competitors of the USG segment include OMICRON electronics Corp., Megger Group Limited, Vaisala, and Qualitrol Company LLC (a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation).
 
Significant Competitors of the Technical Packaging segment include Nelipak Corporation, Prent Corporation, Placon Corporation, Poli Marian Holz, and Sonoco/Alloyd.
 
Research and Development
 
Research and development and the Company’s technological expertise are important factors in the Company’s business. Research and development programs are designed to develop technology for new products or to extend or upgrade the capability of existing products, and to enhance their commercial potential. The Company performs research and development at its own expense, and also engages in research and development funded by customers. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for financial information about the Company’s research and development expenditures.
Environmental Matters
 
The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup relating to environmental matters. It is difficult to estimate the potential costs of such matters and the possible impact of these costs on the Company at this time due in part to: the uncertainty regarding the extent of pollution; the complexity and changing nature of Government laws and regulations and their interpretations; the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies and methods; the uncertain level of insurance or other types of cost recovery; the uncertain level of the Company’s responsibility for any contamination; the possibility of joint and several liability with other contributors under applicable law; and the ability of other contributors to make required contributions toward cleanup costs. Based on information currently available, the Company does not believe that the aggregate costs involved in the resolution of any of its environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
Government Contracts
 
The Company contracts with the U.S. Government and subcontracts with prime contractors of the U.S. Government. Although VACCO and Westland have a number of “cost-plus” Government contracts, the Company’s Government contracts also include firm fixed-price contracts under which work is performed and paid for at a fixed amount without adjustment for the actual costs experienced in connection with the contracts. All Government prime contracts and virtually all of the Company’s Government subcontracts provide that they may be terminated at the convenience of the Government or the customer. Upon such termination, the Company is entitled to receive equitable compensation from the customer. See “Marketing and Sales” in this Item 1, and Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional information regarding Government contracts and related risks.
