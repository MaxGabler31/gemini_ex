ITEM 1.
BUSINESS 
 Molecular Templates, Inc., or Molecular, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of differentiated, targeted, biologic therapeutics for cancer and other serious diseases. Molecular utilizes its proprietary biologic drug platform to design and generate engineered toxin bodies, or ETBs, which Molecular believes provide a differentiated mechanism of action that may be beneficial in patients resistant to currently available cancer therapeutics. ETBs use a genetically engineered version of the Shiga-like Toxin A subunit, or SLTA, a ribosome inactivating bacterial protein. In its wild-type form, SLT is thought to induce its own entry into a cell when proximal to the cell surface membrane, self-route to the cytosol, and enzymatically and irreversibly shut down protein synthesis via ribosome inactivation. SLTA is normally coupled to its cognate Shiga-like Toxin B subunit, or SLTB, to target the CD77 cell surface marker, a non-internalizing glycosphingolipid. In Molecular’s scaffold, a genetically engineered SLTA subunit with no cognate SLTB component is genetically fused to antibody domains or fragments specific to a target, resulting in a biologic therapeutic that can identify the particular target and specifically kill the cell. The antibody domains may be substituted with other antibody domains having different specificities to allow for the rapid development of new drugs to selected targets in cancer and other serious diseases. 
 ETBs combine the specificity of an antibody with SLTA’s potent mechanism of cell destruction. Based on the disease setting, Molecular has created ETBs that have reduced immunogenicity and are capable of delivering additional payloads into a target cell. Immunogenicity is the ability of a foreign substance to provoke an immune response in a host. ETBs have relatively predictable pharmacokinetic, or PK, profiles and can be rapidly screened for desired activity in robust cell-based and animal-model assays. Because SLTA can induce internalization against non- and poorly-internalizing receptors, the universe of targets for ETBs should be substantially larger than that seen with antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, which are not likely to be effective if the target does not readily internalize the ADC payload. 
 ETBs have a differentiated mechanism of cell kill in cancer therapeutics (the inhibition of protein synthesis via ribosome destruction), and Molecular has preclinical and clinical data demonstrating the utility of these molecules in chemotherapy-refractory cancers. ETBs have shown good tolerability in multiple animal models as well as a generally favorable tolerability profile in Molecular’s clinical studies to date. Molecular believes the target specificity of ETBs, their ability to self-internalize, their potent and differentiated mechanism of cell kill and their tolerability profile provide opportunities for the clinical development of these agents to address multiple cancer types. 
 Molecular’s initial approach to drug development in oncology involves the selection of lead compounds to validated targets in cancer. Molecular is developing ETBs for various targets, including PD-L1, HER2, and CD38. PD-L1 is central to immune checkpoint pathways and is a validated target expressed in a variety of solid tumor cancers. HER2 is clinically validated as a target for the treatment of solid tumors including breast and gastric cancer. CD38 has been validated as a meaningful clinical target in the treatment of multiple myeloma. MT-6402 (ETB targeting PD-L1), MT-5111 (ETB targeting HER2), and TAK-169, now known as MT-0169 (ETB targeting CD38) are all in ongoing Phase I studies. Molecular expects to provide periodic updates on these studies throughout 2022. Molecular continues to advance its pipeline of next-generation

ETBs targeting CTLA-4, TIGIT, TROP2, BCMA, SLAMF-7, and CD45 with a potential IND filing for its CTLA-4 program in the second half of 2022.
 Molecular has built up multiple core competencies around the creation and development of ETBs. Molecular developed the ETB technology in-house and continues to make iterative improvements in the scaffold and to identify new uses of the technology. Molecular also developed the proprietary process for manufacturing ETBs under Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulatory standards and continues to make improvements to its manufacturing processes. Molecular has conducted multiple cGMP manufacturing runs with its compounds and believes this process is robust and could support commercial production with gross margins that are similar to those seen with antibodies. 
 Challenges in Oncology 
 Existing mechanisms of action, the specific biochemical interaction through which a drug substance produces its pharmacological effect, are subject to numerous limitations in oncology. The clinical benefit of a given drug is a function of the biological properties of the drug, the target with which the drug interacts and the tumor indication being treated, but the relative contribution of each of these factors is difficult to separate. To date, significant challenges exist in identifying the most appropriate cancer targets, applying the most effective mechanisms of action and selecting the appropriate disease indications and most responsive patient populations for a particular drug or biologic. These challenges include the following: 

• | Availability of viable targets. The limited number of cancer targets addressable with currently available mechanisms of action; for example, targets appropriate for ADC approaches are relegated to those extracellular targets that already readily and efficiently self-internalize;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drug resistance. ADC approaches generally use chemotherapy payloads which damage DNA, or disrupt or prevent microtubule assembly, and can be subject to the same mechanisms of resistance as in general chemotherapy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limits of monotherapy. Established single-agent therapies are only effective in a minority of cancer patients;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Target identification and prioritization. Current approaches to target prioritization are not comprehensively systematic and do not leverage a complete understanding of a drug’s effect on a given tumor type to best identify high value targets in certain patient populations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical predictability of preclinical data. In vitro epitope selection on a given target may not be predictive of clinical optimization; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biomarker use and utility. Predictive biomarkers, the value and use of which are relatively new, are not uniformly used to proactively select responsive patient populations and/or preferred indications, which can drive longer development timelines with higher associated costs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Molecular’s Differentiated Approach 
 Molecular was founded on the principle that differentiated mechanisms of action are crucial for improving outcomes in oncology. Molecular has created a new ETB scaffold with a differentiated mechanism of action, coupled with a relatively predictable PK profile. Molecular’s ETB scaffold permits rapid screening for lead identification and easily scalable production, which Molecular believes offers an opportunity to provide meaningful clinical benefits in oncology with more cost-efficient research and development than current treatments. Molecular believes the differentiated biological activity inherent to the ETB scaffold, particularly the ability to induce internalization and employ a differentiated mechanism of cell kill, may allow for differentiated clinical benefit in patients as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care therapies. 
 Molecular likens the extensive de-immunization work it has conducted on SLTA to the chimerization of monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibody chimerization is a process for reducing immunogenicity when an antibody from one species is introduced into a different species. Chimerization has allowed for the wide-spread use of antibodies as human therapeutics across multiple disease settings. Molecular believes that the de-immunization of SLTA may allow for ETB use across multiple indications in oncology, including solid tumors, as well as other potential non-oncology indications. 
 Molecular has seen in both preclinical models and in its Phase I trials to date that the differentiated mechanism of action employed by its ETBs can be effective in chemo-resistant tumor cells. Molecular believes this creates the potential for a rapid characterization of efficacy in carefully designed clinical trials in relapsed and refractory settings, particularly when targeting tumor markers that persist after treatment with multiple lines of therapy and whose targeting has been shown to provide a survival benefit. Molecular also has seen preclinically that its ETBs can have additive or synergistic activity in combination with a number of small molecule agents including chemotherapeutics, immunomodulatory agents and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Molecular believes that the ability of ETBs to be additive or synergistic to a variety of current treatments may allow for combination therapy in earlier lines of disease.

Molecular believes it can develop ETBs against well-validated targets and new targets, enabling a phenotypically based clinical trial design that may result in shorter development timelines with lower associated costs. More specifically: 
  
• | Molecular’s research and design platform allows it to select lead ETBs from a comprehensive screen. Molecular’s ETB platform utilizes a suite of integrated technologies to screen ETB libraries for lead identification. Molecular performs initial preclinical screens on ETBs with lead selection around potency, affinity and expression. Critical components of Molecular’s approach include:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | the proprietary optimization of the genetic fusion between the immunoglobulin-targeting domain and Molecular’s proprietary SLTA scaffold;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | the proprietary de-immunizing modifications made to the SLTA scaffold, which reduce both adaptive and innate immune responses to ETBs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | comprehensive screening for potency, affinity and specificity against target expressing versus non-expressing cells; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | early evaluation of protein expression and stability of potential lead ETB candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Molecular’s ability to create lead ETBs to well-validated targets reduces the risk of target-mediated side effects and increases the likelihood of obtaining meaningful clinical benefit. Molecular has deployed its technology against targets in oncology that are central to disease progression and that are known to persist after a given modality has failed. Molecular believes these targets reduce the risk of clinical failure from either unacceptable target-mediated adverse events or from a failure to impact disease outcome because of loss of the target. For example, Molecular’s compound, MT-6402, targets the PD-L1 protein, found on the surface of tumor and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). PD-L1 is a validated target, as evidenced by the development of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, some of the most useful new therapies that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved over the past decade for treatment of patients with cancer. Destruction of PD-L1 expressing tumors and immune cells is also expected to be a tolerable strategy for patients, with immune-related adverse events anticipated to occur in a manner similar to the approved checkpoint inhibitors. PD-L1 expression is not ubiquitously found in the tumors of cancer patients, but it does not typically reduce over time in those where it is found and it appears to increase in response to other cancer therapies such as cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Molecular chose targeting of PD-L1 because of its relationship to modifying immune surveillance of tumors, its limited normal tissue expression, the known and manageable toxicity profile associated with checkpoint inhibition, and the persistence of PD-L1 expression even after prior treatment failure. Molecular used a similar rationale in the selection of Molecular’s current pipeline, including ETBs targeting TROP-2, TIGIT, and BCMA, which are targets central to disease outcome that persist after a given modality has failed. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Molecular’s ETB platform allows Molecular to identify ETBs to target and select patients in the Phase I clinical trials that phenotypically match that ETB program. Molecular can screen a library of single chain variable fragments, or scFvs, expressed in Molecular’s ETB scaffold to a given target. The pharmacokinetic profile of these compounds is similar and relatively predictive in humans based on animal models. Once the lead is selected and Investigational New Drug Application, or IND-enabling studies are completed, Molecular can enrich a Phase I clinical trial with only patients expressing the target of the ETB. In these Phase I clinical trials, Molecular can get a faster read on the candidate’s safety as well as efficacy than is possible in many drug development programs.

Molecular’s Strategy 
 Molecular’s goal is to bring the right ETBs to the right patients to provide long-lasting benefits that ultimately improve patients’ lives. To achieve its goal, Molecular is: 

• | Implementing development strategies that capitalize on the differentiated pharmacological features of Molecular’s ETB technology and the validated nature of the targets it has chosen. Molecular believes the target specificity of its ETBs, their ability to self-internalize, their potent and differentiated mechanism of cell kill and their safety profiles will provide opportunities for the clinical development of these agents to address multiple cancer types. For example, Molecular is developing MT-6402 as a single agent therapy for relapsed and refractory solid tumors that express PD-L1 on the tumor or on immune cells in the TME. The targeting of this checkpoint has been demonstrated to confer clinical benefit in a wide variety of settings. MT-6402’s differentiated mechanism of action, safety, and pharmacological profile targeting PD-L1 may provide an advantage over other modalities. Given the unique mechanism of direct cell kill via ribosome inactivation and by sensitizing cytotoxic T lymphocytes to these PD-L1 cells by forcing expression of the pp65 CMV antigen, Molecular believes there is the potential for combination drug strategies, particularly with PD-1 inhibitors. Further, based on the safety data seen to date with ETB’s, Molecular believes the different PK profiles of its ETBs may allow them to be more appropriate therapies for certain patient populations, particularly those who are unable to tolerate intensive chemotherapy as primary therapy. Molecular believes all of these attributes will enable Molecular to pursue development strategies not feasible with other therapeutic approaches.

• | Efficiently building a broad pipeline of ETB therapeutics targeting defined patient populations through the use of Molecular’s research and design platform. Molecular believes its research and design platform is an efficient and productive discovery and development engine that can identify new targets across multiple cell types with the aim of creating a portfolio of novel, cell targeting ETBs. By selecting tumor targets best suited to ETB biology, Molecular can prioritize indications, including potential niche indications and/or niche subsets of indications. Molecular believes this will enable the identification of patients who may be more likely to respond to its therapies, allowing Molecular to potentially shorten development timelines and lower associated costs.

• | Maximizing the value of Molecular’s early pipeline through the continual improvement of Molecular’s technology. Since its founding, Molecular has made substantial progress in improving its ETB technology. Molecular has created a proprietary SLTA that has been heavily modified to dramatically reduce innate and adaptive immunogenicity and is utilized in Molecular’s clinical-stage ETBs. In addition, new approaches have been developed for the genetic fusion of the SLTA and antibody domain that enhance the potency of Molecular’s ETBs. Molecular has also developed ETBs like MT-6402 that have the ability to deliver foreign class I antigens into target cells for expression in complex with MHC class I molecules on the target cell’s surface. Molecular has shown preclinically that certain foreign antigens can be functionally recognized by endogenous human T-cells thereby enabling a potentially new and differentiated approach to immuno-oncology.

• | Building a fully integrated discovery-to-commercial biopharmaceutical company focused on compounds with unique and differentiated biology. Molecular believes that differentiated mechanisms of action are crucial for improving outcomes in cancer and other serious diseases. Molecular has created a robust translational platform that Molecular believes allows it to create a sustainable, novel pipeline of ETBs with differentiated mechanisms of tumor destruction, relatively predictable PK, and scalable and economical manufacturing. If MT-6402, MT-5111, MT-0169 or any future drug candidates Molecular may develop are approved, Molecular will consider commercializing them itself in select markets.

Molecular’s Engineered Toxin Body (ETB) Platform Technology 
 Although chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for most cancers, the advent of new and targeted classes of therapies has dramatically changed outcomes in the treatment of disease. The advent of monoclonal antibodies, signal transduction inhibitors and, most recently, immune-oncologics have provided substantial clinical benefit in both the relapsed and refractory setting and, when used in combinations, in earlier lines of therapy. Molecular believes that ETBs represent a new class of targeted agents with differentiated biology that are well-positioned to improve outcomes in cancer patients. 
 ETBs appear to induce the internalization of non- or poorly-internalizing targets, have a differentiated mechanism of action (enzymatic and irreversible ribosome inactivation), have relatively predictable PK profiles and can be readily manufactured to cGMP standards. From a library of antibody targeting domains, Molecular’s research and design platform allows for the comprehensive in vitro selection of a lead ETB to a given target based on affinity and specificity, potency and expression. Lead selection is confirmed through the use of animal models to verify PK, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME), and potency. ETBs possess potent direct cell killing effects via a differentiated mechanism of action, can force receptor internalization, and can be used to deliver payloads such as foreign class I antigen to the cytosol.
 In all clinical-stage ETBs, Molecular utilizes a highly potent and proprietarily de-immunized SLTA scaffold that elicits significantly reduced innate and adaptive immunogenic responses as demonstrated in preclinical and animal studies. For indications where tumors have been demonstrated to be sensitive to T-cell engagement, Molecular has developed ETBs that deliver foreign class I viral antigens for presentation on the surface of the tumor: Molecular’s Antigen Seeding Technology (AST), a differentiated approach to immune-oncology. Molecular has integrated its AST into the PD-L1 targeting ETB, MT-6402, and continues to build out animal models to further validate and screen additional ETB candidates to support this approach.
 Molecular believes that its proprietary ETB technology platform represents a differentiated approach in oncology. ETBs possess the targeting specificity of antibody-based therapeutic approaches but deliver highly potent payloads that disrupt protein synthesis, a fundamental function of a cancer cell, in a manner not subject to traditional chemotherapy resistance mechanisms or target internalization limitations, as with ADCs. Molecular is also seeking to expand the universe of potential targets subject to pharmaceutical treatments by exploiting the ETB’s ability to force internalization against receptors that do not normally internalize. 
 Novel mechanisms of action are needed in oncology treatment, and Molecular believes that its ETB platform technology’s differentiated mechanisms of action may offer unique benefits over existing treatment modalities.

ETB Product Pipeline 
 Molecular is developing a pipeline of ETBs that Molecular believes will have the ability to provide a meaningful and long-lasting benefit to cancer patients. Molecular plans to develop each of these as single agents and/or in combination with other therapies, as applicable. The following table depicts Molecular’s current pipeline: 

MT-6402 – ETB Targeting PD-L1 
 Overview
 PD-L1 is a focal point for immuno-oncology checkpoint antibodies; its expression on tumors is known to downregulate CD8 T-cell activity against tumor cells. In Molecular’s ETB program targeting the PD-L1 receptor, Molecular has focused on targeting PD-L1 with a direct cell kill approach rather than using it to induce an immune response. In addition, Molecular has integrated its Antigen Seeding Technology to the PD-L1 targeting ETB in order to induce targeted tumors to express CMV antigen in complex with MHC-I on the tumor cell surface thereby redirecting an endogenous CMV-specific T-cell response to the tumor.  Molecular believes that targeting PD-L1 expressing tumors via this dual mechanism of ribosome-inactivation and redirected immunity via CMV-specific T-cell response represents a novel mechanism of action against PD-L1 expressing tumors.
 MT-6402 is an ETB consisting of a single chain variable fragment (scFv) with affinity for PD-L1, fused to the enzymatically active de-immunized Shiga-like toxin-A subunit (SLTA) and a class I antigen derived from the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) pp65 protein. MT-6402 was designed to induce potent anti-tumor effects via PD-L1 targeting through multiple mechanisms that may overcome the limitations of approved checkpoint inhibitors. In preclinical studies, MT-6402 specifically binds and kills both tumor and immune PD-L1 expressing cells in a manner consistent with SLTA mediated cellular cytotoxicity through ribosomal inactivation, independent of checkpoint inhibition. Additionally, MT-6402 alters the immunophenotype of targeted cells by delivering foreign class I antigen from CMV for presentation in complex with MHC class I, which may provoke a CMV-specific immune response against the targeted cells. Third, MT-6402 may rehabilitate the TME and allow for immune recognition of tumors by destroying PD-L1-expressing immune cells in the TME through ribosomal inactivation.
 Molecular filed an IND for MT-6402 in December 2020 and the IND was accepted in January 2021. A Phase 1 study of MT-6402 in PD-1/PD-L1 antibody relapsed/refractory patients began in July 2021. The Phase 1 study for MT-6402 is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion trial in the United States and had a starting dose of 16.0 μg/kg. Patients with confirmed PD-L1 expressing tumors or confirmed PD-L1 expression in the TME are eligible for enrollment. Following a review of the safety data from cohort 2 (24.0 μg/kg), patient enrollment in cohort 3 initiated at a dose of 32.0 μg/kg.   Following determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), expansion cohorts are planned to evaluate MT-6402 as a monotherapy in tumor-specific and PD-L1 positive basket tumor cohorts. 
 As of March 2022, 12 patients have been treated across two dose escalation cohorts of 16.0 μg/kg and 24.0 μg/kg in the MT-6402 study of patients with relapsed/refractory tumors that express PD-L1.  Six patients remain on study with five patients awaiting their first efficacy assessment. Regarding safety, no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in the six patients treated in the first cohort of 16.0 μg/kg and one DLT of grade 3 dermatitis was observed in one patient in the second cohort at 24.0 μg/kg.  This patient had development of a grade 3 dermatitis of two days duration which began rapidly, 6 days 
 8

after cycle 1, dose 1.  The patient was treated with systemic steroids and treatment with MT-6402 was held until cycle 2, dose 1, whereupon the patient was re-challenged at the same dose without development of recurrent dermatitis.  Molecular continues to observe pharmacodynamic (PD) effects including monocyte depletion and T cell activation, potentially in a dose-dependent manner.  Regarding efficacy, one patient in cohort 1 with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) had evaluable-only multiple sites of bone disease that appeared to have resolved on bone scan with only one remaining site which showed decreased uptake. This patient remained on MT-6402 up to cycle 8 when increased uptake was noted on bone scan and MT-6402 treatment was discontinued.  
 In November 2021, MT-6402 was granted Fast Track Designation for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC expressing PD-L1. For MT-6402, dose escalation in the Phase 1 study continues as planned. 
 
MT-5111—ETB Targeting HER2
 Overview
 Molecular has launched additional programs against the key target HER2, which was selected because of its validated role in breast and gastric cancer. Targeting HER2 with different modalities (antibody, small molecule and ADC) has shown clinical benefit, and the target is known to persist after a given modality has failed. The clinical results seen with Kadcyla and Enhertu (ADCs to HER2) strongly suggest that a direct cell kill approach to HER2 can provide significant benefit and be well tolerated in patients. Molecular believes that attacking HER2-expressing tumor cells with a differentiated mechanism of destruction may provide meaningful clinical benefits, even in patients whose disease has progressed on other HER2-targeted modalities. Molecular’s lead HER2 ETB, MT-5111, has shown potent picomolar activity in Kadcyla insensitive HER2+ cell lines and has shown additive or synergistic benefit with Kadcyla in vitro in HER2+ cell lines. 
 Molecular filed an IND for MT-5111, its ETB targeting HER2, in March 2019 and the IND was accepted in April 2019. Molecular began dosing study subjects in a Phase I study of MT-5111 for the treatment of HER2-positive cancers in the fourth quarter of 2019. The ongoing Phase I study has two parts: Part 1 is dose escalation and Part 2 is dose expansion, which will begin when a MTD is established in Part 1. Molecular most recently provided an update on this study in January 2022. All of the following information on the Phase I study for MT-5111 was as of that update. 30 patients, with a median of 4 prior lines of therapy and a median of 2 prior HER2-targeting regimens, have been treated with MT-5111; patients with breast cancer received a median of 5.5 prior lines of therapy, 4 of which contained HER2- targeting agents (metastatic breast cancer n=11, metastatic biliary tract carcinoma n=6, metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal n=4, metastatic colorectal cancer n=3, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer n=3, metastatic pancreatic cancer n=2, and metastatic uterine cancer n=1). Eight cohorts (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5, 6.75, 10.0, and 13.0 μg/kg/week) have been successfully completed and enrollment for the ninth cohort (17.0 μg/kg) has been initiated. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data confirm the predicted human PK based on non-human primate studies. PK modeling has suggested that doses equal to or greater than 10.0 μg/kg are likely needed for efficacy. To date, Molecular has not observed any cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) (any grade) or significant cardiotoxicity in human subjects who have been dosed with MT-5111.
 As of Molecular’s January 2022 update, two patients experienced grade 1 troponin elevations without any corresponding symptoms, EKG changes, deterioration in cardiac function on echocardiogram, or other clinical manifestations of cardiac toxicity.  No grade 4 or 5 AEs were reported.  No DLTs were observed. One patient with metastatic breast cancer in cohort 2 (1.0 µg/kg) remained on treatment for 10 cycles with stable disease; although the patient had unmeasurable disease by RECIST criteria, the patient had three sub-centimeter hepatic lesions that disappeared at the end of cycle 8 before the patient discontinued at cycle 10. This patient had received three prior HER-2 targeting regimens which initially included pertuzumab plus trastuzumab followed by trastuzumab and TDM1 as monotherapies. The HER2-positive breast cancer expansion cohort initiated in November 2021 at a dose of 10.0 μg/kg. Dose escalation will continue to determine the MTD, while the breast cancer expansion cohort collects efficacy and safety data.
 Molecular is encouraged by the safety profile to date in these heavily pretreated subjects and believes the observed PK in patients suggests potentially clinically active dose levels.
MT-0169—ETB Targeting CD38 
 Overview 
 CD38 is a single-chain type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed by a variety of hematologic cells in an activation- and differentiation-dependent manner. Its cellular functions are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. CD38 is expressed at high rates on patient myeloma samples, making it an important marker and potential target in the development of targeted biologics. 
 Daratumumab (trade name Darzalex®), an anti-cancer drug originally developed by Genmab, received FDA approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 2015. Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds CD38 on multiple myeloma cells and induces cell death indirectly. Approval was supported by a Phase II pivotal trial in fourth line myeloma patients and subsequent randomized studies in earlier lines of myeloma therapy. A careful analysis of this study’s results reveals that CD38 expression persists after patients have progressed on daratumumab and that the myeloma cells of patients who relapsed after daratumumab treatment showed an increase in cell surface receptors (CD55 and CD59) that inhibit 
 9

daratumumab’s ability to recruit an immune response to the myeloma cells (Nijhof et al., 2016). Persistence of a surface marker that is central to disease strongly suggests that a different modality targeting that surface marker and that is not cross-resistant to antibody therapy may provide substantial clinical benefit in myeloma. 
 Despite cell specific expression, an ADC approach to CD38 has not been developed, likely because CD38 does not efficiently internalize, thereby limiting the amount of drug that could be delivered to myeloma cells. Because SLTA can force its own internalization and enzymatically inhibit ribosome function thereby killing the cell, Molecular theorized that the engineering of a potent and specific ETB targeted to CD38 could overcome the lack of internalization seen with CD38. 
 Molecular was developing MT-4019, an ETB that specifically targets CD38. Upon signing the Development Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement, dated September 18, 2018, as amended (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) in September 2018, TAK-169, now known as MT-0169, an ETB that was jointly discovered with Takeda, became the lead CD38 ETB. The compound was evaluated in many of the same preclinical assays as daratumumab. The mechanism of action of MT-0169 is wholly different than daratumumab, and Molecular believes that MT-0169 may be active in CD38+ myeloma patients that have failed treatment with an anti-CD38 antibody. 
 The proposed development plan for MT-0169 is modeled on that of daratumumab. After a robust response rate in its Phase I trial, daratumumab was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and its expanded Phase II trial (N=106) was considered sufficient for registration. If similar efficacy is seen with MT-0169, Molecular believes it may be possible to pursue a similar accelerated approval strategy via a Phase II clinical trial.    
 In 2019, Molecular and its partner Takeda presented preclinical data on MT-0169 at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting, the IND for MT-0169 was accepted by the FDA in June 2019, and Takeda initiated a Phase 1 study in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in the fourth quarter of 2019. In December 2019, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to MT-0169 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Phase I dosing for MT-0169 began in the first quarter of 2020, was paused in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was re-initiated during the fourth quarter of 2020. 
 In April 2021, Molecular received a notice of termination from Takeda for the Collaboration Agreement. Following receipt of the termination notice from Takeda, Molecular notified Takeda of its intent to assume full rights to MT-0169, by entering into an agreement for such rights pursuant to the termination provisions of the Collaboration Agreement. In August 2021, Molecular assumed full rights to MT-0169, including full control of MT-0169 clinical development, per the terms of the terminated Collaboration Agreement. Following the transfer of the full MT-0169 rights to Molecular, Molecular will owe low-single digit royalties on future net sales of MT-0169 to Takeda as well as to certain third-party licensors. Molecular will also owe certain third-party licensors potential aggregate clinical and regulatory milestone payments of up to $22.25 million. 
 Upon approval of a revised protocol, Molecular will continue to conduct the ongoing Phase 1 study for MT-0169 in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma with dose escalation planned through six dose cohorts, in which the first patient was dosed in February 2020. Patient enrollment in the 50 μg/kg cohort in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma originally resumed following the transfer of the IND to Molecular in August 2021. As of Molecular’s November 2021 update, five multiple myeloma patients have been treated to date, with CD38+ NHL patients to be dosed in addition to myeloma patients as part of a protocol amendment. Two cardiac adverse events were observed that meet criteria for DLTs. Both evaluations were triggered by asymptomatic elevations in high-sensitivity troponin values. As previously disclosed, the first DLT was an asymptomatic, rapidly reversible episode of myocarditis that did not require treatment. The second DLT was an asymptomatic, reversible non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Molecular believes both DLTs may be due to activity against low CD38-expressing cells in the cardiac endothelium. Molecular has not seen evidence of any clinically relevant cardiac adverse event such as myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in any other ETB program (MT-3724, MT-6402, MT-5111) at any dose.
 A more rapid and complete elimination of CD38+ NK cells (a known PD marker for CD38-targeting therapeutics) was observed in the first five patients than had been predicted from in vitro and in vivo models, suggesting that the starting dose of 50 mcg/kg is higher than required. 
 A revised protocol was submitted to explore a lower dose of MT-0169 to reduce the risk of adverse events observed at the initial dose and to enable patients to continue MT-0169 therapy for a longer duration that may drive tumor benefit. 
 We expect to provide periodic updates on MT-6402, MT-5111, and MT-0169 throughout 2022.
 ETB Pipeline 
 We continue to advance our pipeline of next-generation ETBs targeting CTLA-4, TIGIT, TROP2, BCMA, SLAMF-7, and CD45.

ETB Research & Development Partnerships 
 Previous Agreements 
 On September 18, 2018, Molecular entered into a Development Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement, as amended (the “Takeda Development and License Agreement”) with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) for the development and commercialization of products incorporating or comprised of one or more CD38 SLT-A fusion proteins (“Licensed Products”) for the treatment of patients with diseases such as multiple myeloma. 
 In April 2021, Molecular received a notice of termination from Takeda for the Takeda Development and License Agreement. Following receipt of the termination notice from Takeda, Molecular notified Takeda of its intent to assume full rights to MT-0169, a second-generation ETB targeting CD38, by entering into an agreement for such rights pursuant to the termination provisions of the Takeda Development and License Agreement. The termination of the Takeda Development and License Agreement was effective in August 2021. As of the same date, Molecular assumed full rights to MT-0169, including full control of MT-0169 clinical development, per the terms of the terminated Takeda Development and License Agreement. Following the transfer of the full MT-0169 rights to Molecular, Molecular will owe low-single digit royalties on future net sales of MT-0169 to Takeda as well as to certain third-party licensors. Molecular will also owe certain third-party licensors potential aggregate clinical and regulatory milestone payments of up to $22.25 million.
 On November 18, 2019, Molecular entered into a Master Collaboration Agreement (“Vertex Collaboration Agreement”) with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (“Vertex”), in which the parties agreed to enter into a strategic research collaboration to leverage Molecular’s ETB technology platform to discover and develop novel targeted biologic therapies for applications outside of oncology. In October 2021, Molecular received a notice of termination from Vertex for the Vertex Collaboration Agreement. The termination of the Vertex Collaboration Agreement was effective October 29, 2021. There are no ongoing activities or economic obligations in connection with the Vertex Collaboration Agreement.
 In June 2017, Molecular entered into a Multi-Target Collaboration and License Agreement with Takeda (the “Takeda Multi-Target Agreement”), pursuant to which Molecular agreed to collaborate with Takeda to identify, generate and evaluate ETBs, against certain targets designated by Takeda. In March 2022, following Molecular’s request to bring the agreement to an end, Molecular and Takeda mutually agreed to terminate the Takeda Multi-Target Agreement. As a result of the termination, Molecular regained full rights to pursue the targets worked on under the Takeda Multi-Target Agreement. There are no ongoing activities or economic obligations in connection with the Takeda Multi-Target Agreement.
 
Bristol Myers Squibb Company
 On February 10, 2021, Molecular entered into a Collaboration Agreement (the “BMS Collaboration Agreement”) with Bristol Myers Squibb Company (“Bristol Myers Squibb”), pursuant to which the parties agreed to enter into a strategic research collaboration to leverage the Company’s ETB technology platform to discover and develop novel products containing ETBs directed to multiple targets.
 Pursuant to the terms of the BMS Collaboration Agreement, Molecular granted Bristol Myers Squibb a series of exclusive options to obtain one or more exclusive licenses under Molecular’s intellectual property to exploit products containing ETBs directed against certain targets designated by Bristol Myers Squibb.
 Pursuant to the BMS Collaboration Agreement, Bristol Myers Squibb paid Molecular an upfront payment of $70 million. In addition to the upfront payment, Molecular may receive near term and development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $874.5 million. Molecular will also be eligible to receive up to an additional $450 million in payments upon the achievement of certain sales milestones, and subject to certain reductions, tiered royalties ranging from mid-single digits up to mid-teens as percentages of calendar year net sales, if any, on any licensed product.
 Molecular will be responsible for conducting the research activities through the designation, if any, of one or more development candidates. Upon the exercise of its option for a development candidate, Bristol Myers Squibb will be responsible for all development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization activities with respect to that development candidate, subject to the terms and conditions of the BMS Collaboration Agreement.
 Unless earlier terminated, the BMS Collaboration Agreement will expire (i) on a country-by-country basis and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, on the date of expiration of the royalty payment obligations under the BMS Collaboration Agreement with respect to such licensed product in such country and (ii) in its entirety upon the earlier of (a) the expiration of the royalty payment obligations under the BMS Collaboration Agreement with respect to all licensed products in all countries or (b) upon Bristol Myers Squibb’s decision not to exercise any option on or prior to the applicable option deadlines. Bristol Myers Squibb has the right to terminate the BMS Collaboration Agreement for convenience upon prior written notice to Molecular. Either party has the right to terminate the BMS Collaboration Agreement (a) for the insolvency of the other party or (b) subject to specified cure periods, in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach.

 11

Other Research & Development Collaborations 
 Henry M. Jackson Foundation 
 In July 2014, Molecular entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for certain biological materials for use in conjunction with the development of Molecular’s then lead clinical stage ETB MT-3724. Under the terms of the agreement, Molecular is required to pay the Henry M. Jackson Foundation aggregate payments totaling $110,000 with respect to this license, upon completion of certain clinical milestones. Molecular may terminate this agreement at any time with 45 days prior written notice.
CPRIT Grant 
 On September 18, 2018, Molecular entered into a Cancer Research Grant Contract (the “CD38 CPRIT Agreement”) with the Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT), which was extended in October 2021, in connection with a grant of approximately $15.2 million awarded by CPRIT to Molecular in November 2016 to fund research of a cancer therapy involving an ETB that is targeting CD38 (the “Award”). Pursuant to the CD38 CPRIT Agreement, Molecular may also use such funds to develop a replacement CD38 targeting ETB, with or without a partner. The Award is contingent upon funds being available during the term of the CD38 CPRIT Agreement and subject to CPRIT’s ability to perform its obligations under the CD38 CPRIT Agreement as well as Molecular’s progress towards achievement of specified milestones, among other contractual requirements. In December 2011, Private Molecular (defined below) was awarded a $10.6 million product development grant from CPRIT for its CD20-targeting ETB MT-3724. This product development grant ended in November 2019.
 Subject to the terms of the CD38 CPRIT Agreement, full ownership of any CPRIT funded technology and CPRIT funded intellectual property rights developed pursuant to the CD38 CPRIT Agreement will be retained by Molecular, its Collaborators (as defined in the CD38 CPRIT Agreement) and, to the extent applicable, any participating third party (the “Project Results”). With respect to any Project Results, Molecular agreed to grant to CPRIT a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license, solely for academic, research and other non-commercial purposes, under the Project Results and to exploit any necessary additional intellectual property rights, subject to certain exclusions.
 Molecular will pay to CPRIT, during the term of the CD38 CPRIT Agreement, certain payments equal to a percentage of revenue ranging from the low- to mid-single digits. These payments will continue up to and until CPRIT receives an aggregate amount of 400% of the sum of all monies paid to it by CPRIT under the CD38 CPRIT Agreement. If Molecular is required to obtain a license from a third party to sell any such product, the revenue sharing percentages may be reduced. In addition, once Molecular pays CPRIT 400% of the monies it has received under the CD38 CPRIT Agreement, Molecular will continue to pay CPRIT a revenue-sharing percentage of 0.5%.
 The CD38 CPRIT Agreement will terminate, with certain obligations extending beyond termination, on the earlier of (a) May 31, 2022 or (b) the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) by mutual written consent of the parties, (ii) by CPRIT for an Event of Default (as defined in the CD38 CPRIT Agreement) by Molecular, (iii) by CPRIT if allocated funds should become legally unavailable during the term of the CD38 CPRIT Agreement and CPRIT is unable to obtain additional funds or (iv) by Molecular for convenience. CPRIT may approve a no cost extension for the CD38 CPRIT Agreement for a period not to exceed six months after the termination date if additional time is required to ensure adequate completion of the approved project, subject to the terms and conditions of the CD38 CPRIT Agreement. 
 Manufacturing
 Molecular has built a cGMP manufacturing facility located in Austin, TX to supply future clinical trial materials for internal and partnered ETB programs. Molecular relies in part on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture and supply Molecular with cGMP drug substance and drug product materials to support Molecular’s clinical trials. The manufacturing processes for MT-6402, MT-5111, MT-0169 and the preclinical ETB candidates have been developed by Molecular’s biopharmaceutical development and manufacturing staff. Once a process is developed and defined for an ETB, it may be transferred to CMOs to scale-up and optimize for manufacturing that conforms to cGMP standards. 
 Molecular has established well-defined, cost efficient manufacturing under cGMP regulations, including bioanalytical, quality control and quality assurance, logistics, distribution and supply chain management. After manufacturing, Molecular’s ETB candidates are tested and released by Molecular’s analytical and quality systems staff in conjunction with some select contract research organizations, or CROs. The quality control organization performs a series of release assays designed to ensure that the product meets all applicable specifications. Molecular’s quality assurance staff also reviews manufacturing and quality control records prior to batch release in an effort to assure conformance with cGMP as mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies. 
 12

Molecular’s manufacturing staff is trained and routinely evaluated for conformance to rigorous manufacturing procedures and quality standards. This oversight is intended to ensure compliance with FDA and foreign regulations and to provide consistent ETB output. Molecular’s quality control and quality assurance staff are similarly trained and evaluated as part of Molecular’s effort to ensure consistency in the testing and release of the product, as well as consistency in materials, equipment and facilities. 
 For the purposes of internal research and support for Molecular’s ongoing collaborations, Molecular has small scale manufacturing capabilities that are sufficient to manufacture drug materials for preclinical and early phase clinical research.
 As part of its manufacturing process, Molecular endeavors to utilize cGMP grade materials and reagents, if commercially available; however, certain critical materials and reagents are currently qualified for research use only. Additionally, Molecular obtains key components required for the manufacture of its investigational products from third-party manufacturers and suppliers, which include, in some instances, sole source manufacturers and suppliers. Molecular does not currently have long-term commitments or supply agreements in place to obtain certain key components used in the manufacture of its drug candidates.
 Intellectual Property Portfolio
 Molecular seeks to protect proprietary rights in its platform technologies through a combination of patents and patent applications, trade secrets and know-how. Molecular’s platform technologies include ETBs, in which a Shiga toxin A subunit construct is associated, directly or indirectly, to immunoglobulin domains directed to the molecular target, resulting in ETBs for treating cancer, killing cancer cells and selectively delivering payload molecules into target cells. While each ETB targets at least one specific molecular target, many of Molecular’s platform technologies are target agnostic. Molecular’s platform technologies include the Shiga toxin components of ETBs, including improved Shiga toxin A subunit constructs engineered to have reduced innate and adaptive immunogenicity, including by disrupting of B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes.
 Molecular has 12 patent families that cover its proprietary platform technologies, together covering over 284 patents and pending U.S. and foreign applications worldwide, including over 46 granted U.S. and foreign patents and over 91 pending patent applications in the U.S., Europe and in thirteen other jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and Europe (such as, e.g., Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Mexico, and South Korea).  Patents have been granted from eight of these patent families, including in Australia, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the U.S. 
 Molecular has 13 patent families covering ETBs in its ETB pipeline, including ETBs which target PD-L1, HER2, and CD38.  These 13 patent families include over 100 patents and pending U.S and foreign applications worldwide, including over 30 granted U.S. and foreign patents and over 45 pending patent applications in the U.S., Europe, and in thirteen other jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and Europe (such as, e.g., Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Mexico, and South Korea).  Patents have been granted from six of these patent families, including in Australia, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the U.S.  In certain circumstances, Molecular’s patents may be eligible for adjustment of patent term due to patent office delay, or extension of patent term to compensate for loss of patent term during drug development and regulatory review. The expected expiration dates referenced above do not include these adjustments or extensions. 
 As of December 31, 2021, Molecular owned 19 U.S. and foreign patents relating to hypoxia-activated prodrugs. These U.S. and foreign patents are expected to expire from 2025 to 2031 (in each case, if all relevant maintenance fees or annuities are paid, and without accounting for any patent term extension).
 
Impact of COVID-19
 In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. It has impacted, and is continuing to impact, all aspects of society, including the operation of the healthcare system and other business and economic activity worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic, and other similar outbreaks of contagious diseases, may adversely impact Molecular’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, Molecular and the third-party clinical trial sites or investigators involved in its current and future clinical trials may experience significant interruptions or delays as a result of this pandemic, and these could impact the conduct of Molecular’s clinical trials and its ability to complete them in a timely manner or at all, which in turn could delay and/or negatively impact the regulatory review and approval of Molecular’s drug or biologic candidates.
 Molecular is carefully and continually evaluating the potential individual patient risk associated with continuing to enroll in its existing clinical studies during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in accordance with FDA and foreign regulatory authorities’ recommendations for clinical trials. Molecular’s Phase 1 studies for MT-6402 and MT-5111 are open and able to treat enrolled subjects and screen new subjects. A revised protocol was submitted to explore a lower dose of MT-0169 to reduce the risk of adverse events observed at the initial dose and to enable patients to continue MT-0169 therapy for a longer duration that may drive tumor benefit. 
 The decision to continue Molecular’s ongoing studies throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was predicated on the treating investigator determining that the potential benefit to the patient of investigational therapy outweighs the potential risk 
 13

of contracting COVID-19 as the subjects enrolled in Molecular’s trials had relapsed or refractory incurable malignancies with few or no standard-of-care therapeutic options and limited life expectancy.
 Overall, COVID-19 led to a significant slowdown in the pace of site initiations and patient enrollment into Molecular’s clinical trials. The degree of disruption was, and continues to be, variable by geography and individual clinical site. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant slowdown in the pace of site initiations and patient enrollment across the MT-0169 program, which had a temporary pause in the activation of new study sites and new patient enrollment (along with most of Takeda’s other early-stage studies) due to COVID-19 and was reinitiated in the fourth quarter of 2020. To date, screening and enrollment for the MT-5111 Phase I study, which remained open throughout the pandemic, has been less adversely affected than the MT-0169 study was during 2020 and throughout 2021, prior to the submission of a revised protocol. Molecular’s Phase 1 study of MT-6402 began in July 2021. To date, Molecular has been able to continue to work at our cGMP manufacturing facility and laboratories without significant interruption from COVID-19. As a result, manufacturing of product supply for clinical trials and research activities to support advancement of Molecular’s preclinical pipeline (including partnered programs) have not been adversely affected by COVID-19 to date.
 The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact Molecular’s business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on the manner in which this pandemic continues to evolve and future developments in response thereto, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence and which may include, among other things, the ultimate severity, intensity and duration of this pandemic (including any resurgences); impact of the new COVID-19 variants, the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines; governmental, business or other actions that have been, or will be, taken in response to this pandemic, including restrictions on travel and mobility, business closures and imposition of social distancing measures; impacts of the pandemic on the vendors or distribution channels in Molecular’s or its partners’ supply chain and ability to continue to manufacture its investigational products; impacts of the pandemic on the conduct of Molecular’s clinical trials, including with respect to enrollment rates, availability of investigators and clinical trial sites or monitoring of data; and impacts of the pandemic on the regulatory agencies with which Molecular interacts in the development, review, approval and commercialization of its therapeutic products.
 
Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as MT-6402, MT-5111, MT-0169 and any future drug candidates. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on Molecular. 
 MT-6402, MT-5111, MT-0169 and any ETB drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a New Drug Application, or NDA, or Biologics License Application, BLA, before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
  
• | Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee covering each clinical trial site before a trial may be initiated at that site;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice requirements, or GCP, and other clinical trial-related requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14

 
• | Submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA for marketing approval, including payment of application user fees;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA that the NDA or BLA is sufficiently complete to permit a substantial review, in which case the NDA or BLA is filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of an FDA advisory committee, if one was involved, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The preclinical testing, clinical trials and the approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and Molecular cannot be certain that any approvals for MT-6402, MT-5111, MT-0169 and any future drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. The data required to support an NDA or BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the molecule’s toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB on behalf of each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 
Preclinical Studies and IND
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for the investigational product’s therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of effects on reproduction and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions and places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.

Clinical trials
 Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase I, Phase II and Phase III, which may overlap.
  
• | Phase I clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the drug candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15

 
• | Phase II clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the investigational drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 In addition, an IRB on behalf of each institution that is participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to clinical trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials, including details of the protocol and eventually study results, also must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov data registry. Information related to the investigational product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. The NIH’s Final Rule on ClinicalTrials.gov registration and reporting requirements became effective in 2017, and the government has recently begun enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.
 Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. 
 During the development of a new drug or biologic, sponsors have the opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II, and before submission of an NDA or BLA. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase II meeting to discuss their Phase II clinical results with the agency and to present their plans for the pivotal Phase III studies that they believe will support approval of the new drug or biologic. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may perform additional animal studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final drug or biologic. For biologics in particular, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined in order to help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that MT-6402, MT-5111, MT-0169 and any future drug candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their respective labeled shelf lives.
 
NDA/BLA Submission and FDA Review Process
 Following completion of the clinical trials, all of the data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for its proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for 
 16

one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity, potency and efficacy for a biologic. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators or company-sponsored expanded access programs. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes annual prescription drug product program fees and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs and biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business (fewer than 500 employees). Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. The fee for the submission of an NDA or BLA for which clinical data is required is substantial (for example, for fiscal year 2022 this application fee exceeds $3.1 million), and the annual program fee assessed on each sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is currently more than $369,000 per program. 
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may refuse to file the application and request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt and inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its review of a new molecular-entity (NME) NDA or an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an NME NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. For non-NME NDAs, the review goals are ten months from the date of receipt for a standard application and six months from the date of receipt for a priority submission. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. As noted above, the FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs and BLAs. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements by each of the entities involved in the clinical trials, including clinical investigators and any third-party clinical research organizations (“CROs”). 
 Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other independent scientific experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making final agency decisions on marketing approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or “REMS” plan, if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the drug or biologic. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve an NDA or BLA without a REMS, if one is required.
 The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA or BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s) and/or 
 17

other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may choose either to resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or to withdraw the application. If and when all deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmitted NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to an issued Complete Response Letter in either two or six months, depending on the type of information included. Even if such data and information are submitted, however, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the applicant interprets the same data. If a product receives regulatory approval from the FDA, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the application. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication.
 In December 2019, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to MT-0169 for the treatment of multiple myeloma, which is now held by Molecular following the transfer of full rights to develop MT-0169 to Molecular from Takeda.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
 To be eligible for a fast-track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to an existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the NDA or BLA for a fast-track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA. In addition, fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast-track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting.
 In November 2021, the FDA granted fast-track designation to MT-6402 for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) expressing PD-L1.
 The FDA also may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug or biologic that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. When a marketing application is submitted with a request for priority review, the FDA determines on a case-by-case basis whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. 
 18

Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months for an original BLA or an NME NDA from the date of filing (or from ten months to six months from the date of receipt for a non-NME NDA). 
 Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The FDA must take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing advice to the product sponsor, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Fast track designation, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 
Accelerated Approval Pathway
 Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval from the FDA and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug or biologic when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. Drugs and biologics granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate long-term clinical benefit of a drug.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase IV or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug or biologic. All promotional materials for products approved for marketing under the accelerated approval program are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 
Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, amendments to the FDCA, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The 
 19

Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, made permanent PREA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase II meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase III or Phase II/III study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
 
Post-marketing Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting approved drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”). Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Prescription drug promotional materials also must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials.
 The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS plan to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our drug candidates must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities before any product is approved and commercial products can be manufactured or distributed. Molecular relies in part, and expects to continue to rely in part, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of Molecular’s products in accordance with cGMPs. These manufacturers must comply with cGMPs that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, or on the manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including recall or product seizure.
 Once an approval or clearance of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs/BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 20


 
• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Most recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 
Companion Diagnostics and Complementary Diagnostics
 Molecular believes that the success of Molecular’s therapeutic product candidates may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of either a companion diagnostic or complementary diagnostic. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. The level of risk associated with a new diagnostic test combined with available controls to mitigate risk determines whether a companion diagnostic device requires Premarket Approval (PMA) from the FDA or if it can be cleared by the agency through the 510(k) premarket notification process based on a showing of substantial equivalence to a commercially available device. For a novel therapeutic product for which a companion diagnostic device is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and PMA-approved or 510(k)-cleared contemporaneously with the FDA’s approval of the therapeutic product. The use of the companion diagnostic device will be stipulated in the labeling of the therapeutic product.
U.S. Patent-term Extension
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of MT-6402, MT-5111, MT-0169, and any future drug candidates, some of Molecular’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit extension of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term extension, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term extension period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, Molecular may apply for extension of patent term for Molecular’s currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA. 
Marketing Exclusivity for Small-Molecule Drug Products 
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.”
 21

Following approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant submits its application to the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the RLD in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, such an applicant also is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant, and for which the applicant has not received a right of reference. Unlike the ANDA pathway used by developers of bioequivalent versions of innovator drugs, which does not allow applicants to submit new clinical data other than bioavailability or bioequivalence data, the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway does not preclude the possibility that a follow-on applicant would need to conduct additional clinical trials or nonclinical studies; for example, they may be seeking approval to market a previously approved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness.
 
Specifically, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for a follow-on drug product must certify with respect to each patent that:
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval).
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA owner and patent holders once the ANDA in question has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA owner and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 In addition, under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. These market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a drug containing a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 
 The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a traditional NDA filed under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. However, an applicant submitting a traditional NDA would be required to either conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

Reference Product Exclusivity for Biological Products
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States and included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. 
 To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars, including the first interchangeable biosimilars in 2021. The FDA has also issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and approving biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars.
 Biosimilarity requires that the follow-on biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the follow-on product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that its product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical studies to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Upon licensure by the FDA, an interchangeable biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product, although to date no such products have been approved for marketing in the United States. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 A reference biological product is granted twelve years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed. If pediatric studies are performed and accepted by the FDA as responsive to a Written Request, as described further below, the 12-year exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months. In addition, the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA continue to be subject to significant uncertainty.
 
Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA or BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies.
 If granted, pediatric exclusivity attaches to both the twelve-year and four-year exclusivity periods for reference biologics approved pursuant to BLAs, as well as the five-year and three-year marketing exclusivity periods available to NDA sponsors under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period, as may be applicable to the FDA-approved therapeutic product.

Other U.S. Health Care Laws and Regulations
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval may also be subject to regulation by other regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA. Depending on the nature of the product, those authorities may include the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
 For example, in the United States, sales and marketing for prescription biopharmaceutical products must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to ten years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and two of the five criminal healthcare fraud statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these two provisions in the statute or specific intent to violate them; specifically with respect to the prohibition on executing or attempting to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud or to fraudulently obtain money or property of any health care benefit program and the prohibition on disposing of assets to enable a person to become eligible for Medicaid. Moreover, the government may now assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. There also are federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act that require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners and physician ownership and investment interests. Prescription drug and biologic products also must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against Molecular for violation of these laws, even if Molecular successfully defends against it, could cause Molecular to incur significant legal expenses, divert Molecular’s management’s attention from the operation of Molecular’s business and harm Molecular’s reputation. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by Molecular could materially affect Molecular’s business in an adverse way.
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact Molecular’s business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to Molecular’s manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of Molecular’s products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of Molecular’s business.
 
European Union Drug Development
 In the European Union, Molecular’s future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, drugs and biologics, which are referred to collectively in Europe as medicinal products, can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. Whether or not Molecular obtains FDA approval for a drug candidate, Molecular must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before Molecular may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas.
 24

Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, a clinical trial application must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. 
 The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Specifically, in April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted and came into application on January 31, 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
 
European Union Drug Review and Approval
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.

• | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 
European Union New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
 In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new 
 25

therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies.
 
European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The 10-year period of exclusivity may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:
  
• | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.

United Kingdom regulatory framework and operational impacts post-Brexit
 The United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), with a transitional period that expired on December 31, 2020. The United Kingdom and the European Union entered into a trade agreement known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which went into effect on January 1, 2021.  It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom. Molecular is currently evaluating the potential impacts on Molecular’s business of the new Trade and Cooperation Agreement and guidance issued to date by the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) regarding the requirements for licensing and marketing drug and biologics in the United Kingdom.
 Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom.  Such outcomes could make it more difficult and expensive for Molecular to do business in Europe, complicate our clinical, manufacturing and regulatory strategies and impair our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for, and, if approved, commercialize, our products and product candidates in Europe. In addition, our ability to continue to conduct our international operations out of the United Kingdom, where the headquarters for our international operations is located, may be materially and adversely affected. While Molecular has undertaken a number of Brexit-related contingency planning initiatives, the full potential financial, legal, regulatory and other implications of Brexit are uncertain and Molecular cannot make any assurances regarding the extent to which Molecular’s business may be adversely affected thereby.
 
Rest of the World Regulation
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If Molecular fails to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, Molecular may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
26


Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
 Sales of Molecular’s products approved for marketing by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities will depend, in part, on the extent to which Molecular’s products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed care organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of Molecular’s products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require Molecular to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of Molecular’s products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. However, following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the ACA’s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although the new federal administration under President Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the ACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for health insurance subsidies under it. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect the biopharmaceutical industry as a whole or our business in the future.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 cancellation. The suspension was subsequently extended through March 31, 2022, with a reduction of the suspension to 1% sequester through June 30, 2022.
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which Molecular receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for Molecular’s products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices Molecular might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The maximum amount that a manufacturer may charge a 340B covered entity for a given product is the AMP reduced by the rebate amount paid by the manufacturer to Medicaid for each unit of that product. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
 Moreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state 
 27

legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. HHS has solicited feedback on various measures intended to lower drug prices and reduce the out of pocket costs of drugs and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2020, the FDA finalized a rulemaking to establish a system whereby state governmental entities could lawfully import and distribute prescription drugs sourced from Canada. Those new regulations became effective on November 30, 2020, although the impact of such future programs is uncertain, in part because lawsuits have been filed challenging the government’s authority to promulgate them. Congress and the executive branch have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs making this area subject to ongoing uncertainty. 
 As another example, the Biden Administration, which assumed control of the Executive Branch on January 20, 2021, has indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority, and in July 2021, President Biden issued a sweeping executive order on promoting competition in the American economy that includes several mandates pertaining to the pharmaceutical and health care insurance industries. Among other things, the executive order directs the FDA to work towards implementing a system for importing drugs from Canada (following finalization of the Canadian drug importation rulemaking in fall of 2020, as mentioned above). The Biden order also called on HHS to release a comprehensive plan to combat high prescription drug prices, and it includes several directives regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s oversight of potentially anticompetitive practices within the pharmaceutical industry. The drug pricing plan released by HHS in September 2021 in response to the executive order makes clear that the Biden Administration supports aggressive action to address rising drug prices, including allowing HHS to negotiate the cost of Medicare Part B and D drugs, but such significant changes will require either new legislation to be passed by Congress or time-consuming administrative actions. 
 At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers (“PBMs”) and other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area.
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which Molecular receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. Molecular expects that the increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which Molecular receives regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a medicinal product must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a new drug candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessment, or HTA) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of Molecular’s future commercial products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 
Health Care Reform in the U.S. and Potential Changes to Health Care Laws
 The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and devices and to spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is uncertain. In addition, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law, which reauthorized the FDA’s user fee programs and included additional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act. If Molecular is slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if Molecular is not able to maintain regulatory compliance, Molecular may lose any marketing approval that Molecular otherwise may have obtained and Molecular may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 As previously mentioned, the primary trend in the US health care industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other health care funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug 
 28

Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. The uncertainty related to the Affordable Care Act and the regulatory and executive actions pertaining to drug costs and drug pricing matters is described above under “Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement”. As another example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020 incorporated extensive health care provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drugs and biological products covered under Medicare Part B report the product’s average sales price to HHS beginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act that may affect health care expenditures. For example, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 into law (P.L. 116-94) that includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 or the “CREATES Act.” The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic and biosimilar product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic and biosimilar product developers need samples to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic and biosimilar products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic or biosimilar product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on “commercially reasonable, market-based terms.” Whether and how generic and biosimilar product developments will use this new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on our future commercial products are unknown. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 also includes, among other things, a new requirement for patent information to be submitted to the FDA and published in a “Purple Book” that contains detailed information about each FDA-licensed biological product, analogous to the Orange Book that provides information about approved small-molecule drug products and their patent and exclusivity information under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. In addition, the next cycle of Congressional reauthorization for FDA’s prescription drug, biologic, and medical device user fee programs must be completed by mid-2022 and that periodic must-pass legislation is typically used as a vehicle to implement federal policy changes or other substantive amendments to the FDCA.
 Molecular cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. Molecular expects that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services. Moreover, if Molecular is slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if Molecular is not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our drug or biologic candidates may lose any marketing approval that may have been obtained and Molecular may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business. 
 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 In general, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, prohibits offering to pay, paying, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business for or with, or in order to direct business to, any person. The prohibitions apply not only to payments made to “any foreign official,” but also those made to “any foreign political party or official thereof,” to “any candidate for foreign political office” or to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of the payment will be offered, given, or promised to anyone in any of the foregoing categories. “Foreign officials” under the FCPA include officers or employees of a department, agency, or instrumentality of a foreign government. The term “instrumentality” is broad and can include state-owned or state-controlled entities. 
 29

Importantly, United States authorities that enforce the FCPA, including the Department of Justice, deem most health care professionals and other employees of foreign hospitals, clinics, research facilities and medical schools in countries with public health care or public education systems to be “foreign officials” under the FCPA. When Molecular interacts with foreign health care professionals and researchers in testing and marketing our products abroad, Molecular must have policies and procedures in place sufficient to prevent us and agents acting on our behalf from providing any bribe, gift or gratuity, including excessive or lavish meals, travel or entertainment in connection with marketing our products and services or securing required permits and approvals such as those needed to initiate clinical trials in foreign jurisdictions. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the maintenance of books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and the development and maintenance of an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. The SEC is involved with the books and records provisions of the FCPA. 
 
Competition 
 Molecular competes directly with companies that focus on oncology as well as companies dedicating their resources to novel forms of cancer therapies. Molecular also faces competition from academic research institutions, governmental agencies and various other public and private research institutions. With the proliferation of new drugs and therapies into oncology, Molecular expects to face increasingly intense competition as new technologies become available. Any ETB candidates that Molecular successfully develops and commercializes will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of Molecular’s competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than Molecular. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of Molecular’s competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with Molecular in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, Molecular’s programs. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of Molecular’s ETB candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Molecular’s commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if its competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, more convenient or easier to administer, or have fewer or less severe effects than any products that Molecular may develop. Molecular’s competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than Molecular may obtain approval for its products, which could result in Molecular’s competitors establishing a strong market position before Molecular is able to enter the market. Even if Molecular’s ETB candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by then. 
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late-stage clinical development directed to the same biological targets as Molecular’s programs, including antibodies, antibody drug conjugates and bi-specific antibodies. 
  
• | The approved antibody-based products targeting CD38 are daratumumab (Janssen/Genmab) and isatuximab (Sanofi).
