Item 1. Business
Overview
We provide digital outsourced services, focused on serving high-growth technology companies to represent, protect and grow their brands. We serve our clients to support their end customers’ urgent needs, navigate an increasingly-complex compliance landscape, handle sensitive tasks, including online content moderation and enable artificial intelligence technology and automation. As of December 31, 2021, we served over 100 clients spanning numerous industry segments within the Digital Economy, including e-commerce, FinTech, food delivery and ride sharing, gaming, HiTech, HealthTech, social media and streaming media. In 2021, over 99% of our revenues came from recurring revenue contracts, and we achieved a net revenue retention rate of 141%.
Our global, omni-channel delivery model is focused on providing our clients three key services – Digital Customer Experience (“Digital CX”), Content Security and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Operations. Our Digital CX offerings serve the needs of the modern consumer, whose habits have changed in the past decade and revolve around the smartphone. Our Content Security offerings include content monitoring and moderation services, the need for which is increasingly critical to protect the sanctity of the open internet. Our AI Operations offerings include providing high quality, human-annotated data sets and algorithm training services to our clients as they navigate significant increases in the prevalence of disruptive AI technology.
We have a track record of using thesis-led prospecting strategies to identify attractive and emerging industry segments in their infancy, win marquee clients and establish thought leadership and operating best practices. We had a new client win rate of 49% in 2021.
Our delivery model is tailored to meet the needs of high-growth companies. Our cloud-based technology infrastructure is designed to enable clients to set up operations quickly and seamlessly and allows clients to outsource many of their core processes at earlier stages of their company lifecycle. We use data science and process automation to achieve technology-driven efficiency gains. We analyze a significant amount of aggregated data obtained from customer interactions on behalf of our clients. We leverage these insights and end customer-driven feedback to drive workflow efficiencies, deliver insights on predictive behaviors that lead to lower customer churn and help our clients innovate their core product offerings and develop new product features. We use cNPS to measure our client satisfaction. Our 2021 full year cNPS was 64.
We believe that prioritizing and investing in our frontline employees helps us better serve our clients. As we have expanded across the globe, we strive to champion our vision of operational excellence through an employee-centric culture at every site. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 40,100 employees across twenty-three sites in ten countries, including two countries where operations are expected to start in 2022. In 2021, our eNPS was 70, and 78% of our employees who participated rated us 9 or 10 on a scale of 10. In addition, we held a Glassdoor rating of 4.6 out of 5.0 as of December 31, 2021.
On June 11, 2021, our Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). Upon closing the IPO on June 15, 2021, we issued and sold 5,553,154 shares of Class A common stock (the “primary” offering) and certain selling stockholders sold 9,626,846 outstanding shares (the “secondary” offering), including shares sold by the selling stockholders pursuant to the underwriters’ full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $23 per share. We received net proceeds of $120.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering expenses. We used the proceeds from the primary offering, together with cash on hand, to satisfy payments of approximately $127.5 million in respect of vested phantom shares.
Key Industry Trends
As technology and the internet have fundamentally transformed the way consumers seek to engage with their favorite brands, a number of trends have emerged that benefit our clients and increase their demand for our solutions, including:
Rapid growth in the Digital Economy: New and emerging digital trends such as the Internet of Things (“IoT”), cloud computing, mobile web services and AI are changing the business ecosystem and creating new opportunities for economic growth. These companies have leveraged technology and low barriers to entry to disrupt traditional markets and experience rapid growth.
Technology companies are outsourcing at an accelerating pace: As technology companies scale, they must dedicate resources across product development. However, they often lack the physical capacity or desire to develop operational infrastructure internally as they focus on growing their core offerings. As a result, we believe technology companies are increasingly willing to outsource at earlier stages of their lifecycles and are driving outsized growth within the overall outsourcing industry. Additionally, many technology companies have adapted to COVID-19 by allowing employees to work remotely, which we believe has increased these clients comfort with a less structured work environment and resulted in increased outsourcing opportunities. As talent has become increasingly difficult to find in today’s low unemployment and 
strong hiring environment, many technology companies are turning to outsourcers with a core competency in hiring, training and retaining skilled employees.
COVID-19 accelerating outsourcing spend: As businesses are forced to learn how to work remotely, we believe it is becoming less important where employees are physically located or whether they are employed directly or by an outsourced partner.
Alignment of vendor company culture: We believe that vendor company culture is the number one selection criteria when digital economy companies evaluate outsourcing vendors. Companies understand that consumers increasingly want to feel a personal connection to the brands they interact with. This trend accelerates the need for next-generation outsourcers to act as extensions of their clients’ brands so that end customers receive the personal experiences they desire.
Customer experience is a critical retention and growth lever, rather than a cost center: The direct impact of negative experiences on brand affinity coupled with relatively high customer acquisition costs for new economy companies, underscores the importance of active customer retention efforts.
Significant increase in user and advertiser generated content and the need for content moderation: There are over four billion social media users worldwide, leading to unprecedented amounts of user generated content. As a result, social media platforms have attracted billions of advertising dollars from a significant number of advertisers. There are regulatory and reputational risks, as well as billions of dollars of revenue streams at stake, for these platforms if sensitive content is not properly moderated.
Advancement of AI technologies requires large sets of annotated data: AI use cases are growing quickly and the success of AI companies will be determined in large part by the accuracy of their algorithms, which are inextricably linked to the quality of underlying data sets which must be manually annotated by trained experts. We believe that as AI continues to grow, so too will outsourcing opportunities.
Competitive Strengths
We have distinguished ourselves as a leader in next-generation technology-enabled outsourced services by leveraging several competitive strengths, including:
High Growth Technology Is Not a Segment of Our Business, It Is Our Business: We view technology as a macro trend that transcends all industries, whereas we believe most of our competitors view technology as one of their many client verticals. We have been able to develop deep expertise across several sub-verticals that comprise this high growth market, including food delivery, e-commerce, FinTech, HealthTech and social media. We facilitate millions of interactions between our clients and their respective end customers on a daily basis. We leverage insights from this constant flow of activity to better understand the particular challenges and trends in each niche market, which enables us to drive best practices across our client base.
 Digitally Native: As a 13-year-old outsourcer, we were “born on the web and grew up in the cloud,” allowing us to enter the market without investing in legacy infrastructure. We are adept at executing work in digital channels such as chat, native in-app messaging, short message service (“SMS”), and social channels. In 2021, 95% of our revenue was delivered from non-voice, digital channels or omni-channel services, and our technology infrastructure is cloud-based.
Agility and Responsiveness at Scale: We know how to get the job done—quickly. We move swiftly and we think differently. From the pre-contract engagement of our Project Management Organization to our decentralized “Site ‘CEO’ Model,” we are purpose built for speed to support our clients’ ever-changing needs. We believe these characteristics provide a differentiated ability to thrive in high growth and large-scale environments. We reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic swiftly, enabling over 90% of our frontline employees to work-from-home soon after the commencement of lockdowns. The average time between the signing of a new client and having teammates fully engaged to work with the client was 14 days in 2021.
Leadership in Content Security and Wellness: The growth of social media platforms and the need to secure the user and advertiser generated content on these platforms has led to growth in demand for content moderation services. To care for the health and well-being of our front line teammates performing work in Content Security dealing with misinformation, offensive content, and critical policy issues, we have developed the TaskUs Resiliency Studio, a clinician-led and evidence-based psychological health and safety program. We couple this with advanced policy management expertise and an agile product development team focused on tools and innovation. 
Employer of Choice: Our culture has been recognized internationally and our eNPS was 70 in 2021. We believe this not only drives higher quality work and lower attrition, but also enables us to nimbly recruit additional employees to accommodate growth.
Founder-Led, Organic Growth Engine: Our Co-Founders and seasoned management team have meticulously built our employer brand and the agile operating model we rely upon to deliver for high growth clients. They have brought together a world class leadership team of service industry professionals who bring deep domain expertise to support their vision of a next generation services company; one that puts people at the center of its strategy to drive exceptional and sustainable growth. We have grown completely organically, leading to consistency in operations and culture which provides a strong foundation for future potential growth, organic or inorganic.
Growth Strategy
We intend to continue our growth trajectory through our five growth levers, taking advantage of attractive and actionable opportunities, including:
Growing with our Current Clients: As of December 31, 2021, we served over 100 of the world’s leading technology companies. In addition, over 99% of our revenues in 2021 were from recurring revenue contracts, and we achieved a net revenue retention rate of 141%.
We have a significant opportunity to enhance the penetration of current services as well as cross-sell new services. As our clients grow in size and the complexity of their outsourcing needs increases, we believe we have an opportunity to increase the addressable spend available to TaskUs. In 2021, 69 current clients signed new statements of work with us.
We invest heavily in strategic account management and planning through our Client Services organization to capture this opportunity. We have organized our Client Services organization around our strategic vertical markets to deliver domain expertise, industry insight, and best practices to expand our growth long term and ensure success.
New Client Wins: We are well positioned within multi-billion dollar commercial markets with substantial addressable spend opportunities where we focus on culturally aligned, agile companies that plan to scale rapidly. We believe a brand associated with high growth digital disruptors is desired by enterprise-class technology companies wishing to be more agile and looking for a different breed of partner. We plan to take advantage of our brand position and highly effective sales team, modeled after SaaS industry practices, to continue to diversify our client base and add more enterprise-class technology brands to our client list. We had a total of 41 new clients in 2021, and a new client win rate of 49%.
Our world-class sales team is organized around new economy industry verticals such as Entertainment + Gaming, FinTech, HealthTech, HiTech, On Demand Travel + Transportation, Retail + e-Commerce and Social Media. We identify emerging industry and funding trends to engage early and work with future market leaders and enterprise-class clients. We engage at the founder and C-suite level and use our experience and references to win new peer clients. We believe this cycle approach establishes credibility, expertise, and scale within a vertical niche. We intend to continue to utilize these tactics to expand and move up-market across current and newly identified industry verticals, or sub-verticals, we consider to have attractive growth prospects.
Expanded service offerings: We closely watch trends in the start-up and venture capital space, working with founders and investors to develop custom service offerings. This approach has earned us the opportunity to support some of the fastest growing companies in history, often before anyone else. 
In Content Security, we responded to the rise of Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFTs”) by rolling out a service focused on securing the marketplaces or games where these digital assets are bought and sold. This leverages our existing capabilities and brings an adjacent offering to the market. 
We aim to bolster our portfolio of highly complementary service capabilities by integrating consultative expertise, process automation, and technology that further expand our value proposition to clients. Services such as Content Security, anti-money laundering, fraud prevention and data science are areas we believe are particularly attractive and highly relevant for our forward-leaning technology client base.
Expanding Geographically: Global presence and multilingual capabilities are of increasing importance to our multinational clients and potential clients. New geographies mean new languages and/or capabilities to offer to our clients and increasing opportunities to win new business. We plan to continue expanding our geographic footprint to drive growth with both existing and new clients.

Year | Total Sites | Countries Entered | Total Countries
2019 | 13 | 1 (India) | 5 
2020 | 18 | 3 (Greece, Ireland, Colombia) | 8 
2021 | 23 | 2 (Malaysia, Japan)(1) | 10 

(1)    Operations in these new countries are expected to start in 2022.
Pursuing Opportunistic M&A: We intend to continue to evaluate M&A opportunities to expand into higher value, specialized services, add new geographies or add additional capabilities to support our teammates in delivering exceptional service. We intend to opportunistically add technical capabilities, including cognitive AI, process automation and efficiency tools that increase teammate effectiveness. Additionally, we will evaluate opportunities to expand to more premium services and end markets such as anti-money laundering, data and analytics and fraud detection platforms.
Consistent with this strategy, we regularly evaluate potential acquisition opportunities, including ones that would be significant to us. We cannot predict the timing of any contemplated transactions.
Solutions and Services
We work with disruptive technology companies in different stages of their life cycle ranging from high-growth venture capital-backed companies to innovative global public companies. The TaskUs platform is purpose-built and organized around the following three service offerings:
•Digital Customer Experience: Principally consists of omni-channel customer care services primarily delivered through digital (non-voice) channels. Other solutions include customer care services for new product or market launches, trust & safety solutions and customer acquisition solutions.
•Content Security: Principally consists of review and disposition of user and advertiser generated content for purposes which include removal or labeling of policy violating, offensive or misleading content. We are developing and enforcing Content Security policies in several areas including intellectual property, job and commerce postings, objectionable material, political advertising, as well as services related to the rise of NFTs, digital marketplaces and gaming platforms.
•Artificial Intelligence Operations: Principally consists of data labeling, annotation and transcription services performed for the purpose of training and tuning AI algorithms through the process of machine learning.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, Digital Customer Experience, Content Security and Artificial Intelligence Operations represented 64%, 22% and 14%, respectively, of our total service revenue of $760.7 million compared to 63%, 27% and 10%, respectively, of our total service revenue of $478.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Digital Customer Experience
Our clients in Digital Customer Experience are predominantly online or app-based businesses transforming industries such as ride-sharing, e-commerce, food and grocery delivery, streaming media, and online digital marketplaces. Our digitally native service offerings enable us to utilize lower cost non-voice channels. We leverage chat, social, in-app support, SMS, and in-platform solutions and apply an “automation first” mentality to our client engagements.
Engagement Lifecycle: When we begin a Digital CX engagement, we often lead with our consulting team. They bring deep expertise in channel strategy, tool selection, talent enablement and operations optimization. Once we have established an operating framework, our Implementations and Operations teams are brought in to build the project plan and execute the strategy. We identify the critical key performance indicators (“KPIs”) which define success and provide a roadmap for continuous improvement and implement them in real-time management dashboards. We execute these solutions through our team of highly-trained and dedicated omni-channel service experts, whom we call teammates. We create a deep connection between our teammates and our clients—we become brand ambassadors for our clients and are deeply integrated in their workflows. Their success is our success.
Our Digital Customer Experience solutions include:
Omni-Channel Customer Care: Protecting and maintaining our clients’ brands makes up a significant portion of our Digital CX services. In 2021, 92% of our Digital CX revenues were generated from non-voice, digital channels or omni-channel services, while the remaining 8% were generated purely from voice channels; even our pure voice work is supported by cloud-based infrastructure. This scale and breadth of over a decade of experience gives us a differentiated and mature perspective on how to tailor these channels to our clients. We customize the support experience to the specific client and channel we operate within, across account management, billing and technical support. When built correctly, digital channel 
support can deliver higher satisfaction, lower cost, and be easier to operate. We use the following operational levers to differentiate our performance for clients:
•Automating for Efficiency in Operations: We are focused on driving efficiency; both in our clients’ and our own business. We continually seek opportunities to eliminate simple, rote work so our teammates can deliver higher value services where our clients need them most. 
•Innovation and Insights: TaskUs has developed a differentiated insights and innovation governance model to help deliver frontline insights and advanced analytics and propose efficiencies through automation. We use data science, near-real-time dashboards and leadership insights—replacing static monthly reporting—to manage the continuous improvement of our programs and create alignment and transparency.
•Culture Builders: Our clients select us in part because of the culture we maintain; specifically, the culture of employee engagement that exists in our delivery sites around the world. Evolving marketplace, subscription, and SaaS models have resulted in a clear understanding of customer lifetime value. High-growth technology companies are cognizant that the customer experience they provide is a differentiator and our teammates are an extension of our clients’ respective brands. Tenured and engaged employees deliver better and more consistent results.
New Product or Market Launches: Our clients are often in a high-stakes race to get a new product launched or enter a new market. Through the dozens of clients we have supported in these efforts, we have designed a value-added framework of product and market launch playbooks. This gives us an edge as the go-to-partner for critical new growth initiatives. We operate as an extension of our clients’ in-house teams delivering key market insights, speed and agility, and frontline feedback on the true customer experience so they can adapt and win quickly in new initiatives.
Trust & Safety: Industries including ride-sharing, gaming, online dating, FinTech, streaming media and e-commerce sites are forced to spend time addressing bad-actors on their platforms. We position our most skilled teammates to perform the critical support needed to protect end users, detect and eliminate fraud, address unwanted user activity, and manage regulatory compliance. We believe Trust & Safety work allows us to move up-market with our clients, creating greater stickiness and increasing the value of our partnerships.
Customer Acquisition: TaskUs also helps digital disruptors acquire customers. TaskUs supports lead research, lead generation, appointment setting, new customer outreach and activation, retention, and advanced customer conversion from free and low cost subscription/product offerings to one of higher value and profitability. TaskUs’ approach to these services matches our clients’ new economy business models. We are customer experience focused and consultative, looking to add value to the user and secure our clients’ brand perception.
Voice of the Customer: TaskUs leverages its access to a wealth of internal and external customer experience data to provide insights and feedback on customer, process and product operations and policies. Our data science and analytics team assist by building data models for decision making on items such as customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Third-party tools are also utilized to gain additional insights from data outside of day-to-day operations items including social media feedback, product reviews, and industry trends. This service area delivers a more robust 360º view of customer sentiment to uncover strategies to improve the overall experience not often seen from traditional metrics such as customer satisfaction surveys.
TaskUs Digital CX Consulting: TaskUs Consulting Group provides a broader suite of services to our growth-stage clients beyond our day-to-day operational expertise. Clients often need assistance designing their customer experience programs and optimizing their operating environments; many skills they do not have in-house during the early part of their growth journeys. Consulting allows TaskUs to engage early and begin solving problems for clients without a long-term contract. It also helps us win new clients through deeper understanding of client pain points and desired outcomes. TaskUs Consulting Group offers the following areas of consulting expertise:
•Digital Customer Experience Strategy: customer journey mapping, channel strategy, chat bot and automation strategy.
•Human Capital and Talent Enablement: recruitment profile management, training redesign, knowledge base optimization and re-design.
•Operational Excellence: workflow and process mapping, best practice analysis on workforce, quality and analytics.
•Technology Assessment & Recommendations: tool evaluation, selection and implementation services.
Content Security
The rise of apps and social networks has led to the growth of user-generated content and advertising. To comply with government regulations and advertiser standards, social networks maintain complex platform policies to define what constitutes 
acceptable and unacceptable content and advertisements. These policies need to be constantly refined in response to emerging threats, evolving vernacular and increasing regulations.
•Government Regulation: For major social networks, not reviewing and removing inappropriate content is simply not an option. There is an ethical and moral imperative, which in recent years has become a legal obligation in some jurisdictions.
•Advertiser Sentiment: Advertisers have on multiple occasions pulled advertising dollars from social websites that fail to remove user-generated content they felt endangered their brand image.
Content Security Services
Content Security services rely on a combination of AI and human experts to review and remove offensive content. We have also developed proprietary technology that our Content Security teams use to improve their efficiency and accuracy.
AI can be leveraged effectively to remove text that is commonly understood to be objectionable and images that have previously been marked as offensive. Human Content Security experts step in to discern context, parse novel slang, and identify images that have been modified to intentionally avoid detection. Some forms of content violations can be successfully moderated using AI in the majority of cases, while other forms of violations require significant manual intervention. Sexual images or clearly offensive text is mostly removed in an automated fashion, whereas political advertising manipulation, bullying and hate speech mostly requires manual intervention. As a result of increasingly complex and nuanced policies, decisions are often ambiguous and nuanced, requiring Content Security experts to possess deep domain knowledge as well as broad cultural and market expertise.
We are developing and enforcing Content Security policies in several areas, including intellectual property, job and commerce postings, objectionable material, and political advertising. Our operational leadership teams develop a deep understanding of our clients’ processes and how to apply those policies efficiently and with high accuracy. We have a deep sense of purpose to protect our global society and we believe that content review is an integral part of a safe and open internet.
Highlights of our Content Security service offering include:
TaskUs Resiliency Studio: We view our employees who provide Content Security services as “Digital First Responders.” Most of the content our employees review is not offensive, but even constantly viewing misinformation or conspiracy theories can be challenging. To care for our employees’ well-being, we have developed the TaskUs Resiliency Studio, a clinician-led and evidence-based psychological health and safety program. This approach shapes every step of the employee life cycle:
•Our recruitment process provides transparency about the role and responsibilities, our interview process screens for psychological resiliency.
•Our training process prepares employees to recognize the signs of emotional burnout.
•On the job support resources include one-to-one and group counseling sessions. Given pandemic-related limitations on in-person meetings, at times our team utilizes virtual reality for counseling sessions.
•Post-employment support that makes these counseling resources available to any former teammate who needs them.
We have a staff of clinicians, licensed counselors, behavioral health researchers and other wellness professionals who have developed this approach and are responsible for the daily delivery of these services to our employees. We design our Content Security workspaces using advanced neurofeedback techniques to support employee well-being and reduce workplace stress. This is in addition to the benefits that TaskUs provides to most of its employees, including healthcare, and, while onsite, gyms, daycare, free or subsidized meals, and more.
The area of wellness is of critical importance to our clients, many of whom select vendors in large part based on their wellness and resiliency programs. They score us regularly on the robustness of our programs and our consistency of implementing them versus our competitors.
Global Policy Management: Our Content Security organization partners with our clients to apply best practices to policy development and distribution, product design, quality, and training. As a result of government regulations and cultural norms, major social networks must maintain increasingly distinct content policies in different geographies. These policies are dynamically updated in response to the latest threats and evolving bad actor behavior. TaskUs advises and supports clients’ policy development, and provides distribution and policy training.
Tools and Innovation: The tools used by employees providing Content Security services have a significant impact on efficiency, accuracy and quality. We partner with our clients to customize these toolsets and have developed proprietary technology to improve our own productivity and accuracy. Finally, our quality and training organization reviews employee 
decisions in an ongoing fashion, in order to close the feedback loop through coaching and performance management. We intend to continue devoting significant resources to these dedicated Content Security and wellness teams. 
Artificial Intelligence Operations
Intelligent applications based on Artificial Intelligence are core to the digital economy. AI applications are created by annotating datasets to train an algorithm in a process called Machine Learning. We first began supporting AI applications over a decade ago, including next-generation product development efforts such as transcribing voicemail messages for visual voicemail solutions and manually scoring the sentiment of social media posts for social listening tools. Today, our services have increased in sophistication and complexity as AI applications have evolved.
We have been investing in digital innovation, including in our AI Operations offering, to meet the growing demand in this service offering. We have developed internal applications to help our current teammates be more efficient and have launched the “TaskVerse” platform to expand our reach for additional talent. We see this platform as a system that could supplement the work that we do to support large-scale AI projects and deliver rapid results by leveraging a combination of TaskUs employees and globally distributed experts.
Our Artificial Intelligence Operations solutions include:
Data Annotation: We build large sets of training data for our clients by annotating videos, photos, audio clips and text based on their policy specifications. The quality of this training data is based on the accuracy of our annotation and plays a large role in the success of the resulting AI algorithm. As AI becomes more sophisticated and its applications become more global it can require data sets that are annotated by people who speak various languages and come from varying backgrounds and cultures. We believe that the TaskVerse platform could help us supplement our capabilities to meet these needs.
 Examples of the applications that Data Annotation powers include:
Computer Vision: Algorithms which allow a computer to “see” the world require millions of labeled images. For mission critical applications such as autonomous vehicles these images often must be labeled down to a single pixel.
Natural Language Processing: To understand the meaning of phrases, algorithms are trained with large sets of written text that has been annotated based on parts of speech, meaning and sentiment.
Video Processing: Understanding videos requires the segmentation and recombination of two distinct training data sets—audio and visual. The audio file must be transcribed and annotated to enable Natural Language Processing and objects in the image files must be tagged to enable Computer Vision.
Sensor Processing: Refining algorithms which make decisions based on sensor data requires annotated sets of sensor data from sources such as the LiDAR systems of autonomous vehicles.
We group our algorithm training services into three phases: learning, generalizing, and predicting. Each of the three phases of development requires distinct support methodologies including quality, training, and knowledge management.
Our future vision includes supporting algorithms for facial recognition, teaching new autonomous vehicles like drones to fly, identifying bullying in real-time on live gaming platforms, reading MRIs and x-rays accurately and helping to automatically detect cyber-security attacks; among many others. We are in the process of developing an application suite to increase our capabilities.
Sales and Marketing
New Client Sales Highlights
*Deal duration reflects the number of days between the creation of an opportunity in our opportunity management system and when a contract is signed or lost. This includes opportunities for both New Clients and Existing Clients.
In Silicon Valley, Alley, and Beach, and throughout the globe, we believe TaskUs is known for its work with recognizable technology companies. This differentiated brand position has been carefully crafted over the past decade. From our founding days, our sales team has walked the halls of TechCrunch Disrupt, Websummit, and SXSW to meet the seed stage disruptors who could ultimately become growth stage category leaders. We scour funding sources and backchannel through our venture capital and private equity relationships, keeping our finger to the pulse of what’s happening on the ground floor in emerging technology.
With this knowledge, we develop thesis-led prospecting strategies, and apply a multi-faceted pipeline generation process to have conversations with emerging companies, even if they are years away from being ready to engage us. We invite them to our conferences, share value added content and host them at Founders’ Dinners and events in an effort to build genuine relationships as their trusted advisors. We believe our perseverance and dedication have positioned us to be the first call for emerging consumer technology companies on the verge of hyper growth.
The TaskUs sales strategy delivers within our targeted industry verticals through the following methodology:
Verticalized sales approach: We align the sales team to industry verticals for solution consistency, case studies, references, common pain points and industry insight. By focusing on industry verticals, we develop deep domain expertise to better engage with our clients, understand their pain points, and provide superior solutions. Once on-boarded, the client relationship is handed off to our account management organization, known as Client Services, which is organized in a consistent verticalized approach.
We focus on the disruptive tech-based, high-growth industry verticals of large commercial markets. We approach the lifecycle of a vertical by identifying the market, engaging in opportunities, winning marquee clients, expanding within the industry, and moving up-market. In 2021, we achieved a 49% new client win rate for every dollar of opportunity we pursued. TaskUs thoughtfully enters new industry verticals, or sub-verticals, when we identify emerging trends. We learn from each client we win and use this knowledge to further refine our sales strategy.
Penetrate and Radiate: Excellence in operations earns us trust and the right to take on additional work. In 2021, we achieved a 64 cNPS. Using data science and insights gives us an understanding of new problems to solve for clients. We present proactive proposals in our quarterly business reviews and bring in our consulting teams to look for opportunities for continuous improvement. We believe these approaches unlock additional opportunities for work of greater complexity and importance.
We invest heavily in strategic account management and planning through our Client Services organization to capture this opportunity. We have organized our Client Services organization around our strategic vertical markets to deliver domain expertise, industry insight, and best practices to expand our growth long term with these clients and ensure success.
Community Driven Marketing: Our marketing efforts are focused on leveraging our community and creating an ecosystem where prospects can engage with us and learn about our value proposition.
•CX Summit: Twice a year, we host a conference with hundreds of customer experience professionals, both clients and future clients of TaskUs. The summit features keynote speakers sharing their experiences and best practices, and roundtable discussions where leaders can connect with other leaders.
•Ridiculously Good Dinners: We have hosted many dinners bringing together founders and C-suite level executives of notable technology companies.
•Ridiculously Good Events: We invite VIPs in our community to get to know us and each other through unique experiences. We believe these events contribute to significant new opportunities and goodwill with our prospects.
While COVID-19 has impacted how we engage with prospects, we have been able to transition some of our marketing efforts to a virtual environment. 
Effective and Highly-Efficient: We maintain an effective and efficient sales operating model by using industry-leading tools and a highly leveraged offshore sales support model.
•World-class sales operations, lead and demand generation, using Salesforce Sales Cloud and Pardot. The TaskUs sales approach is based on modern SaaS industry sales models versus classic outsourcing models which tend to be “top heavy,” with numerous highly paid sales executives that are responsible for all parts of the sales process (demand generation through deal closure) and generally close only one or two deals per year. We believe we have created a scalable sales engine that doesn’t rely on these “rainmakers,” alone, but leverages junior level sales talent developed in-house to create effective sales teams. These teams take advantage of skilled proposal, marketing and demand generation resources offshore for support. We believe this approach lowers the total cost of sales and creates repeatability and sustainability by maintaining the entire sales funnel at all times.
•Most of our non-client facing resources in sales, client services (account management), and marketing are based offshore. Our graphic design, video-editing, proposal management, and lead research teams tap into the immense creative talent and process expertise of the Philippines and India.
•Vertically aligned Business Development Representatives (“BDRs,” also known as inside sales) triage marketing qualified leads, perform outbound outreach to prospects, and generate pipeline while our Sales Executives and Vice Presidents operate as “capture execs” focusing on deal closure and value delivery. These BDRs have also become the “bench-strength” of our sales and client services teams moving up into more senior roles over time and aligning to our team-based sales culture.
Delivery and Operations
TaskUs operations are designed to scale rapidly with perpetual experimentation and iteration and a devotion to data-driven decision making. Many of our clients have little to no outsourcing experience. Given the rapid scale required to keep up with the growth of their businesses, they choose to outsource certain services. Unlike more mature buyers of outsourced 
services, our clients rarely deliver us a prescriptive playbook for how to run our operations. We work with our clients to understand their objectives and design the most efficient process to meet and exceed these goals. In our 2021 cNPS Survey, 73% of all respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their programs’ operational performance expectations are regularly met. To deliver to these standards we offer:
•Subject Matter Expertise: We have “SME” teams in each of our primary services—Digital Customer Experience, Content Security and Artificial Intelligence Operations. 
•Project Management Organization: Our “PMO” is the linchpin between sales and operations to ensure client success. 
•Modern Service Excellence: We use real-time dashboards and KPI management to meet and exceed our clients’ expectations. Our process discipline has allowed us to achieve multiple certifications and compliance standards including SOC 2 Type 2, HIPAA and PCI-DSS.
•Agile Automation: There are often opportunities to continuously improve our efficiency and quality with our own technology. Our Digital Innovation team focuses on rapid prototyping using lightweight technical solutions like browser based extensions, robotic process automation, and productivity and workflow analytics.
•Data Science and Analytics: Our Business Intelligence teams apply data science to client data to drive insights back into our operations in a cycle of continuous improvement.
At the core of our operations are scaled teams of employees, our TaskUs teammates. These individuals ultimately determine the quality of service we provide our clients and, as such, we are obsessive about the standards of our frontline teammates and our team leaders, the first level of management, and dedicate the necessary resources to attract and retain this talent. We have organized our global operating model around our sites, which are run by operations leaders, who act as “Site CEOs.”
Our operations are supported by centralized shared services based in the Philippines and India. Each of our sites has at least one leader on-site from each of our support functions, including Human Resources, Workforce Management and Information Technology. The combination of onsite leadership with scaled shared services allows us to support our Site CEO model in a cost effective manner and execute processes with the appropriate consistency globally while accounting for local nuance.
Additionally, we launched TaskVerse, a platform to expand the reach of our AI Operations work, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. We expect that TaskVerse will allow us to supplement the work we do for large-scale AI Operations engagements and deliver rapid results by leveraging a combination of TaskUs employees and globally distributed freelance experts.
We leverage technology to deliver coaching, training, and support services at scale. Our proprietary coaching platform, Boost, is used daily by our frontline team leaders to coach their teammates and for our entire executive team to manage weekly one-to-ones and quarterly performance appraisals. Our learning-management-system, ACE, is used to enable self-paced client specific training and certification. Our Global Knowledge Support Center, Glowstick, is an employee engagement platform used to provide self service and support ticketing for all areas of our business.
Utilizing primarily offshore and near-shore markets is a central tenet of our service delivery strategy. Since 95% of our revenue in 2021 was delivered from non-voice, digital channels or omni-channel services, we are particularly well positioned to leverage an off-shore / near-shore model.
As of December 31, 2021, we provided our services through a network of twenty-three locations in ten countries, including two countries where operations are expected to start in 2022, and employed approximately 40,100 people worldwide. The Philippines is our largest off-shore market with approximately 27,100 employees, or 68% of total employees. In addition to our on-site operations, we utilize an internally developed cloud-based platform, Cirrus, which enables our employees to deliver services remotely on behalf of our clients. Given the recent shift to work-from-home at TaskUs during COVID-19, we expect our Cirrus Work@Home platform to be a meaningful part of our future delivery model.

Culture and Human Capital Resources
We believe that serving frontline employees helps us to better serve our clients. As we have expanded across the globe, we strive to champion our vision of operational excellence through an employee-centric culture at every site.
Many of the companies operating in the Digital Economy are well-known for their obsession with creating a world-class employee experience. We believe clients choose TaskUs in part because they view our company culture as aligned with their own, which enables us to act as a natural extension of their brands and gives us an advantage in the recruitment of highly engaged frontline teammates who produce better results. 
Our philosophy is simple: treat people well and they will deliver a better end customer experience which leads to happy clients and a thriving business. Our employees are the core of our business. Our success depends on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain sufficient numbers of employees in a timely fashion at our sites to support our operations. Our employee-centric culture, our focus on employee wellness and satisfaction and our employee-centric site selection enable us to meet that challenge and motivate our employees to stay for the long term. Our happy, motivated and hardworking employees in turn produce high-quality work for our clients.
We continually work on our company culture like it is a product we sell in the market, by listening to our employees, similar to how we listen to our clients. We leverage this feedback to drive continuous improvement, conduct quality control to ensure global consistency, and award bonuses to our executives based on achieving their culture-related goals. Our primary culture-related goal metric is eNPS, the single most important barometer we use to measure employee engagement. In 2021, our eNPS was 70, and 78% of our employees who participated rated us 9 or 10 on a scale of 10. 
Our executive team reviews the survey score and thousands of verbatim comments. We take the feedback and create specific and measurable goals we believe will impact parts of our culture. Our ability to maintain high eNPS scores enables us to drive real business impact. We believe it drives improved attendance as our teammates show up on time and excited to work. We believe happy employees deliver better results and higher retention. The voluntary attrition rate for employees who were employed by TaskUs for more than 180 days was 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021.
None of our employees belong to a labor union and we have never suffered a material interruption of business as a result of a labor dispute. We consider our relations with our employees worldwide to be good.
Our Clients
As of December 31, 2021, we served over 100 clients, the majority of which are disruptive technology companies in attractive, high growth industry verticals, including social media, e-commerce, gaming, streaming media, food delivery and ride sharing, HiTech, FinTech and HealthTech. We work with a broad range of clients in different stages of their lifecycle, ranging from start-up companies to well-capitalized and established public companies with scaled operations. Our top ten and top twenty clients accounted for 62% and 76% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Our largest client, Meta, formerly known as Facebook, and our second largest client, DoorDash generated 27% and 11% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. We have multiple agreements across several lines of business with our largest and second largest clients, which generally include a description of the services provided by TaskUs, invoicing and payment terms, the number of TaskUs employees to be assigned to a given campaign in each location in which the work is performed, client obligations for providing headcount forecasting and notice in the event of an increase or decrease in volume, and renewal and termination provisions, including termination for convenience subject to advance notice requirements of varying length. Under these agreements, our service fees are generally subject to minimums and maximums, depending on whether the actual volume of services provided falls below or exceeds periodic volume forecasts provided by these clients.
Our Competition
We compete in a large and fragmented market. We believe the principal competitive factors in our business include vendor company culture; ability to act as partners and support innovation; quality of personnel and service; breadth of offering; scalability and global coverage; ability to apply technology to improve efficiency and quality; and pricing.
TaskUs is exclusively focused on the Digital Economy. We identify emerging industry verticals, and attractive sub-segments, and have a demonstrated track record of rapidly scaling in the industries we target. Unlike traditional outsourced providers, whose voice-based solutions largely cater to telecommunications, cable and financial services companies, we provide a global, omni-channel delivery model focused on supporting digital solutions.
We believe technology disruptors ranging from startups to market leaders choose TaskUs because of our:
•deep expertise in working with companies in the Digital Economy;
•corporate culture that resembles their own;
•leading employee wellness programs;
•high quality teammates and strong employee engagement;
•differentiated tech-enabled offerings combined with value added consulting services; and
•proven ability to rapidly scale.
Intellectual Property
The success of our business depends, in part, on our proprietary technology and intellectual property, including our proprietary processes and know-how. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in research and development to enhance our knowledge and capabilities, and to create specialized solutions for our clients. We rely on a combination of laws, security and confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information.
We require our employees to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us, which assign to us all deliverables and work product made, developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or provision of services, including the intellectual property rights therein. These agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us remains confidential.
We also enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our clients. These customary agreements cover our use of our clients’ software systems and platforms as our clients often own the intellectual property in the products we develop for them. Furthermore, we sometimes grant a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, transferable and irrevocable license to our clients to use our pre-existing intellectual property, but only to the extent necessary in order to use the software or systems we develop for them.
We have registered or are registering various trademarks and service marks in the United States and other countries, including for “TaskUs.” In some countries we also have common law rights to certain trademarks and service marks, including “Ridiculously Good Outsourcing.” Our ability to obtain trademark registrations varies from country to country, as does the 
duration of trademark and service mark registrations, which may generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the marks are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.
We also have and maintain certain trade secrets arising out of the authorship or creation of proprietary applications, systems and business practices. Confidentiality is maintained primarily through contractual clauses, and in the case of computer programs and information maintained in our electronic systems and networks, system access controls, tracking and authorization processes.
Our Technology
We maintain an innovative, flexible, scalable, resilient, and reliable technology infrastructure that helps us deliver our services and solutions to our clients. We utilize what we believe are industry-leading hardware and software components to provide for and enable the rapid growth of our business. We employ virtual desktop infrastructure in some of our solutions, facilitating secure remote access from anywhere and promoting efficiency. We constantly evaluate new technology to further reduce our costs, maintain our system integrity and security, and improve our services and efficiency. We are continuously investing in applications, tools and infrastructure to manage all aspects of our business, while maintaining control, adaptability, and visibility, both internally and to our clients.
Maintaining the integrity and security of our technology infrastructure is critical to our business, and as such we leverage what we believe are industry-leading and sophisticated security and monitoring tools to promote security and continued performance across our network. We maintain processes and tools to protect our and our clients’ and their customers’ confidential and other sensitive information, and allocate necessary resources to promote information security and data privacy, both on our and our clients’ platforms. We have made significant investments in the appropriate people, training, processes and technology to establish and manage compliance with confidentiality policies, obligations contained in our client contracts and laws and regulations governing our activities, such as the European Union and United Kingdom data protection legal framework referred to as the General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and others.
The cloud-based technology supporting our services and solutions is flexible and scalable, and designed according to our clients’ needs. We also integrate with our clients’ existing platforms where required in order to deliver our services and solutions anywhere our clients need them. Our Project Management Organization mobilizes quickly to minimize our clients’ time-to-market. 
Our strong operational standards and metrics emphasize operational excellence and data analytics to improve our performance and provide better results for our clients. For example, we build custom dashboards for our clients to provide real-time data insights, removing the need to wait for monthly reports. Our custom dashboards are one way we use technology to differentiate ourselves from competitors and to drive efficiency and build trust with our clients.
Our physical network is maintained by a high-quality infrastructure and networking organization, which consists of people around the world who are dedicated to pursuing seamless, uninterrupted service delivery to our clients. In addition, we have dedicated security and compliance professionals responsible for cyber security, fraud, and compliance.
Regulation
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, export taxation, export controls, economic sanctions and other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that are contradictory to each other, and/or could harm our business. In addition, the terms of our service contracts typically require that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. In some of our service contracts, we are contractually required to comply even if such laws and regulations apply to our clients, but not to us, and sometimes our clients require us to take specific steps intended to make it easier for our clients to comply with requirements that are applicable to them. If we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, we may be restricted in our ability to provide services, and may also be the subject of civil or criminal actions involving penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal and state, as well as international laws and regulations, including those regarding privacy and data security, and we or our clients may be subject to regulations related to the processing of certain types of sensitive and confidential information. Any failure to comply with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.”
Tax
Several of our sites located within special economic zones in the Philippines benefit from favorable tax treatment provided by registrations with Philippine Economic Zone Authority (“PEZA”). These benefits vary from site to site and may include income tax holidays, reduced income taxes, and reduced VAT. Under the PEZA registrations, favorable tax treatment 
for certain of our PEZA-registered sites expired, but may be renewed for subsequent periods provided we meet the criteria for Net Foreign Exchange Earnings (“NFEE”) and Capital Equipment Labor Ratio (“CELR”). While we believe the ability to meet these requirements is within our control, there can be no assurance that we will retain these benefits in the future.
The initial term of the income tax holiday for three of our sites has expired. One of our sites expired as of July 2021, and cannot be extended further; a second site expired on December 31, 2020, and we expect it be retro-actively extended through December 31, 2021; and a third site expired in September 2020 and we expect it to be retro-actively extended through September 2022. We continue to engage with PEZA in order to meet the necessary criteria for favorable tax treatment and will file the extension applications before each respective due date.
Data Privacy and Security
We are subject to state, federal and international laws and regulations that require us to maintain the privacy and security of personally identifiable information that we process, including GDPR, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, as amended, and related regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”) and the CCPA. Our legal and information security teams are responsible for overseeing our data protection strategy and implementation to monitor our compliance with such laws and regulations, including by managing, implementing, and overseeing internal privacy policies and security measures, such as the regular monitoring and testing of systems and equipment. We are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI-DSS”).
HIPAA 
Certain of our clients require solutions that ensure security given the nature of the content being distributed and associated applicable regulatory requirements. In particular, our employees may access protected health information in compliance with the requirements of HIPAA. HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting protected health information for or on behalf of such covered entities. HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates, like us, to develop and maintain policies with respect to the protection of, and use the disclosure of electronic protected health information, including the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information, and to follow certain notification requirements in the event of a breach. Violations of HIPAA may result in significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose protected health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties. As a “business associate,” we are directly liable for compliance with HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements. We also have obligations under the business associate agreements that we are required to enter into with certain clients that are covered by HIPAA and certain subcontractors that we engage in connection with our business operations.
Content Moderation
Certain laws may apply to content moderation, such as laws regulating hate speech on the internet. In the United States, the CDA Section 230 shields “interactive computer services” (e.g., websites, social media platforms) from liability for the speech of their users (with certain exceptions). The law also shields interactive computer services from civil liability for a good faith action voluntarily taken to restrict access to or availability of content that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected. CDA Section 230, and other laws related to hate speech on the internet, are currently the topic of significant debate. We expect that these laws will continue to evolve and change over time.
Anti-Corruption
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements.
Globally, other countries in which we operate have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA, such as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act in the Philippines and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, all of which prohibit companies and their intermediaries from bribing government officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or 
otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices, although adherence to local customs and practices is generally not a defense under U.S. and other anti-bribery laws. We maintain a Global Code of Conduct and various other policies against bribery and corruption, and train and monitor our employees to act in accordance with these policies.
Corporate and Social Responsibility
At TaskUs, we believe in doing well by doing good. We are committed to integrating positive social, environmental and ethical practices into our business, and giving back to the local communities that have afforded us incredible opportunity. We give back as a company, but also encourage our local sites to give back and volunteer. We even provide our clients and potential clients, opportunities to get involved in our social responsibility initiatives, as we believe this develops deeper ties when they know we are a company that prioritizes giving back. As a professional services company, the largest aspects of our environmental footprint are the greenhouse gas emissions related to electricity used in our offices and travel, which we do not believe to be significant.
We think of Corporate and Social Responsibility as an extension of our culture, and through our focused efforts in the areas of education, environment, and diversity and inclusion we create positive change while strengthening our business. 
Our efforts have been recognized, including winning the Social Responsibility Award by Investors in People for 2019.
Community
The following are some of our initiatives we offer to build community:
•Typhoon Odette Fundraising Project in December 2021 provided our Philippines families immediate access to food and shelter for those who were impacted by the evacuations, road closures, flooding, landslides, power outages and many sleepless nights as a result of the typhoon. Out TaskUs Teammates came together and raised funds to help thousands of Teammates in need.
•COVID-19 Vaccination Drives were also conducted across different countries where vaccines are limited. Over the past year, we partnered with different private and government organizations to make vaccines available for our Teammates and their families. We have inoculated employees in the Philippines, India and Colombia through these TaskUs-led drives.
•TaskUs Next-Gen Scholarship in 2021, TaskUs paid for the private education for 900+ TaskUs employees, our biggest cohort in the history of the program.
•TaskUs for Texans: In August 2021, we partnered with the African American Community Archive Museum for a School Drive event where we donated backpacks full of supplies to the San Antonio community and African American children’s books to the museum and for the kids who attended to take home. In November 2021, we partnered with Monster Moms (an organization dedicated to helping parents in need) by donating turkeys and hams to the community.
•Project Stark: A COVID-19 response launched to aid employees and communities affected by the pandemic. Funds were pooled to distribute to employees as a one-time financial aid, and Food Forward Funds were redirected to support frontline health workers, public hospitals, and partner-communities. Funds were used to provide oxygen tanks and sets of PPEs including Hazmat suits, N95 masks, goggles, bouffant caps, surgical gloves, shoe covers, and heavy-duty PVC face shield visors to protect frontline health workers as they go on their life saving work of testing and treating COVID-19 patients; food packs, medicines, hygiene kits, disinfectants and cleaning supplies to our 20 Food Forward partner communities; and additional assistance to our third-party service providers and their families who could not work at the time.
•Food Forward was launched in 2018 and is our main fundraising channel present in every TaskUs office in the Philippines. Patterned after the ‘Pay It Forward’ concept, the Company provides its employees with a complete and balanced meal every day in exchange for a nominal donation to fund our various social responsibility projects. This four year old program has served meals to TaskUs employees in the hopes of inspiring them to help their local community and together, we have worked with over 20 different community partners that serve displaced indigent children, out of school youth, public schools, animal welfare, senior citizens, victims of domestic violence, victims of human-trafficking, the elderly and homeless, members of the LGBTQ+ community, as well as adults and children with disabilities. While COVID-19 has limited this initiative, we expect it will ramp-up as teammates continue to return to our facilities.
•Community Partnerships with military programs and universities for career development.
•Exploring Environmental Sustainability: In April 2021, we celebrated Earth Day by volunteering to help pick up litter and spread wildflower seeds to restore and beautify the Hidden Trails Amenity Center Park in San Antonio, Texas. We provided goodie bags for kids to take home that included seeds for them to grow their own veggies, snacks, and coloring books. Our ridiculous team in Atlanta joined in by creating their own event in the park and passing out goodie bags with the same materials.
Diversity
Our diversity strategy is rooted in education and action. We source Teammates from marginalized and disadvantaged groups, educate our workforce via diversity and inclusion (“D&I”) resources and employee-led groups, encourage conversation and action around racial and social justice issues, and make contributions to our local communities.
We owe it to everyone to achieve collaborative solidarity – that is, create safe spaces where more advanced opportunities are made available to people from marginalized communities, allowing them to thrive.
TaskUs encourages individuals of all walks of life regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, or social standing to join our team and add to the richness of our diverse culture. As of December 31, 2021, women made up 53% of our workforce and 47% of our managers at all levels. Specifically, our D&I initiatives include:
•Sourcing and Social Partnerships with public schools and universities, military veteran communities, and various non-government organizations across geographies.
•Employee D&I Resources which empower employees to take on racial & social justice issues and offer unconscious bias training for leaders, recruiters, and hiring managers.
•Global Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are employee-led to educate, drive change & foster collaboration in the workplace while making contributions to local communities through our George Floyd Memorial Fund.
•TaskUs Supplier Diversity Program partners with minority-owned, women-owned, veteran-owned, service disability-owned, and LGBTQ+-owned businesses.
