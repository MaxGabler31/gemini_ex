Item 1. Business.
Overview
Data is foundational to our customers’ digital transformation, and we are focused on delivering innovative and disruptive data storage technologies, products and services that enable customers to maximize the value of their data.
We are a global leader in data storage and management with a mission to redefine the storage experience by simplifying how people consume and interact with data. Our vision integrates our foundation of simplicity and reliability with three major market trends that are impacting all organizations large and small: (1) adoption of the cloud operating model everywhere; (2) the increase of modern cloud-native applications; and (3) the shift to modernizing today’s data infrastructure with all-flash.
Our products and subscription services support a wide range of structured and unstructured data, at scale and across any data workloads in hybrid and public cloud environments, and include mission-critical production, test and development, analytics, disaster recovery (DR), and backup and recovery.
Differentiated Technology
Innovation and technology leadership is core to our culture, products and services, and future growth strategies. We have developed highly differentiated technology that is the foundation of our portfolio of products and services and create significant and sustainable competitive advantages.
Flash Software and Hardware Leadership
We pioneered the use of solid-state, All-Flash technology in enterprise storage with a clean-slate approach to building Flash-based systems and have continued to expand our leadership position and technology differentiation across our tightly integrated software and hardware.
Our Purity Software was designed from the ground-up to maximize the benefits of solid-state storage. By focusing on All-Flash, our Purity software is able to deliver superior performance, reliability, cost, density and environmental sustainability efficiencies.
•Performance - Purity optimizes how data is placed and accessed on Flash to dramatically reduce the overheads and inefficiencies introduced by solid state drives (SSDs), allowing us to drive both higher performance and greater predictability.
•Reliability - Purity also makes it possible to optimize the use of Flash in our systems. This translates directly into high reliability and durability as well as longer service lifetimes of our arrays.
•Efficiency - Designed-for-flash algorithms and data structures allow us to deliver significantly higher storage efficiency from Flash than magnetic disk-based software by reducing over-provisioning or wasted Flash that would otherwise be needed. Our Purity software also delivers data reduction (e.g., compression and deduplication) creating significant savings and efficiencies for our customers.
•Environmental Benefits - Our Flash-optimized integrated hardware and software enables our products to deliver the same amount of data storage requiring one tenth the amount of power, space, cooling and e-waste of magnetic disk, and up to one fifth the amount of power and cooling of competitive all-flash systems, and half their space required.
Our Purity software is shared across our products and provides leading enterprise-class data services such as always-on data-reduction, data protection and encryption, as well as a wide range of storage protocols such as block, file and object.
The advantages unlocked by our Purity software are significantly amplified by our integrated DirectFlash hardware technology. With DirectFlash, we build Flash Modules designed to work directly with NAND Flash chips, highly integrated and optimized for our Purity software. This deep integration of hardware and software allows us to deliver even greater performance, reliability and efficiency from mainstream triple-level cell (TLC) flash and capacity-oriented quad-level cell (QLC) flash that delivers unparalleled density.
While QLC can make flash more economical, it requires significantly more sophisticated management, optimization and tuning to use effectively. With DirectFlash, we deliver the performance and density benefits of QLC flash, without compromising on efficiency, reliability or performance consistency. With DirectFlash, we are leading the industry, allowing us to accelerate the transition of disk to flash by replacing low-cost hybrid-flash and disk arrays.
Evergreen Architecture
Our Evergreen architecture means that our products do not become obsolete or require wholesale replacement like traditional systems. Evergreen allows our arrays to be upgraded non-disruptively, allowing our customers to continuously benefit from the latest hardware and software technology, reducing disruptive, costly and unnecessary product replacements. Several key technology elements are required to deliver on our Evergreen promise:
•Future-proof Hardware - We design and build our hardware platforms for higher reliability and longer service lifetimes to provide our customers the maximum benefit of Flash. Our hardware platforms are designed for each component (e.g. storage controllers, flash modules) to be independently replaceable and upgradable, allowing customers to have access to continuous and ever-improving hardware technology without requiring a wholesale replacement.
•Non-Disruptive Upgrades - A critical technology that allows us to keep customer systems continually up-to-date is the ability to upgrade both hardware and software completely non-disruptively. Continuous online improvement, without creating disruption or affecting running production systems, is required for customers to realize the full benefits of Evergreen and are a critical underpinning of delivering a full as-a-Service experience.
•Telemetry and Pure1 - Continuous telemetry collection coupled with intelligent analytics supported by machine learning models allow us to proactively address issues before they occur. This capability delivers both predictive and proactive recommendations, targeted assessments, and workload planning based on knowledge accumulated across our entire fleet. Pure1 allows us to target and focus the most relevant innovation and improvements to our customers, delivered through Evergreen.
Sustainable Technology
Our technology differentiators also deliver significant environmental sustainability benefits. DirectFlash allows us to build the most efficient and densest flash modules which has a direct effect on both cost and power efficiency - by providing more effective storage with less physical equipment, we lower the costs of our systems as well as their environmental footprint. 
The environmental benefits of this approach are outlined in our inaugural Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) report, which shows that our arrays are up to 80% more energy efficient than competitive all-flash products. Additionally, two key environmental benefits of our Evergreen architecture include the reduction of both wasted energy and e-waste through non-disruptive upgrades and increased lifespan of our products. In fact, 97% of our arrays purchased six years ago are still in service. For more information about the ESG benefits of our technology, see our ESG report at https://www.purestorage.com/company/corporate-social-responsibility.html.

Our Product and Services Growth Initiatives
Our growth initiatives are driven by two significant secular trends - continued transition from disk to flash, and the cloud-driven adoption of cloud-native applications and the cloud operating model.
Our multi-faceted cloud business objectives include: (i) to be a leader in enabling cloud-native applications; (ii) enable portability of data services and applications across on-premise and cloud-environments; (iii) deliver the full cloud operating model - on-premises or in and across public clouds; and (iv) lead the transition from disk to flash in the hyperscalers and cloud providers.
Our focus across four growth initiatives described below enables us to participate in a $60B+ fast growing storage and storage as-a-service Total Addressable Market (TAM).
Grow our subscription services business and drive differentiation with as-a-Service and Cloud operating model
We are leading in the storage as-a-service market. We are outperforming the market because we are focused on providing these services through our technology rather than merely creating a financial and professional services construct.
We pioneered the Evergreen upgradable architecture that brings the benefits of the cloud operating model to an on-premises storage purchase. Pure as-a-Service extends the Evergreen architecture and subscription to deliver storage to customers as capacity and performance SLAs in a much more flexible, optimized and efficient manner.
Deliver hybrid cloud architecture and data services for modern applications
We are extending our leadership position in delivering the cloud operating model and enabling cloud-native applications. We are empowering our customers to run and operate storage as-a-service, for both traditional and modern applications. We are committed to delivering a hybrid cloud architecture and advancing in the high-growth space of cloud-native applications. Our Portworx product is the leader in the enterprise container data space, providing customers a secure solution to both their primary container storage needs, as well as their critical data workflows like backup, DR and migration.
Portworx, along with Cloud Block Store, allows us to help customers make their hybrid-cloud real by enabling them to run and deploy both traditional and cloud-native apps on-premise and in-cloud with the same process and operations.
Our announcements in September 2021 of Pure Fusion and PDS extend our promise to deliver a true hybrid cloud architecture to hybrid environments.

PDS creates another first mover advantage as we enable IT departments of our customers to provide and manage sophisticated data services with rapid deployment, scaling, management and self-service onboarding for their line of business users.
Gain market share in the core block All-Flash market through innovative leadership
We aim to take market share and outgrow the competition in the core all-flash block market with a proven “Simplicity at Scale” strategy, our highly differentiated customer experience with our Evergreen construct, and additional enterprise and service provider features and capabilities. Our core technology is also charting the path in the hyperscale and large enterprise environments for mainstream flash adoption which were previously dominated by mechanical disk.
Expand All-Flash into new used cases served by disk today
We continue to drive industry disruption by further expanding flash into historical disk use cases, leveraging our flash software leadership, currently with QLC. We see a tremendous growth opportunity as Flash economics coupled with the growth in unstructured data disrupt the current hybrid and mechanical disk market.
Our extended advantage stems from three technology differentiators: Our leadership with direct-to-NAND software, our integrated hardware/software direct flash modules, and our data reduction capabilities. Because of our highly sophisticated Flash management software requiring less NAND, we drive significant efficiency advantages over SSDs by eliminating over-provisioning, extending endurance and requiring far less common equipment.
Modern unstructured data workloads, including artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), genomics, Internet of Things (IoT), self-driving vehicles, and analytics, are some of the largest generators of data. They require not just performance and scale, but dozens of applications working with that data along the way as it is collected, indexed, processed and analyzed. It requires unifying unstructured data access, which is inherent in our FlashBlade product, across file and object protocols, across input/output (I/O) types, and across application demands.
FlashBlade, combined with our multi-year advantage in flash technology and our leadership with Portworx, puts us in a unique position to win at the confluence of the growth of unstructured data and modern applications.
