Item 1 - Business
Overview
Albertsons is one of the largest food and drug retailers in the United States, with both strong local presence and national scale. We also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our stores. We maintain a website (www.Albertsonscompanies.com) that includes additional information about the Company. We make available through our website, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and our interactive data files, including amendments. These forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with, or furnished them electronically to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Additionally, all of our filings with the SEC can be accessed on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
Retail Operations
As of February 26, 2022, we operated 2,276 stores across 34 states and the District of Columbia under 24 banners including Albertsons, Safeway, Vons, Pavilions, Randalls, Tom Thumb, Carrs, Jewel-Osco, Acme, Shaw's, Star Market, United Supermarkets, Market Street, Haggen, Kings Food Markets and Balducci's Food Lovers Market. Additionally, as of February 26, 2022, we operated 1,722 pharmacies, 1,317 in-store branded coffee shops, 402 adjacent fuel centers, 22 dedicated distribution centers, 20 manufacturing facilities and various digital platforms. Our stores operate in First-and-Main retail locations and have leading market share within attractive and growing geographies. We hold a #1 or #2 position by market share in 68% of the 121 metropolitan statistical areas ("MSAs") in which we operate. Our portfolio of well-located, full-service stores provides the foundation of our omnichannel platform, and we have continued to enhance our capabilities to meet customer demand for convenience and flexibility. During fiscal 2021, we expanded our Drive Up & Go curbside pickup service to over 2,000 locations and offer delivery services across more than 2,000 of our stores. In our delivery service, we have expanded first party locations, and continue to work with third party services to engage with customers on the platform of their choice. In addition to our continuing partnership with Instacart, we expanded our partnership with DoorDash to offer on-demand grocery delivery service where customers can receive a broad assortment in under one hour. We launched a similar partnership with Uber, where customers can order a full assortment of groceries on the Uber platform. We seek to tailor our offerings to local demographics and preferences of the markets in which we operate. Our Locally Great, Nationally Strong operating structure empowers decision making at the local level, which we believe better serves our customers and communities, while also providing the technology platforms, systems, analytics and buying power afforded by an organization with national scale.
Segments
We are engaged in the operation of food and drug retail stores that offer grocery products, general merchandise, health and beauty care products, pharmacy, fuel and other items and services in our stores or through digital channels. Our retail operating divisions are geographically based, have similar economic characteristics and similar expected long-term financial performance. Our operating segments and reporting units are made up of 12 divisions, which are reported in one reportable segment. Each reporting unit constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which management regularly reviews the operating results. Across all operating segments, the Company operates primarily one store format. Each division offers, through its stores and digital channels, the same general mix of products with similar pricing to similar categories of customers, has similar distribution methods, operates in similar regulatory environments and purchases merchandise from similar or the same vendors. 
Products
Our stores offer grocery products, general merchandise, health and beauty care products, pharmacy, fuel and other items and services. We are not dependent on any individual supplier; only one third-party supplier represented more than 5% of our sales for fiscal 2021.
Merchandising and Manufacturing
Our Own Brands portfolio provides high-quality products to our customers at a great value, offering nearly 14,000 unique items. The Own Brands portfolio includes but is not limited to the registered trademarks Signature SELECT®, O Organics®, Open Nature®, Signature Café®, Lucerne Dairy Farms®, Waterfront BISTRO® and Primo Taglio®, and the common law trademarks of Signature Care™, Signature Reserve™ and Value Corner™. Our Own Brands products resonate well with our shoppers, as evidenced by Own Brands sales of over $15.3 billion in fiscal 2021. Own Brands continues to deliver on innovation with 837 new items launched in fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2021, Own Brands was awarded four Private Label Manufacturing Association awards and won recognition from Store Brands Magazine for innovation in private brand marketing. 
As measured by units for fiscal 2021, 10.0% of our Own Brands products were manufactured in Company-owned facilities, and the remainder of our Own Brands merchandise was purchased from third parties. We closely monitor make-versus-buy decisions on internally sourced products to optimize their quality and profitability. In addition, we believe that our scale will provide opportunities to leverage our fixed manufacturing costs in order to drive innovation across our Own Brands portfolio. As of February 26, 2022, we operated 20 food production plants. These plants consisted of seven milk plants, four soft drink bottling plants, three bakery plants, two ice cream product plants, two grocery/prepared food plants, one ice plant and one soup plant.
Intellectual Property
Our banners, brand image and Own Brands portfolio are significant to our business strategy. We own numerous registered trademarks and service marks and seek to obtain and preserve intellectual property protection of our marks and to ensure that any third party uses are properly licensed.
Distribution
As of February 26, 2022, we operated 22 strategically located distribution centers, approximately 36% of which are owned or ground-leased. Our distribution centers collectively provide approximately 66% of all products to our retail operating areas.
Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing efforts involve collaboration between our national marketing and merchandising team and local divisions and stores. We augment the local division teams with corporate resources and are focused on providing expertise, sharing best practices and leveraging scale in partnership with leading consumer packaged goods vendors. Our corporate teams support divisions by providing strategic guidance in order to drive key areas of our business, including pharmacy, general merchandise and our Own Brands. Our local marketing teams set brand strategy and communicate brand messages through our integrated digital and physical marketing and advertising channels.
We devote significant resources to differentiating our banners in the local markets where we operate and invest in loyalty programs to drive traffic. Our local merchandising teams spend considerable time working with store directors to make sure we are satisfying consumer preferences. We also strive to achieve and maintain favorable recognition of our Own Brands offerings by marketing these offerings to consumers and enhancing value for consumers, particularly in respect of branded products.
We maintain price competitiveness through systematic, selective and thoughtful price investment to drive customer traffic and basket size. We also use our just for U loyalty program, including leveraging customer and transaction information with data driven analytics to provide both personalized deals and digital coupons, as well as gas and grocery rewards, to target promotional activity and improve our customers' experience. We have 29.9 million members currently enrolled in our loyalty program. We have achieved significant success with active participants in our just for U program, which drives higher sales and customer retention. We have recently deployed and are continuing to refine cloud-based enterprise solutions to quickly process proprietary customer, product and transaction data and efficiently provide our local managers with targeted marketing strategies for customers in their communities. In addition, we use data analytics to optimize shelf assortment and space in our stores by continually and systematically reviewing the performance of each product.
In digital, we are beginning to capitalize on our rich and proprietary data, recently launching the Albertsons Media Collective ("AMC") in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. AMC offers new and existing business partners a robust digital marketing platform that reaches our extensive customer network and leverages our strong market share, especially in the 68% of markets where we hold a #1 or #2 share position. We believe AMC will be a leading growth and profit driver over the next several years. 
Raw Materials
Various agricultural commodities constitute the principal raw materials used by us in the manufacture of our food products. Although historically raw materials for our products have not been in short supply and have been readily available, see "Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors" regarding the potential adverse impact on our results of operations due to the lack of, or reduced availability of, raw materials.
Environmental
Our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws, including those relating to waste management, air emissions and underground storage tanks. In addition, as an owner and operator of commercial real estate, we may be subject to liability under applicable environmental laws for clean-up of contamination at our facilities. Compliance with, and clean-up liability under, these laws has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, liquidity or operating results.
We work hard to maintain the highest standards of environmental stewardship (including procuring and offering sustainably sourced products). During fiscal 2021, we recycled more than 875 million pounds of cardboard and 25 million pounds of plastic bags and film from our operations and completed over 850 energy efficiency projects. Moreover, 100% of our Own Brands Waterfront BISTRO and Open Nature seafood is sourced to meet our Responsible Seafood Policy.
Human Capital
Serving approximately 34 million customers per week, our associates are a key component of our success. As one of the largest food and drug retailers in the U.S., we recognize that our ability to delight our customers lies in the engagement of our associates. To attract, develop and retain associates, we are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture, investing in talent development and supporting the personal health and well-being of associates and their families.
Employees
As of February 26, 2022, we employed approximately 290,000 associates, of which approximately 65% were part-time and approximately 200,000 associates were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We take pride in the 
long tenure of a significant number of our associates and during fiscal 2021, more than 61,000 of our associates celebrated at least 15 years of service, and more than 43,000 of them celebrated over 20 years of service.
In the face of a sustained labor shortage and increased turnover resulting in part from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to focus on recruiting, developing and retaining our associates by seeking to create a safe, equitable, diverse and inclusive workplace.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
During fiscal 2021, we continued our commitment to diverse representation across all levels of our workforce. We aspire to reflect the vibrant and thriving communities in which we live and work. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is a core element of our philosophy and we strive to embed it in our people practices. We believe in a diverse and inclusive workplace that fosters personal growth, develops talent and offers career opportunities. To enable an inclusive and welcoming culture among our associates, we support associate resource groups ("ARGs"). The ARGs, based on employee interests, are open to all associates in the corporate office and to the field leadership. Our current ARGs are the Women’s Inspiration and Inclusion Network ("WIIN"), the Hispanic Leadership Network, the Asian Network, the African American Leadership Council, the Pride Alliance, Green Team and the Veterans Associate Resource Group. We also have ARG mentorship programs which provides mentors and mentees with a great way to build new relationships and help sharpen their skills. We are also one of the first national grocery chains to join the Business Coalition for the Equality Act, a group of leading U.S. employers that support the federal Equality Act.
As part of our ongoing commitment, we have integrated Diversity, Equity & Inclusion ("DE&I") goals into the performance plans of our top leaders and during fiscal 2021 we have trained over 10,000 leaders through our "Leading with Inclusion" sessions. We continue to expand opportunities for our associates to learn more about DE&I, including facilitated discussions of leaders on how to be more inclusive, and bi-annual store and supply chain huddles to further embed DE&I into our frontline, complemented by online modules that are shared monthly. We have formed a National Diversity Council that is chaired by our CEO, to advance DE&I within our Company. In addition, each of our 12 operating divisions have Diversity Councils and we have individual councils for our Technology & Engineering, Digital & Consumer, and Supply Chain departments.
Talent, Learning & Development and Engagement
We are proud to offer our associates myriad opportunities to grow and advance their careers. We have a talent management process that is designed to enable us to identify and assess talent across the organization and provide equal and consistent opportunities for employees to develop their skills. Several levels of associates participate in our annual performance management process that includes goal setting, feedback, and development in order to support their personal growth and development. 
We actively engage associates across the organization to provide regular input. This includes focus groups, working directly with associates in our stores, ad hoc surveys, and our annual associate experience survey that is available to all associates. Notably, over 90% of our locations activated action plans shortly after they received their results. 
We offer formal and informal learning and development opportunities to all associates through synchronous, asynchronous, and hybrid experiences. These offerings include eLearning and on-demand content, virtual and in-person classes, on-the-job training, VR (virtual reality), mentoring programs and more. By offering differentiated learning solutions, we meet our associates where they are in their development to provide the support they need to perform in their current roles and prepare for future opportunities. During fiscal 2021, our in-store and office associates together completed more than 5 million courses through various platforms. We also launched two enterprise-wide programs that focus on enhancing the capabilities of our leaders. First, our Assistant Store Directors Training program is a 10-week immersive program that prepares high potential frontline supervisors for the next 
step in their career through business- and industry-specific experiential learning. Second, our Foundational Leadership Skills curriculum was designed for all people leaders to develop their leadership skills through self-study and instructor-led workshops.
We have also partnered with industry associations to provide access to relevant continuing retail education opportunities through colleges around the country. In terms of engagement, we hold regular Town Hall meetings where any employee can ask questions of executives and make their voice heard.
Well-Being
We invest in our associates by offering competitive wages and job-appropriate compensation including cash-based performance bonus awards, equity-based compensation awards as well as a broad range of benefits that vary based on the nature of the job and title, customary local practices and statutory requirements. The benefits we offer include comprehensive, accessible, and affordable healthcare coverage, as well as paid time off, flexible work schedules, family leave, associate assistance programs and a 401(k) retirement savings and investment plan with Company matching, subject to eligibility. We seek to manage our collective bargaining agreements through active negotiations with union officials in order to best provide our employees fair wages, comprehensive retirement packages and other benefits. We aspire to provide a safe, open and accountable work environment and we also provide a hotline for all associates to report workplace concerns and violations. 
In addition to caring for the well-being of our associates, we seek to support the communities we serve. During fiscal 2021, along with the Albertsons Companies Foundation, we contributed almost $200 million in food and financial support, including approximately $40 million through our Nourishing Neighbors program to ensure those living in our communities have enough to eat. We have continued to partner with the Department of Health and Human Services and local health authorities to administer COVID-19 vaccines to our local communities and have administered more than 12 million doses.
Seasonality
Our business is generally not seasonal in nature, but a larger share of annual revenues may be generated in November and December due to the major holidays.
Competitive Environment
The food and drug retail industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors that affect our business are location, quality, price, service, selection, convenience and condition of assets such as our stores. The operating environment for the food and drug retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense competition, aggressive expansion, increasing specialization of retail and digital formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and consolidation.
We face intense competition from other food and/or drug retailers, supercenters, club stores, online retailers, specialty and niche supermarkets, "limited assortment" stores, drug stores, general merchandisers, wholesale stores, discount stores, convenience stores, natural food stores, farmers' markets, local chains and stand-alone stores that cater to the individual cultural preferences of specific neighborhoods, restaurants and a growing number of internet-based home delivery and meal solution companies. We and our competitors engage in price and non-price competition which, from time to time, has adversely affected our operating margins.
