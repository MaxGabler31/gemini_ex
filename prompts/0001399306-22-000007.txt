ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview
 
BrewBilt Brewing Company (formerly Simlatus Corporation) is the parent company of wholly-owned subsidiaries Satel Group Inc. and BrewBilt Brewing LLC.
 
BrewBilt Brewing is an independent craft beer manufacturer offering its own line of lagers and ales with a particular focus on traditional European lagers. BrewBilt Brewing will also offer contract brewing services for other breweries in need of additional capacity as well as private label ales for restaurants and bars desiring their own house beer.
 
Satel Group is the premier provider of DirecTV to high-rise apartments, condominiums and large commercial office buildings in the San Francisco metropolitan area and offers Internet services across the Bay Area.
 
BrewBilt Brewing LLC is the entity pursuing the Type 23 Small Beer Manufacturer license from the California Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (ABC). We expect this license to be issued once brewery construction is nearing completion. BrewBilt Brewing LLC has already received our Brewers Notice from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).
 
BrewBilt Brewing Company works closely with BrewBilt Manufacturing Inc., which is also located in Grass Valley, California and led by CEO Jef Lewis. BrewBilt Manufacturing custom designs and handcrafts brewing and fermentation equipment and will supply all necessary equipment to BrewBilt Brewing for our craft beer production.

BrewBilt Brewings ties with BrewBilt Manufacturing provide strong relationships with local suppliers of raw materials, equipment and services in California, an aggressive referral network of satisfied customers nationwide, and an Advisory Board consisting of successful business leaders who provide valuable product feedback and business expertise to management. The craft brewing and spirits industries continue to grow worldwide. California is where American craft brewing began and now has over 950 operating breweries – being centrally located in this booming market was a large draw for BrewBilt Brewing to locate its facility in the Sierra foothills.
 
In March of 2021, BrewBilt Brewing began design and permitting for the construction of its brewing facility in Grass Valley, California. This facility was leased by BrewBilt and is being upgraded with substantial tenant improvements to include a 20 BBL brewhouse, 20 and 40 BBL fermentation tanks, cold-storage space, and a state-of-the-art canning line. In July of 2021, BrewBilt took the opportunity to expand again by leasing additional space adjacent to the original lease.
 

 Competition and Marketing
 
As a craft brewery with plans to distribute statewide (and beyond) BrewBilt Brewing faces competition from the hundreds of existing craft breweries in California and thousands nationwide.
 
Despite uncertainty in the market, theres an all-time high of 8,764 craft breweries, suggesting that the craft brewing industry is poised to rebound from last years devastating global pandemic that saw beer volume, retail dollars and jobs drop precipitously.
 
2020 was obviously a challenging year for many small brewers, but also one that proved their resilient and entrepreneurial nature, said Bart Watson, chief economist of the Brewers Association (BA), in a statement. In a year where U.S. draught sales were down more than 40%, small brewers found new ways to connect with their customers and keep their businesses running.
 
Brian Sudano, managing partner at Beverage Marketing Corporation (BMC), New York, concurs that the craft beer industry was disproportionately impacted by the pandemic because of the near shutdown of its entire on-premise business including taprooms.
 
As the market has slowly opened up, craft beer has returned to growth but has not recovered totally to where it would be if the pandemic did not take place. However, it is slowly returning to pre-pandemic growth levels, Sudano says. In 2020, craft beer declined approximately 6%, total beer was flat and FMBs including hard seltzer grew 67%. For 2021, craft accelerated to high single digit growth, FMBs including hard seltzer in mid-teens, and total beer to decline low single digits.

For the 52 weeks ending Sept. 5, beer sales in multi-outlets were $43.8 billion, a 3% year-over-year (YoY) increase, according to data from Information Resources Inc. (IRI), Chicago. Craft beer generated dollar sales were slightly north of $5 billion, a 1.4% increase, IRI data shows.
 
During the same timeframe, beer and craft beer cases sales numbers were slightly down at 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively, with sales in excess of 1.6 billion for beer overall and 128.8 million for craft beer, according to IRI data.
 
More than a year and a half later, the BAs Watson is cautiously optimistic about the state of the craft beer industry.
 
The rough version is that craft brewers appear to have made up about half of their volume lost in 2020 (versus 2019) in the first half of 2021, he explains. The second quarter was stronger than the first, and while its probably unlikely craft will fully get back to 2019 volume levels, its probably going to get close, barring further economic and consumer confidence setbacks due to the delta variant.
 
Craft brewers have long been innovative, and its tougher than ever to summarize what they are doing, Watson explains. Within beer, we are seeing continued growth in IPAs, but also in lower ABV beers (including lagers and other low ABV ales), and fuller flavored but non-hoppy styles such as sours or fruit beers.
 
In its September Breweries in the US report, Los Angeles-based IBISWorld notes that the $7.3 billion craft beer industry has medium revenue volatility, with annual growth down 1.8%, and a profit margin of $305.7 million for the five-year period through 2021.
 
When it comes to craft beer production, India pale ales (IPAs) are No. 1 at 30.2%. Rounding out the list are Belgian witbiers, 23.3%; seasonal, 10.5%; lagers, 9.1%; pale ales, 7.7%; and amber ales, 5.5%.
 
Similarly, IRIs Client Insights Consultant Cara Piotrowski says the top-selling craft beers are IPAs, wheat ales, seasonals, pilsners/pale lagers, amber/dark lagers and bocks. IPAs continue to drive most growth with wild/sour ales and Belgian ales also contributing to growth from a style perspective, she adds.
 
When comparing year to date (YTD) case sales pre-pandemic versus 2019 YTD for the week ending Sept. 26, craft beer volume grew 7.1%, signaling a recovery.
 
From a pre-pandemic perspective, beer YTD is up 6.5% in case volume; craft, is up 7.1% and FMBs are up 13.6%. The trends are better if we look at the latest 52-week period versus two years ago: beer, up 7.3%; craft, up 8.5%; and FMBs, up 14%.
 
IBISWorlds September Breweries in the US report states, Over the five years to 2026, the industry is anticipated to fully rebound from the setbacks incurred amid the COVID-19 pandemic and experience sustained growth. Continual rises in expenditures on alcoholic beverages and decreases in excise taxes on beer will likely further entice prospective operators to try their hand in the industry. Ultimately, industry revenue is forecast to rise an annualized 2.4% to $8.2 billion over the five years to 2026.
 
The craft beer industry is becoming saturated with full bodied ales with prominent hop and/or fruit flavors. As the craft beer market matures and the novelty of these styles wane, drinkers are demanding more refreshing, lower alcohol brews. Consumer demand for lighter bodied lagers has steadily increased over the last couple years (9.5% growth in 2021), and BrewBilt Brewing is distinguishing itself and meeting that demand with its modern execution of traditional styles using local ingredients processed with industry-leading equipment and techniques.
 
BrewBilt is also setting itself apart with its contract brewing services. Contract brewing, once stigmatized in the industry, is now seen as an attractive option for existing breweries in need of additional capacity as well as new breweries looking to avoid the significant startup costs associated with a lease and brewing equipment. Contract brewing is currently only 1.3% of US beer production volume, so as both new and established breweries turn to this option, BrewBilt will be well poised to meet the demand without significant competition.

Satel Group Inc., the global Internet audience continues to grow steadily, with the worldwide base of broadband Internet users (including fixed and wireless) in the 3.2 billion range as 2016 began. This vast base of high-speed Internet users encourages businesses to innovate in order to offer an ever-evolving array of online services. Sectors that are growing very rapidly online include the sale of entertainment products, event tickets, travel, apparel, and consumer electronics.
 
Although telecom companies provide voice and data services to consumers and businesses, the nature of these services differs significantly between the two customer segments. While residential customers mainly use wireless services, businesses use wire line to get high-capacity broadband and advanced communications services. Also, telecom companies rent their facilities or networks—providing wholesale data and communication access—to other carriers of communication services.
 
Key companies in the US include AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ), and Sprint (S) which are the large integrated, publicly trade telecom companies that provide wireless and wire line services, while T-Mobile (TMUS) is a listed national wireless operator. Wire line players—like CenturyLink (CTL), Frontier Communications (FTR), and Windstream Holdings (WIN)—are some of the other key regional telecom companies in the US. A wire line network includes interlinked connection and redistribution systems that supports information—like voice and data—to travel electronically. Traditional, local, and long distance telephone systems that supported voice calls, messaging, and fax were the primary wire line services that transmitted services over a network of copper wires and switches. The wires and switches connected calls between users mostly using a copper infrastructure connecting traditional landlines and pay phones. Now, with the backbone of the network being fiber optics, they support a broadband network capable of delivering VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), Internet, TV services, and managed private communications. Broadband infrastructure is recognized as a critical resource for economic development. Most countries, across the globe have strategic plans in place—like the National Broadband Plan—to expand and develop their Broadband network to support a broad range of enhanced communications and entertainment services.
 
The companys internet service is less expensive than AT&T, Google, and Comcast, which currently offer Gigabit‟ as their top Internet service, while most customers buy a much slower and less expensive service under a 100 MB. Satels application of HPNA technology using coaxial cable to deliver Internet, provides download speeds of 200Mb-500Mb, with unlimited downloads for a cost less than those fees charged by other carriers for the same speeds. The company believes that there is a good and marketable monthly Internet service in the $40-$45 range. Satel can also combine local, off air channels, whereas the other OTT providers do not.
 
We will continue to market our product to new building owners and management companies using our direct B2B campaign as well as to contact those architects, engineering firms and other decision makers involved with new high rise construction in the Bay Area. Our CEO, Richard Hylen, has established long-term relationships with owners, builders, management companies, managers, and other service providers to introduce our product and create our initial sales contact. Our CEO has extensive experience in marketing both entertainment and Internet services and believes that the marketing of our products directly to consumers would not have the same potential for increased sales that it would have without the ongoing support of established building managers.
