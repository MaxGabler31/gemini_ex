Our Market Opportunity
KeyW solutions and products focus on serving IC customers including FBI, DHS, NSA, NGA, AGC, and other agencies within the IC and DoD. In addition, we provide products and services to U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, and foreign allies.
We believe that KeyW’s capabilities and offerings are well-aligned with national security priorities, and we have structured our strategic business development efforts to target these opportunities. The current Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2019 budget requests approximately $15 billion in cybersecurity funding, and we believe that the total addressable DoD information technology, or IT, budget is approximately $15 billion for GFY 2019. Additionally, approximately $8.5 billion of the GFY 2019 budget request is earmarked for the DoD’s cyberspace operations, an increase of approximately $0.3 billion over GFY 2018. The increase is largely associated with anticipated growth in the DoD’s Cyber Mission Forces and other defensive and offensive cyberspace activities. The new budget request also calls for investing another $13.7 billion in science and technology for further innovation and new and advanced capabilities, including capabilities in cyberspace, space, and artificial intelligence - many of KeyW’s technology initiative areas.
Intelligence
The IC consists of 17 agencies and organizations, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), within the Executive Branch that work both independently and collaboratively to gather and analyze the intelligence necessary to conduct foreign relations and national security activities. The rapid pace of technological innovation and evolution of the security threat environment physical and digital requires highly specialized service providers who can ensure the IC and DoD maintain their technology leadership position to serve the security interests of the United States. To maintain superiority over adversaries, there 
3

is strong demand from the IC and DoD for cutting-edge technologies in areas such as signal processing and cyber and intelligence analysis and operations.
The IC represents an approximately $81.1 billion addressable market in GFY 2019. The intelligence budget is divided between the National Intelligence Program (NIP), managed by the ODNI, and the Military Intelligence Program, managed by the Secretary of Defense. The NIP, which supports agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Office, the NSA, and the Central Intelligence Agency, represents an approximately $59.9 billion annual budget in GFY 2019 and has grown at a compounded annual rate of approximately 2% since 2009, despite significant government budgetary pressures. The positive budgetary trends are driven by the need to produce actionable intelligence to combat the evolving asymmetric and widely distributed threat landscape. Growth is expected to continue, driven by the extreme demands on legacy, non-standardized infrastructure and emergence of new technologies to collect, transport and store, analyze, and operate an increasing amount of data.
Funding areas of the NIP focus on maintaining technological advancement and superiority in the following areas:

• | Sustaining key investments to strengthen intelligence collection and critical operational capabilities supporting counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and counterproliferation;


• | Protecting the IC’s core mission areas and maintaining global coverage to remain vigilant against emerging threats;


• | Promoting increased intelligence sharing and advancing IC integration through continued investment in enterprise-wide capabilities and use of cloud technology to facilitate greater efficiency and improve the safeguarding of information across the intelligence information environment; and


• | Identifying resources for strategic priorities, including advanced technology to improve strategic warning, evolved collection and exploitation capabilities, and increased resiliency.

Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is receiving increased attention and budget funding at a time when there are widespread and effective threats that demonstrate the vulnerability of U.S. public and private data and communications networks. Recent headlines highlighting high-profile cases of unauthorized access, digital espionage, identity theft, malicious code, and other cyber-crimes in both public and private sectors have reinforced the need for a more robust cybersecurity infrastructure. An increase in hacking attacks on key national security infrastructure systems, such as the DoD computer system, has heightened the need for improved threat protection. Additionally, the expansion of anti-terrorism efforts to cyberspace highlights the need for improved global cyber coordination and security measures.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths will allow us to take advantage of the trends in our industry:
Ability to develop, field, and operate end-to-end intelligence solutions. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic technology development, KeyW has assembled a collection of capabilities that when combined, are capable of supporting our customers' end-to-end intelligence mission in the space, airborne, ground and cyber domains. We intend to leverage these customer proven capabilities to extend our market penetration to other organizations and agencies, foreign and domestic, and to drive organic growth.
ISR sensor development and, rapid deployment and sustainment of collection platforms. Our highly customized, integrated collection solutions are lower cost than traditional ISR platforms and are complemented by ongoing sustainment and logistics support of the collection platforms. We rapidly deploy solutions tailored to meet the most urgent requirements for ISR imagery in support of tactical missions and rapid mapping of large areas in some of the world's most challenging locations, thus placing us at the center of the need for actionable intelligence.
Focus on core cyber superiority, geospatial intelligence and intelligence strengths. We focus on delivering cyber superiority, geospatial intelligence and intelligence support to the IC. We deliver a full range of cyber engineering services and solutions, geospatial intelligence services and solutions and cyber intelligence products. Mastering cyberspace and thereby attaining cyber superiority is a core mission of the IC. We believe that our focus gives our customers faster and more innovative solutions than those offered by our competitors.
4

Agile intelligence, cybersecurity and cyber age operations expertise. We have significant experience in building signal and information processing solutions and cybersecurity, cyber superiority, and geospatial intelligence solutions, using agile methodologies for the IC to support mission-critical activities and responses to complex national security problems. Our team has established a strong reputation for responding rapidly to customer requirements and for partnering with our customers to identify and define these requirements. The constant and evolving threat environment has put enormous pressure on the IC to respond quickly. We believe that we have a culture of innovation and agility that allows us to respond more quickly and with greater impact than other organizations.
Skilled employees with high-level security clearances. As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,790 employees. Approximately 86% of our employees have U.S. Government security clearances, with approximately 75% holding top secret or higher clearance. This concentration of highly skilled and cleared personnel allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements and gives us ongoing insight into our customers’ toughest national security problems. The requirement for these clearances and the time and process required to attain them are significant barriers to entering our markets.
Our Strategy
Our objective is to continue growing our business by providing affordable, advanced engineering and technology solutions for complex challenges such as preventing cyber threats, transforming data into intelligence and combating global terrorism, selling our proven capabilities and innovations to government intelligence, defense, and other federal, state, and local government customers. Key elements of our strategy to accomplish our continued growth objective include:
Leveraging IC experience in certain agencies to address new growth markets in the intelligence, cyber, and counterterrorism communities. KeyW now serves the majority of the agencies in the IC. A key growth strategy is to leverage the unique capabilities we have developed in our core customers to expand into the agencies where KeyW does not have a significant presence. We believe the capabilities we have developed for current customers will be attractive to other members of the IC, enabling a significant growth opportunity for KeyW. To expand our IC presence, we have invested in building a best-in-class business development team with a proven capability of penetrating new customer agencies and winning large new prime contracts.
Building and leveraging our research and development efforts. We intend to continue utilizing company and customer-funded research and development to develop technologies, products, and solutions that have significant potential for near-term as well as long-term value in the markets we serve. We will continue to use intellectual property that we create internally or license from other companies in the areas of network traffic intelligence, cybersecurity, cyber intelligence and geospatial intelligence to build products and solutions to further penetrate the intelligence and defense market.
Competition
We sell our services and products primarily to the intelligence, cyber, space, and counter terrorism communities. The level of security clearances required for this work limits the range of competitors for customers in these communities. In addition, the number of competitors is limited even further by the level of technical expertise required to deliver products and services to our government customers. We compete either as prime contractor or as a subcontractor, depending on the requirements and scope of the project.
Our competitors include both large companies that offer a broad range of services and capabilities and smaller boutique organizations that are highly focused on particular capabilities, solutions, and customers. Our larger competitors include divisions of large defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing Company and Northrop Grumman Corporation. We also face competition from a number of large, well-established government contractors such as Leidos Inc., Booz Allen Hamilton Corporation, CACI International Inc., and others. The smaller competitors are generally privately held corporations with strong capabilities in delivering specific elements of a solution for a narrow range of customers. See “Risk Factors” for a description of the various risks we may face from our competitors.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing capabilities support modest volume product manufacturing consistent with our customers' needs for products that evolve rapidly and on a regular basis. We use a combination of in-house resources and contract manufacturing support provided by third parties. We believe that this approach to our manufacturing needs allows us to carefully manage capital investment while maintaining our ability to meet surges in the volume of customer requirements.
5

Research and Development
Innovation is an important part of our business model. We look for opportunities to create long-term growth, on a sole-source basis, by leveraging our in-depth knowledge of our customers’ missions and needs, and our ability to use Internal Research and Development (IR&D). Our product and solutions business has evolved through a combination of customer development and IR&D. We frequently develop a core capability or technology and then customize this capability or technology to meet specific customer requirements.
Our Research and Development (R&D) consists of IR&D that is an allowable expense under U.S. Government contracts and R&D that is performed at our expense. Spending on R&D activities may vary, depending on the opportunities that we see and customer requirements. R&D costs totaled $1.8 million, $3.7 million and $4.6 million for years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a percent of revenue R&D was 0.4%, 0.8% and 1.6% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Intellectual Property
We own eight patents and have one pending patent application. We have 11 federally registered trademarks, two pending federal trademark registration applications, and six registered copyrights. As we develop intellectual property, we determine, with the support of outside patent counsel, the best manner to protect it, whether through patent, through copyright, or as a trade secret. When we acquire companies that have developed intellectual property and have patents pending, we determine, with the support of outside patent counsel, whether we need to continue pursuing the pending patent applications. With regard to several of our products, we have developed intellectual property that we are protecting as trade secrets. We have made this determination based on the costs and risks involved, as well as the pace at which changes are being made to the products. As we build our solutions and products, we also make use of third-party intellectual property for which we purchase licenses, as necessary. We integrate technology, including hardware and software, based on designs and architectures that we develop with our customers.
Regulatory Matters
We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which mandates uniform policies and procedures for U.S. Government acquisitions and purchased services, governs the majority of our contracts. Individual agencies also have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the FAR.
Other federal regulations require certification and disclosure of cost or pricing data in connection with contract negotiations for certain types of contracts; define allowable and unallowable costs; govern reimbursement rights under cost-based contracts; and restrict the use, dissemination, and exportation of products and information classified for national security purposes.
A substantial portion of the Company’s revenue and costs are generated from contracts with the U.S. Government that are subject to audit by the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). U.S. Agencies, including the DCAA, the Defense Contract Management Agency, and other various agencies, routinely audit contract cost and allocated indirect cost for compliance with federal procurement regulations, Cost Accounting Standards, and in accordance with contract specific terms and conditions. The DCAA has audited the incurred cost submissions of the Company through December 31, 2015. The results of such audits are not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, and as of December 31, 2018 the Company believes it has adequately reserved for potential adjustments from audits or review of contract costs.
Our federal government business is also subject to laws, regulations, and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of classified information and, under U.S. export control laws, the export of certain products and technical data.
Additionally, federal government contracts, by their terms, generally can be terminated at any time by the federal government, without cause, for the convenience of the federal government. If a federal government contract is so terminated, we would be entitled to receive compensation for the services provided and costs incurred through the time of termination, plus settlement expenses and a negotiated amount of profit. Federal government contractors who fail to comply with applicable U.S. Government procurement-related statutes and regulations may be subject to potential contract termination, suspension and debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government, or other remedies. See “Risk Factors” for a description of the various risks we may face regarding laws and regulations relating to U.S. Government contracts.
U.S. Federal Government Contracts
We derive substantially all our revenue from U.S. Government customers. In fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, we generated approximately 95%, 94% and 94%, respectively, of our total revenue from contracts where the end customer was the U.S. Government, which has a highly structured and regulated competitive procurement process. Our intelligence and defense customers 
6

typically exercise independent contracting authority and do not use General Services Administration (GSA) or other government-wide acquisition contracts to obtain our services or products.
Subcontracts accounted for approximately 28% of our revenue in 2018, and prime contracts accounted for 72%. In 2017 subcontracts accounted for approximately 36% of our revenue and prime contracts accounted for approximately 64% of our revenue. Our prime contracts have been awarded as both sole-source and competitive awards; our subcontracts have been awarded competitively from prime contractors.
Sole-source award contracts
Under a sole-source award contract, the purchase of goods or services is made from a single source without competitive bidding. It is awarded usually, but not always, by a federal government agency after soliciting and negotiating with only one firm. These contracts can be negotiated much more quickly than a typical competitive contract, providing there is adequate demonstration of both need and the likelihood that any attempt to obtain bids would only result in one person or company able to meet the need. Urgency is often the rationale for sole-source contracts. Sole-source contracts may be awarded based on a variety of different compensation models, including firm-fixed price (FFP), time-and-materials (T&M), cost-plus-fixed-fee, or level-of-effort contracts based on negotiations, risk, and cost uncertainty.
Single award contracts
Under single award contracts with defined statements of work, a federal government agency solicits, qualifies, and then requests proposals from interested contractors. The agency then evaluates the bids and typically awards the contract to a single contractor for a specified service or product.
Multiple award contracts
Under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, a federal government agency can form preferred provider relationships with one or more contractors. This category includes agency-specific ID/IQ contracts; blanket purchase agreements; government-wide acquisition contracts (GWACs); and GSA schedule contracts. These umbrella contracts, often referred to as vehicles, outline the basic terms and conditions under which federal government agencies may order services. ID/IQ contracts are typically managed by one sponsoring agency, and they may be either for the use of a specific agency or available for use by any other agency of the federal government. ID/IQ contracts available for use by any agency of the federal government are commonly referred to as GWACs.
Contractors within the industry compete to be pre-selected to perform work under an ID/IQ contract. An ordering agency then issues delivery orders, commonly known as task orders, for services to be performed under the contract. If the ID/IQ contract has a single prime contractor, only that contractor may be awarded delivery orders. If the contract has multiple prime contractors, the award of each delivery order typically will be competitively determined among the pre-selected contractors.
GSA schedules are listings of services and products, along with their respective prices, offered by federal government contractors. The schedules are negotiated and maintained by the GSA for use by any federal agency or other authorized entity, including state and local governments. When an agency selects services or products under a GSA schedule contract, the competitive process is limited to qualified GSA schedule contractors.
Contract types
We generate revenue under various types of contracts, which include T&M, fixed-price-level-of-effort, FFP, and cost reimbursable contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we derived revenue from such contracts on an actual basis as follows:

 | Year ended December 31, 2018
Contract Type | (in millions) | | (percentage) | 
Time & Materials and Fixed-Price-Level-of-Effort | $ | 175.0 | | 34.5 | %
Firm-Fixed-Price | 125.9 | | 24.9 | % 
Cost Reimbursement | 205.9 | | 40.6 | % 

7


 | Year ended December 31, 2017
Contract Type | (in millions) | | (percentage) | 
Time & Materials and Fixed-Price-Level-of-Effort | $ | 167.8 | | 38.0 | %
Firm-Fixed-Price | 102.1 | | 23.1 | % 
Cost Reimbursement | 171.7 | | 38.9 | % 


 | Year ended December 31, 2016
Contract Type | (in millions) | | (percentage) | 
Time & Materials and Fixed-Price-Level-of-Effort | $ | 114.8 | | 39.9 | %
Firm-Fixed-Price | 80.7 | | 28.0 | % 
Cost Reimbursement | 92.5 | | 32.1 | % 

Time-and-materials contracts. Under a T&M contract, we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and out-of-pocket expenses. To the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates among various labor categories provided in the contract, we will generate profit or we could incur a loss.
Fixed-price-level-of-effort contracts. Fixed-price-level-of-effort contracts are substantially like T&M contracts except that they require a specified level of effort over a stated period of time.
Firm-fixed-price contracts. FFP contracts provide for a fixed price for specified products, systems and/or services. If actual costs vary from planned costs on an FFP contract, we generate more or less than the planned amount of profit and may even incur a loss. 
Cost reimbursable contracts. Cost reimbursable contracts provide for reimbursement of our direct contract costs and allowable and allocable indirect costs, plus a fee.
Backlog
We define backlog to include both funded and unfunded orders for products and services under existing signed contracts, assuming the exercise of all options relating to those contracts, less the amount of revenue we have previously recognized under those contracts. We define funded backlog as the portion of backlog for which funding currently is appropriated and obligated to us under a contract or other authorization for payment signed by an authorized purchasing authority. Unfunded backlog includes all contract options exercised and unexercised that have been priced but not funded. 
As of December 31, 2018, our total backlog was $1,092 million, of which $227 million was funded and $865 million was unfunded. As of December 31, 2017, our total backlog was $1,189 million, of which $138 million was funded and $1,051 million was unfunded. 
Total backlog may fluctuate from period to period depending on our success rate in winning contracts and the timing of contract awards, renewals, modifications and cancellations. We expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenue within the next 12 months. However, the U.S. Government may terminate any contract at any time.
Customers
We derive substantially all of our revenue from continuing operations from contracts with U.S. Government agencies involved with national security missions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenue from continuing operations was derived 30% from contracts with the NSA; 20% from contracts with the U.S. Army; 23% from contracts with other elements of the DoD excluding the NSA and the U.S. Army (none of which individually were greater than 10% of our 2018 revenue from continuing operations); 14% from contracts with the FBI; 9% from work for other major intelligence agencies and other intelligence, defense, homeland security and other U.S. Government agencies and law enforcement organizations and 5% from commercial and international customers. 
Long-term relationships between intelligence customers and contractors develop because of the high level of security clearances required to work on projects and unique technical requirements of intelligence customers. For example, members of our team have been working closely with the NSA for over 30 years, during which time they have completed numerous projects with the NSA.
