ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
We are a biotechnology company focused on developing personalized immune therapies for cancer. We have developed a platform technology, DCVax®, which uses activated dendritic cells to mobilize a patient’s own immune system to attack their cancer.
Our lead product, DCVax®-L, is designed to treat solid tumor cancers in which the tumor can be surgically removed. We have completed a 331-patient international Phase III trial of DCVax-L for Glioblastoma multiforme brain cancer (GBM). As previously reported, the data collection and confirmation process was conducted by the independent contract research organization (CRO) who managed the trial and by other independent service firms. On October 5, 2020, the Company announced that Data Lock for the Phase III trial had been reached, and that a series of steps and processes would follow. These processes included data validation, analyses of the data by independent statisticians, preparations by the statisticians of summaries of the Trial results for review by the Company, the Principal Investigator, the Steering Committee of the Trial, the Scientific Advisory Board, and a panel of independent brain cancer experts, in preparation for publication in a scientific journal and public announcement. This series of processes is under way. It is anticipated that public announcement will follow these processes.
As also previously reported, coronavirus-related difficulties have impacted most aspects of the process, especially with the successive waves of COVID cases in many areas. The independent service firms have had limited capacity, and restrictions on operations. Key experts at certain specialized service providers have been unavailable for periods of time. Other experts have gone on extended leave. Clinical trial site personnel have been unavailable due to being reassigned for COVID, and the limited site personnel have had to work under restrictions. Committee processes and regulatory processes have been similarly focused on COVID matters and delayed on other matters. Firms such as the ones storing the Phase III trial tissue samples that are needed for certain analyses, and the firms conducting the analyses, continue to have only limited operations. Even logistical matters such as the shipping of materials have been, and continue to be, subjected to substantial difficulties and delays.

On August 28, 2020, we acquired Flaskworks, LLC (“Flaskworks”), a company that has developed a system designed to close and automate the manufacturing of cell therapy products such as DCVax®. We acquired 100% of the ownership, and Flaskworks became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Flaskworks was previously owned by its technical founders and Corning Inc. The technical team from Flaskworks joined us as part of the Acquisition. It is anticipated that the Flaskworks system will enable substantial scale-up of production volumes of DCVax products and substantial reduction of production costs. Our buildout of the Sawston, UK facility has been designed to proceed in phases, as modules, both for efficiency in the timing of capital costs and to allow flexibility in operations and usage. We anticipate that implementation of the Flaskworks system will enable certain phases of the buildout to be simplified and streamlined. For further details on the financial aspects of the acquisition, please see Item 8 Note 5 below.
Our second product, DCVax®-Direct, is designed to treat inoperable solid tumors. A 40-patient Phase I trial has been completed, and included treatment of a diverse range of more than a dozen types of cancers. We plan to work on preparations for Phase II trials of DCVax-Direct as resources permit.
The DCVax Technology
Our platform technology, DCVax, is a personalized immune therapy that uses a patient’s own dendritic cells, or DCs, the master cells of the immune system, as the therapeutic agent. The patient’s DCs are obtained through a blood draw, or leukapheresis. The DCs are then activated and loaded with biomarkers (“antigens”) from the patient’s own tumor. For DCVax-L, the antigen loading process takes place during the manufacturing of the product. For DCVax-Direct, the antigen loading process takes place in situ in the tumor after the product is directly injected into the patient’s inoperable tumor. The loading of antigens into the DCs “educates” the DCs about what the immune system needs to target.
Manufacturing of DCVax
We use a batch manufacturing technology for our DCVax products, and we believe this manufacturing approach is a key part of the practicality of our product and its economic feasibility. Generally, we are able to produce enough doses for the patient’s treatment regimen through just one manufacturing process. When a batch of DCVax product has been made, we then cryopreserve it.
Both of these technologies, the personalized batch manufacturing for each patient and the cryopreservation, are essential elements of our manufacturing model and product economics. Together, they enable us to usually incur the high costs of manufacturing just one time for each patient, and then store the multi-year or multi-dose quantity of product, frozen, in single doses. This makes DCVax effectively an “off the shelf” product for the patient after the initial manufacturing, even though it is personalized, and we anticipate that this will enable the pricing of DCVax to be in line with other new cancer drugs. We also believe that both economies of scale and automation will further enhance the product economics. The manufacturing process today is also rapid: about 8 days for DCVax-L, and 7 days for DCVax-Direct, followed by quality control and release testing (including a sterility test that may take a couple of weeks).
As previously reported, we have been developing a manufacturing facility in Sawston, U.K. To date, our production of dendritic cell vaccine products in the UK has been taking place in a GMP (clean room) facility in London, with a capacity of about 4 - 6 patients per month. The Sawston facility contains a total of 88,345 square feet on two floors. The initial production capacity comprises two manufacturing suites, occupying approximately 4,400 square feet on the ground floor. These two suites, together with some additional support and storage space, have anticipated potential capacity to produce dendritic cell vaccines for about 40 to 45 patients per month, or approximately 450 to 500 patients annually. The buildout of Phase 1A of the facility was completed in Q4 2020.
During 2021, work continued for technology transfer from the London facility to the Sawston facility, recruitment of contract technical personnel for Sawston, development of some 1,000 regulatory documents for operations in the Sawston facility, and applications to both the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) and the MHRA for inspections of the Sawston facility and its operations, and issuance of licenses for manufacturing in the facility. These applications and inspections were successfully completed. The HTA license was issued in October 2021 and the MHRA license was issued in December 2021. Following some required validation work after the licenses were issued, production of DCVax-L began this month.

The initial production capacity will occupy only a small fraction of the total space in the Sawston facility. In light of this, and in light of our obligation in connection with the buildout loan from the Cambridge development authority to make the Sawston facility benefit the regional business ecosystem and not just us, on December 31, 2021 we entered into a sub-lease for a small portion of the space to our contract manufacturer, Advent BioServices. For further details, please see Note 10 below. It is anticipated that, as and when feasible, the subleased space may enable some production of third party cell therapy products Such production of other products will fulfill the loan-related commitment to the Cambridge authority, will help support the capital-intensive Sawston facility costs and, in light of the growing demand for cell therapy manufacturing capacity, could substantially increase the asset value of the Sawston facility.
All of the development activities for the Sawston facility have been carried out or managed by Advent BioServices, who is also the contract operator of the facility.
Intellectual Property and Orphan Drug Designation
We have an integrated strategy for protection of our technology through both patents and other mechanisms, such as Orphan Drug status. As of December 31, 2021, we have 204 issued patents and 59 pending patent applications worldwide, grouped into 11 patent families. Of these, 200 issued patents and 47 pending patent applications directly relate to our DCVax products. In the United States and Europe, some of our patents and applications relate to compositions and the use of products, while other patents and applications relate to other aspects such as manufacturing and quality control. For example, in the United States, we have seven issued and five pending patent applications that relate to the composition and/or use of our DCVax products. We also have other U.S patents and applications that cover, among other things, quality control for DCVax and an automated system which we believe will help enable the scale-up of production for large numbers of patients on a cost-effective basis. Similarly, in Europe, we have seven patents issued by and eight pending patent applications with the European Patent Office ("EPO") that cover our DCVax products, and other patents and applications that cover aspects such as manufacturing and quality control, and the automated system. In Japan, we have nine issued patents and three pending patent applications relating to our DCVax products, as well as manufacturing related patents. Patents have been granted or are pending in other foreign jurisdictions which may be potential future markets for our DCVax products.
During 2021, seven new patents were issued to us as part of our worldwide patent portfolio. The newly issued patents cover methods for manufacturing dendritic cells related to our DCVax products, as well as encompassing certain methods of use and compositions that may be potential future markets for related DCVax products. 
Additionally, with the acquisition of Flaskworks, we gained ownership of a portfolio of patents and patent applications which include those held by Flaskworks as well as patents and patent applications exclusively licensed by Flaskworks from Northeastern University. The portfolio includes a total of thirteen patent families, with issued patents and pending applications worldwide. Collectively these patents and patent applications cover key aspects of the design and function of automated cell culture systems.
During 2020, three new patents were issued to us as part of our worldwide patent portfolio. The newly issued patents cover methods for manufacturing dendritic cells related to our DCVax products, as well as encompassing certain methods of use and compositions that may be potential future markets for related DCVax products.
The expiration dates of the issued U.S. patents involved in our current business range from 2022 to 2036, and pending applications may involve longer time periods. The expiration dates of the issued European patents involved in our current business range from 2022 to 2024, and pending applications may involve longer time periods. For some of the earlier dates, we plan to seek extensions of the patent life, and believe we have reasonable grounds for doing so.
In addition to our patent portfolio, we have obtained Orphan Drug designation for our lead product, DCVax-L for glioma brain cancers. Such designation brings with it a variety of benefits, including potential market exclusivity for seven years in the U.S. and ten years in Europe if our product is the first of its type to reach the market.
This market exclusivity applies regardless of patents (i.e., even if the company that developed it has no patent coverage on the product). In addition, the time period for such market exclusivity does not begin to run until product sales begin. In contrast, the time period of a patent begins when the patent is filed and runs down during the years while the product is going through development and clinical trials.

Competition
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. A large and growing number of companies are actively involved in the research and development of immune therapies or cell-based therapies for cancer (including Juno, Kite, Bellicum, Agenus, Asterias, Immunicum, Sotio, AiVita and many others). In addition, many big pharma companies (including BMS, Merck, Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, Roche and others) are rapidly commercializing checkpoint inhibitor drugs to “take the brakes off” patients’ immune responses to cancer. Other novel technologies for cancer are also under development or have recently been approved, such as the Optune electro-therapy device developed by NovoCure, various biologics that Medicenna is developing, and various oncolytic virus therapies and gene therapies. Additionally, many companies are actively involved in the research and development of monoclonal antibody-based and bi-specific or tri-specific antibody-based cancer therapies. Currently, a substantial number of antibody-based drugs are approved for commercial sale for cancer therapy, and a large number of additional ones are under development. Many other third parties compete with us in developing alternative therapies to treat cancer, including: biopharmaceutical companies; biotechnology companies; pharmaceutical companies; academic institutions; and other research organizations, as well as some medical device companies.
We face extensive competition from companies developing new treatments for brain cancer. These include a variety of immune therapies, as mentioned above, as well as a variety of small molecule drugs and biologics. There are also a number of existing drugs used for the treatment of brain cancer that may compete with our product, including, Avastin® (Roche Holding AG), Gliadel® (Eisai Co. Ltd.), and Temodar® (Merck & Co., Inc.), as well as the Optune electro-therapy device (Novocure) and oncolytic viruses. Both checkpoint inhibitor drugs and T cell-based therapies are pursuing clinical trials for solid tumors, including brain cancer, as well.
Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and sales than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they enter into collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and collaborators, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs, and in obtaining sites for our clinical trials and enrolling patients.
