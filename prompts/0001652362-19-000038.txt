ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc., a Delaware corporation (‘‘IEA’’, the ‘‘Company’’, ‘‘we’’, ‘‘us’’, or ‘‘our’’) is a holding company that, through various subsidiaries, is a leading diversified infrastructure construction company with specialized energy and heavy civil expertise throughout the United States (“U.S.”). The Company specializes in providing complete engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) services throughout the U.S. for the renewable energy, traditional power and civil infrastructure industries. These services include the design, site development, construction, installation and restoration of infrastructure. Although the Company has historically focused on the wind industry, its recent acquisitions have expanded its construction capabilities and geographic footprint in the areas of environmental remediation, industrial maintenance, specialty paving, heavy civil and rail infrastructure construction, creating a diverse national platform of specialty construction capabilities. We believe we have the ability to continue to expand these services because we are well-positioned to leverage our expertise and relationships in the wind energy business to provide complete infrastructure solutions in all areas.
Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol ‘‘IEA’’. We were founded in 1947 as White Construction and we became a public company as Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc. in March 2018 when we merged with a special purpose acquisition company (a non-operating shell company).
2018 Company Highlights
Public Company - On March 26, 2018, we consummated a merger (the “Merger”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 3, 2017, by and among M III Acquisition Corporation (“M III”), IEA Energy Services, LLC (“IEA Services”), a Delaware limited liability company, Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, LLC (the “Seller”), a Delaware limited liability company and the parent of IEA Services immediately prior to such time, and the other parties thereto, which provided for, among other things, the merger of IEA Services with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of M III. See Note 2. Merger, Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information on the Merger and the continuing ownership of the Company by M III and Seller.
Acquisition of CCS, including Saiia and the ACC Companies - On September 25, 2018, we acquired Consolidated Construction Solutions I LLC (“CCS”), a leading provider of environmental and industrial engineering services. The wholly-owned subsidiaries of CCS, Saiia LLC (“Saiia”) and the American Civil Constructors LLC (the “ACC Companies”) generally enter into long-term contracts with both government and non-government customers to provide EPC services for environmental, heavy-civil and mining projects. We believe our acquisition of Saiia and the ACC Companies will provide IEA with a strong and established presence in the environmental and industrial engineering markets, enhanced civil construction capabilities and an expanded domestic footprint in less-seasonal Southeast, West and Southwest markets.
Acquisition of William Charles Construction Group, including Ragnar Benson - On November 2, 2018, we acquired William Charles Construction Group, including Ragnar Benson ("William Charles"), a leader in engineering and construction solutions for the rail infrastructure and heavy civil construction industries. We believe our acquisition of William Charles will provide IEA with a market leading position in the attractive rail infrastructure market and continue to bolster our further growth in the heavy civil and construction footprint across the Midwest and Southwest.
Industry Trends
Our industry is composed of national, regional and local companies in a range of industries, including renewable power generation, traditional power generation and the civil infrastructure industries. We believe the following industry trends will help to drive our growth and success over the coming years:
4

Renewable Power Generation
In recent years, we have maintained a tight focus on construction of renewable power production capacity as renewable energy, particularly from wind and solar, has become widely accepted within the electric utility industry and has become a cost-effective solution for the creation of new generating capacity. We believe that this shift has occurred because renewable energy power generation has reached a level of scale and maturity that permits these technologies to now be cost-effective competitors to more traditional power generation technologies, including on an unsubsidized basis. Under many circumstances, wind and solar power production offer the lowest levelized cost of energy (i.e., the all-in cost of generating power, including construction and operating costs) of any technology. As a result, wind and solar power are among the leading sources of new power generation capacity in the U.S., and wind and utility-scale solar energy generation is projected to become even more cost-effective in coming years as technological improvements make wind turbines and photovoltaic cells (and other solar generating technologies) even more efficient.
Governmental policies focused on a clean environment and the desire to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports have created incentives historically for the development of renewable energy production capacity and have created demand for more domestic, environmentally sensitive electrical power production facilities, such as wind and solar collection farms. The federal government has offered tax credits for investments in renewable energy infrastructure and production of power from renewable sources. Other tax incentives available to the renewable energy industry include accelerated tax depreciation provisions, including bonus depreciation, for certain renewable energy generation assets, such as equipment using solar or wind energy. These incentives specify a five-year depreciable life for qualifying assets rather than the longer depreciable lives of many non-renewable energy assets. In addition to shorter depreciable lives, those assets qualifying for bonus depreciation benefit from significant allowable first-year depreciation.
In addition to federal policies that historically have favored power production from renewable sources, a number of states also have supported the expansion of renewable energy generating capacity. Currently, nearly 40 states, as well as the District of Columbia and four territories, have adopted renewable portfolio standards or goals. Similarly, we believe that many corporations and retail consumers are increasingly focused on obtaining energy from renewable sources and have become a significant driver of incremental demand for wind and solar energy production capacity.
The market for the development of utility-scale wind and solar power generation is expected to remain robust. The Annual Energy Outlook 2019 published by the U.S. Department of Energy in February 2019 projected the addition of approximately 72 gigawatts of new utility-scale wind and solar capacity from 2018 to 2021, which we estimate will drive more than $17.5 billion of construction. Although this demand is driven, in part, by accelerated, incremental investment in renewable power generation sources during the phase-out period for existing tax incentives, fundamental demand for renewable power construction-and particularly for utility-scale solar farms-is projected to remain strong thereafter. See Regulation and Environmental Matters below for further discussion of phase-out period. 
Heavy Civil Construction
During 2018, heavy civil construction was only a small part of our business and accounted for less than 10% of our revenue. We believe that this will become a more significant part of our business in 2019 as a majority of the revenue of the Companies we acquired during 2018 is in this sector and we have maintained a reputation for high quality work. State and federal funding for this industry has been neglected for decades, but the near-term outlook on both state and federal levels has led us to believe that spending for infrastructure may experience significant growth over the next few years. Not only do we believe that state and federal funding is likely to increase, but alternative methods of construction, such as public and private partnerships, have gained significant traction in the United States in recent years.
We have taken steps to enhance our heavy civil construction business through acquisitions to take advantage of these growth opportunities. We believe that our business relationships with customers in this sector are excellent and our strong reputation that we have built will provide us with the foundation to grow our revenue base in this business. Additionally, there is significant overlap in labor, skills and equipment needs between our renewable energy construction business and our heavy civil infrastructure business, which we expect will provide us with operating efficiencies as we continue to expand this sector. Our renewable energy experience provides us with expertise in working in difficult conditions and environments, which we believe will provide us with a competitive advantage when bidding for more complicated and often higher margin civil and infrastructure projects.

Environmental Remediation

Coal-fired power plants have significant and recurring environmental management needs, because they consistently generate various waste byproducts throughout the power generation process. The primary type of these waste byproducts are CCRs, commonly known as coal ash. According to the American Coal Ash Association, more than 107 million tons of coal ash were generated in 2016, and according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), in 2015, coal ash was one of the largest types of waste in the U.S. Coal ash management is mission-critical to the daily operations of power plants, as they generally only have on-site storage capacity for three to four days of CCR waste accumulation. 
According to the American Coal Ash Association, as of 2016, approximately 44% of coal ash generated was disposed of. According to the EPA, approximately 80% of coal ash that was disposed of in 2012 was disposed of on-site in ash ponds or landfills. As of 2016, the American Coal Ash Association estimated that more than 1.5 billion tons of coal ash existed in ash ponds and landfills around the country. The EPA also estimates that, as of 2012, there were over 1,100 active and inactive on-site ash ponds and landfills requiring remediation or closure. These sites are typically large and will require significant capital from their owners, as well as specialized environmental expertise, to monitor on an ongoing basis, remediate, relocate the waste or completely close in an environmentally sustainable way. 
As a result of our recent acquisition of Saiia and their ability to build strong relationships in the environmental remediation business, the Company intends to continue to increase its growth of this area as a part of our business. We believe that with Saiia's reputation and our cross-selling capabilities we will be able to capture further market share and facilitate more self-performing environmental remediation opportunities in other projects that we undertake. 
Rail

For more than 150 years, the U.S. rail network has been a critical component of the U.S. transportation system and economy. Today it carries approximately one-third of U.S. exports and delivers five million tons of freight and approximately 85,000 passengers each day. According to the 2017 Infrastructure Report Card, the private freight rail industry owns the vast majority of the nation’s rail infrastructure, and continues to make significant capital investment — $27.1 billion in 2015 — to ensure the network’s good condition. Despite this investment, U.S. rail still faces clear challenges, most notably in passenger rail, which faces the dual problems of aging infrastructure and insufficient funding.

Federal forecasts predict an approximate 40% increase in U.S. freight shipments, including by rail, by 2040. To prepare for the future, the U.S. Department of Transportation has worked with the transportation industry to draft the first National Freight Strategic Plan, which addresses impediments to the efficient flow of goods in support of the nation’s economy. The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act requires the strategic plan be completed by 2017 and be updated every five years. Through the FAST Act, Congress created a new federally-funded, freight-focused competitive grant program. Fostering Advancements in Shipping And Transportation For The Long-Term Achievement of National Efficiencies (FASTLANE) grants are expected to provide $4.5 billion through 2020 to freight and highway projects of national or regional significance.
We believe that the acquisition of William Charles including Ragnar Benson, provides the Company with the ability to capitalize on the new rail infrastructure construction that will be required to support the increase in U.S. freight shipments. 
Electrical Power and High Voltage Opportunities
The U.S. electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure requires significant ongoing maintenance, upgrade and expansion to manage power line congestion and avoid delivery failures. Regional shifts in population and industry may also create pockets of demand for increased transmission and distribution construction and upgrades. According to the DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2019 published in February 2019, significant new electricity generating capacity is expected to be added through 2050, all of which must be connected to the existing electric grid. 
Renewable energy generation projects, which are typically located in remote areas, often require investment in new transmission lines to interconnect with the electrical grid. Although we have outsourced our high-voltage electrical needs historically, we implemented a program during 2018 to upgrade our in-house capacity to complete this work and continually strive to increase the portion of our high-voltage electrical work which we self-perform. We believe that this transition will 
6

afford us the opportunity to capture incremental margin on our projects and to provide enhanced service to our customers.
We believe that the same capabilities that we are building in order to self-perform high-voltage electrical work will enable us to capture incremental revenue by providing these services to others. With investment by utilities and transmission companies to modernize, secure and visually improve the existing transmission system expected to be strong over the coming years, we expect that our existing customer relationships and reputation will leave us well-positioned for growth in this sector.
Competitive Strengths
Our competitive strengths include:
Scale, Technical Expertise and Reputation in the Wind Industry. We are a national Tier 1 provider of wind energy infrastructure projects due to our established reputation for safe, high quality performance, reliable customer service and technical expertise. Because the construction and development of wind energy projects is very technically demanding, industry participants have increasingly emphasized safety, high quality performance and technical reliability. Our management estimates that construction costs represent only approximately 20% to 25% of total project cost, but construction-related risks pose the most significant threat to completion of the project. We have successfully completed over 200 wind projects over approximately the past 10 years. Our scale, experience and reputation gives us an advantage when competing for new work, both from existing and potential customers.
An Industry Leader in Safety Performance. Our industry-leading safety performance helps us enhance our reputation for high quality and reliability. Our management team strives to instill a corporate culture committed to health and safety. Our experience modification rate, a measure of our history and safety record as compared to other businesses in our industry, was 0.61 and our total recordable incident rate was 1.29 in 2018, both of which were significantly below the construction industry averages of 1.0 and 2.8, respectively, reported by the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2017. In our experience, safety records are an important factor to customers in contracting for services and we believe that our exemplary safety record is a significant differentiator for us.
Strong Relationships With Leading Industry Players. Our business model has enabled us to hold a leading position in the wind, heavy civil, rail infrastructure and environmental remediation sectors of the construction industry by successfully winning key contracts and establishing strong relationships with many established developers and operators, as well as with other market leaders. These relationships have provided us with a recurring base of blue-chip utility and other customers. We also have strong relationships with the leading original equipment manufacturers who produce the equipment for our contracts. In recent years, customers have come to emphasize reliability and excellence in execution, as well as a strong safety record, in selecting their construction partners, and our track record and reputation has made us a provider of choice to those industry participants. We have completed projects with top U.S. developers or owners, who are market leaders in their sectors. Our longstanding relationships have enabled us to develop strong alliances with many of our customers and vendors, providing us with a strong base for expansion initiatives. We continually strive to further improve these relationships and enhance our status as a preferred vendor to our customers.
Ability to Respond Quickly and Effectively. The skills required to serve each of our end-markets are similar, which allows us to utilize qualified personnel across multiple end-markets and projects. We are able to respond quickly and effectively to industry and technological changes, demand fluctuations and major weather events by allocating our employees, fleet and other assets as and where they are needed, enabling us to provide cost effective and timely services for our customers. Additionally, we have a track record of successfully recruiting and retaining skilled labor, despite industry shortages.
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team has over 175 years of combined experience and proven expertise in wind, heavy civil, rail infrastructure and environmental remediation, and a deep understanding of our customers and their requirements. Our senior management team plays a significant role in establishing and maintaining long-term relationships with our customers, supporting the growth of our business, integrating acquired businesses and managing the financial aspects of our operations.
Ability to Cross-Sell Our Product and Service Offerings. A majority of our wind customers also have other construction project requests, and a number of them are in active discussions with us for those projects. By leveraging our established relationships with our customers, we have realized additional revenues by selling products and services that our customers historically purchased from various other providers. 
7


Self-Perform Capabilities. We have made substantial investments in our self-perform capabilities and, as a result, are able to self-perform across a large portion of the services that we deliver. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our self-perform capabilities and expect to transition to self-performing a majority of our high-voltage electrical work over the course of 2019. We believe that our technical expertise, project management experience and our highly skilled and stable work force, enables us to provide our customers with a compelling package of technical reliability, consistent execution and safety. In addition, our self-perform capabilities provide us with an opportunity to retain margin while better controlling scheduling of projects, potentially leading to greater operational efficiencies for us and enhanced reliability for our customers.
Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are as follows:

Retention of strong relationships with our customers for further diversification — We believe that we have strong, long-term relationships with each of our customers and have historically worked together with them to meet their needs. By leveraging our established relationships with these customers, we intend to provide expanded products and services that will continue to diversify our revenue streams and assist our customers with their business strategies.
Ownership of Equipment — Many of our services are equipment intensive and certain key equipment used by us is specialized or customized for our businesses. The cost of construction equipment, and in some cases the availability of construction equipment, provides a significant barrier to entry into several of our businesses. We believe that our ownership and ability to lease a large and varied construction fleet at a reasonable cost, enables us to compete more effectively by ensuring availability and maximizing returns on investment of the equipment.
Maintain Operational Excellence — We have a continual focus on maintaining operational excellence, which includes the following:

• | Quality - We believe in satisfying our clients, mitigating risk, and driving improvement by performing work right the first time.


• | Technical Expertise - We have an established reputation for safe, high quality performance, reliable customer service and technical expertise in constructing technically demanding projects.


• | Safety - We believe the safety of our employees, the public and the environment is a moral obligation as well as good business. By identifying and concentrating resources to address jobsite hazards, we continually strive to reduce our incident rates and the costs associated with accidents.


• | Productivity - We strive to use our resources efficiently to deliver work on time and on budget.


• | Sustainability - Our focus on sustainability encompasses many aspects of how we conduct ourselves and is one of our Core Values. We believe sustainability is important to our clients, employees, shareholders, and communities, and is also a long-term business driver. By focusing on specific initiatives that address social, environmental and economic challenges, we believe that we are able to minimize risk and maintain a competitive advantage.


• | Code of Conduct - We believe in maintaining high ethical standards through an established code of conduct and a company-wide compliance program. Integrity is one of our core values at all times.

Acquisition Integration and Future Strategic Acquisitions and Arrangements — We expect to focus in the short-term on the business integration of our recent acquisitions, including but not limited to the back office functions and other project-related efficiencies. Consistent with our long-term strategy we will continue to pursue selected and opportunistic acquisitions, that fit our strategy of acquiring businesses with complementary cultures, niche market capabilities, excellent relationships with blue chip customers and strong, proven management teams that are retained post acquisition.

Customers
We have longstanding customer relationships with many established companies in the renewable energy, thermal power, petrochemical, environmental remediation, civil and industrial power industries, with a recurring base of blue-chip 
8

utility customers, as well as original equipment manufacturers that produce the equipment for our business. We have completed wind projects with top U.S. developers or owners, rail infrastructure projects with top railroads and heavy civil construction projects with top government agencies.
Although we are not dependent upon any one customer in any year, a relatively small number of repeat customers constitute a substantial portion of our total revenues. Accordingly, our management is responsible for developing and maintaining existing relationships with customers to secure additional projects and increase revenue from our current customer base. We believe that our strategic relationships with customers will result in future opportunities. Our management is also focused on pursuing growth opportunities with prospective new customers.

———
* Amount was not above 10% threshold.
Our work is generally performed pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require the construction or installation of an entire complex of specified units within an infrastructure system. Customers are billed monthly throughout the completion of work on a project; however, some contracts provide for additional billing upon the achievement of specific completion milestones, which may increase the billing period to more than one month. Such contracts may include retainage provisions under which, generally, from 5% to 10% of the contract price is withheld until the work has been completed and accepted by the customer. Because we may not be able to maintain our current revenue levels or our current level of capacity and resource utilization if we are not able to replace work from completed projects with new project work, we actively review our backlog of project work and take appropriate action to minimize such exposure.
We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise and reputation for customer service, as well as the relationships developed between our customers and our senior management and project management teams are important to our being retained by our customers. 
Backlog
For companies in the construction industry, backlog can be an indicator of future revenue streams. Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize beyond 2020 from the uncompleted portions of existing construction contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun and awarded contracts for which the definitive project documentation is being prepared, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. Estimated backlog for work under fixed price contracts and cost-reimbursable contracts is determined based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. These contracts are included in backlog based on the estimated total contract price upon completion. We expect to realize approximately 55.4% of our estimated backlog during 2019 and 44.6% during 2020 and beyond.
As of December 31, 2018 our total backlog was approximately $2.1 billion compared to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2017. The $1.0 billion increase is primarily related to $833.7 million of backlog related to our acquisitions coupled with a $166.3 million increase in backlog related to our legacy IEA business. Based on historical trends in the Company’s backlog, we believe awarded contracts to be firm and that the revenue for such contracts will be recognized over the life of the project. Timing of revenue for construction and installation projects included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of 
9

customer delays, regulatory factors, weather and/or other project-related factors. These changes could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. In the past, we have occasionally experienced postponements, cancellations and reductions on construction projects, due to market volatility and regulatory factors. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or the accuracy of our estimates. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings.
Backlog is not a term recognized under U.S. GAAP, although it is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a discussion of the risks associated with our backlog.
Safety and Insurance/Risk Management
We strive to instill and enforce safe work habits in our employees, and we require that our employees participate in training programs relevant to their employment, including all those required by law. We evaluate employees in part based upon their safety records and the safety records of the employees they supervise. Our business units have established robust safety programs to encourage, monitor and improve compliance with safety procedures and regulations including, behavioral based safety, jobsite safety analysis, site-specific safety orientation, subcontractor orientation, site safety audits, accident and incident safety investigations, OSHA 30-hour and 10-hour training, drug and alcohol testing and regular trainings in fall protection, confined spaces, crane rigging and flagman, first aid, CPR and AED.
Our business involves the use of heavy equipment and exposure to potentially dangerous workplace conditions. While we are committed to operating safely and prudently, we are subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries that occur in connection with our work. We maintain insurance policies for worker’s compensation, employer liability, automobile liability, general liability, inland marine property and equipment, professional and pollution liability, excess liability, and director and officers’ liability. See Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements.
Our business subjects us to the risk of adverse site conditions and unfavorable weather. While we mitigate these risks contractually to the extent possible, market conditions prevent us from fully passing these risks to our customers, and there is not a robust insurance market to cover these risks. We mitigate these risks by developing reserves we believe to be appropriate for risks that cannot be contractually mitigated, and we are evaluating the feasibility and cost-effectiviness of obtaining additional insurance to protect the Company from significant losses caused by adverse weather.
Suppliers, Materials and Working Capital
Under many of our contracts, our customers provide the necessary materials and supplies for projects and we are responsible for the installation, but not the cost or warranty, of those materials. Under certain other projects, we purchase the necessary materials and supplies on behalf of our customers from third-party providers. We are not dependent upon any one vendor and have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining project-related materials or supplies as and when required for the projects we manage.
We utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help manage our work flow. Our independent contractors typically provide their own vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, such as the impact of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work and the spending patterns of our customers, both of which influence the timing of associated spending to support related customer demand. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.’’
We bear some risk of increases in the price of materials and supplies used in the performance of our work, such as aggregate, reinforcing steel, cable, and fuel. These risks are managed contractually, by entering into contracts with suppliers that fix the price paid by the Company within the budget established for a project, or by passing the risk of commodity cost increases to the customer.
Competition
We compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate, ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms, and some of our customers employ their own personnel to perform the type of services we provide.

10

The primary factors influencing competition in our industry are price, reputation, quality and delivery, relevant expertise, adequate financial resources, geographic presence, high safety ratings and a proven track record of operational success. We believe that our national platform, track record of completion, relationships with vendors, strong safety record and access to skilled labor enables us to compete favorably in all of these factors. We also believe that our ability to provide unionized and non-unionized workforces across a national footprint allows us to compete for a broad range of projects. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they award most of their work through a bid process. We believe our safety record, experience and price are often principal factors in determining which service provider is selected.
Seasonality
Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, receipt of required regulatory approvals, permits and rights of way, project timing and schedules and holidays. See ‘‘IEA Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of Business.’’
Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally, including laws and regulations related to labor relations, wages, worker safety and environmental protection.
We are also subject to numerous environmental laws, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.
We believe we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. However, we could incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. See ‘‘Risk Factors-We could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations and to address violations of liabilities under these requirements.’’
The potential impact of climate change on our operations is highly uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensity and temperature levels. Our operating results are significantly influenced by weather and major changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in significantly more adverse weather conditions in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity and increases in certain other costs, which could negatively impact revenues and gross margins.
In light of changes in federal government priorities and the cost-competitiveness of wind and solar power production, certain of the tax credits for production of renewable energy are phasing out. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (‘‘CAA’’), which contains certain federal tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry, provided for the gradual elimination of certain of these incentives. Currently, the tax code provides that the production tax credit for wind projects (the ‘‘PTC’’) applies to qualifying projects for which the construction commencement date was prior to January 1, 2020. The PTC was reduced by 20% for 2017, has been reduced by 40% for 2018, and finally will be reduced by 60% for 2019. Similarly, a phase down rate of the investment tax credit (the ‘‘ITC’’), which is available in lieu of PTC, is available for wind projects: 30% ITC for projects commencing before 2017, 24% for projects commencing in 2017, 18% for projects commencing in 2018 and 12% for projects commencing in 2019. Solar projects, however, will be eligible for an investment tax credit (the ‘‘Solar ITC’’) only. The Solar ITC is 30% for projects commencing prior to 2020 and will be reduced to 26% for projects commencing in 2020 and to 22% for projects commencing in 2021. After 2021, the Solar ITC will remain at 10% for projects that commence prior to 2022, but are placed in service after 2023.
Additionally, although the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act in December 2017 did not modify the existing production tax credit and investment tax credit incentive structures, a base erosion and anti-abuse tax, or ‘‘BEAT’’ provision, contained in the 2017 Tax Act imposes a minimum tax on certain corporations, and only 80% of the value of any such corporation’s production or investment tax credits can be applied as a reduction to such corporation’s BEAT liability. Accordingly, this BEAT provision could reduce the incentive for certain taxable investors to invest in tax equity financing arrangements and could materially reduce the value and availability such tax credits, grants and incentives for certain participants and financing sources in the wind and solar industry. The 2017 Tax Act permits the immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures between 
11

September 27, 2017 and January 1, 2023, but this new rule could be less valuable than a dollar-for-dollar investment tax credit or production tax credit, given the reduced corporate income tax rate of 21%. Any of the foregoing changes arising from the 2017 Tax Act, as well as other changes in law not mentioned herein, could adversely impact the demand for development of wind and solar energy generation facilities. See ‘‘Risk Factors-The U.S. wind and solar industries benefit from tax and other economic incentives and political and governmental policies.’’ for a discussion of the risks associated with these federal and state tax incentives. 
Employees
The Company has a workforce of both union and non-union employees that allows us to work anywhere in the U.S. We have a scalable workforce, with approximately 2,600 peak employees. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,250 employees, approximately 595 of whom were represented by unions or were subject to collective bargaining agreements. See Note 14. Employee Benefit Plans in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.
We hire employees from a number of sources, including our industry, trade schools, colleges and universities. We attract and retain employees by offering a competitive salary, benefits package, opportunities for advancement and an exemplary safety record. We strive to offer a caring and stable work environment that enables our employees to improve their performance, and enhance their skills and knowledge. We believe that our corporate culture and core value system helps us to attract and retain employees. We provide opportunities for promotion and mobility within our organization, which we also believe helps us to retain our employees. Our employees participate in ongoing educational programs, some of which are internally developed, to enhance their technical and management skills through classroom and field training.
