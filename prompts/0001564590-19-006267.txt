Item 1. Business.
BUSINESS
 Overview
 We were incorporated as Vivint Solar, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in 2011. We offer distributed solar energy — electricity generated by a solar energy system installed at or near customers’ locations — to residential customers primarily through a customer-focused and neighborhood-driven direct-to-home sales model. Through investment funds, we own a substantial majority of the solar energy systems we install and provide solar electricity pursuant to long-term contracts with our customers. Additionally, we wholly own a smaller number of solar energy systems outside of investment funds. We also sell solar energy systems outright to customers. 

1

Customers that enter long-term contracts pay little to no money upfront, typically receive savings on solar-generated electricity rates relative to utility-generated electricity rates following system interconnection to the power grid and continue to benefit from locked-in energy prices over the term of their contracts, insulating them against unpredictable increases in utility rates. The majority of these customers sign 20-year contracts for solar electricity generated by our systems and pay us directly over the term of their contracts.
 Our 20-year customer contracts generate predictable, recurring cash flows and establish a long-term relationship with homeowners. As of December 31, 2018 the average estimated nominal contracted payment for our long-term customer contracts was approximately $28,600, and there is the potential for additional payments if customers choose to renew their contracts at the end of the term. The ownership of the solar energy systems we install under long-term customer contracts allows us and the other fund investors to benefit from various local, state and federal incentives. We obtain financing based on cash flows from customers and these incentives. When customers decide to move or sell the home prior to the end of their contract term, the customer contracts allow our customers to transfer their obligations to the new home buyer. If the home buyer does not wish to assume the customer’s obligations, the contract allows us to require the customer to purchase the system. Our sources of financing are used to offset our direct installation costs and our allocated overhead expenses. As of February 28, 2019, we had raised 25 investment funds to which investors such as banks and other large financial investors have committed to invest approximately $1.9 billion. The undrawn committed capital for these funds as of February 28, 2019 was approximately $176 million, which we estimate will fund approximately 86 megawatts of future deployments.
 We also offer our customers the option to purchase solar energy systems for cash or through third-party loan financing. Selling solar energy systems allows us to address customers who prefer to own the solar energy system and assume the long-term benefits and risks of system ownership. Customers who choose this option are generally eligible for various local, state and federal incentives, which may help to offset the cost of their solar energy system.
 We have developed an integrated approach to providing residential distributed solar energy where we fully control the lifecycle of our customers’ experience including the initial professional consultation, design and engineering process, installation, and ongoing monitoring and service. We deploy our sales force on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis, which allows us to cultivate a geographically concentrated customer base that reduces our costs and increases our operating efficiency. We couple this model with repeatable and scalable processes to establish warehouse facilities, assemble and train sales and installation teams and open new offices. We believe that our processes enable us to expand within existing markets and into new markets. We also believe that our direct sales model and integrated approach represent a differentiated platform, unique in the industry, that maximizes sales effectiveness, delivering high levels of customer satisfaction and driving cost efficiency. 
 From our inception in May 2011 through December 31, 2018, we have installed solar energy systems with an aggregate of 1,060.9 meg
awatts of capacity at approximately 154,600 homes for an average solar energy system capacity of approximately 6.9 kilowatts. 
 Our Approach
 The key elements of our integrated approach to providing distributed solar energy include:
  
• | Professional consultation. We deploy our direct-to-home sales force to provide in-person professional consultations to prospective customers to evaluate the feasibility of installing a solar energy system at their residence. Our sales closing and referral rates are enhanced by homeowners’ responsiveness to our direct-to-home, neighborhood-by-neighborhood outreach strategy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Design and engineering. We have developed a process that enables us to design and install a custom solar energy system that delivers customer savings. This process, which incorporates proprietary software, standardized templates and data derived from on-site surveys, allows us to design each system to comply with complex and varied state and local regulations and optimize system performance on a per panel basis. We continue to pursue technology innovation to integrate accurate system design into the initial sales consultation process as a competitive tool to enhance the customer experience and increase sales close rates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Installation. We are a licensed contractor in the markets we serve and are responsible for each customer installation. Once we complete the system design, we obtain the necessary building permits and begin installation. Upon completion, we schedule the required inspections and arrange for interconnection to the power grid. By directly handling these logistics, we control quality and streamline the system installation process for our customers. Throughout this process, we apprise our customers of the project status with regular updates from our account representatives.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Monitoring and service. We monitor the performance of our solar energy systems, leveraging a combination of internally developed solutions as well as capabilities provided by our suppliers. Our systems use communication gateways and monitoring services to collect performance data, and we use this data to ensure that we deliver quality operations and maintenance services for our solar energy systems. If services are required, our strong local presence enables rapid response times.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Referrals. We believe our commitment to delivering customer satisfaction and our concentrated geographic deployment strategy have generated sales through customer referrals, which increase our neighborhood penetration rates and drive our growth. Our financial returns also benefit from the cost savings derived from increasing the density of installations in a neighborhood.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become the premier provider of distributed solar energy. Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Building the most sustainable business in the residential solar industry. We are working to enhance the sustainability of our business by striving to improve the margins we generate on every system we install. We improve our margins by reducing our cost per watt over time, by pricing appropriately in each market and by growing in the right markets. We seek to balance our growth against the operating cash flows and project funding required to offset our operating expenses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Delighting our customers. We strive to provide a best-in-class customer experience. We offer customized solar energy solutions to each of our customers based on their individual situation and needs, and we are streamlining the time from when a customer signs a contract to when their system is operational. We are also continually working to improve our processes and customer communication in an effort to provide superior customer service. Additionally, we employ a detailed quality assessment process to our installations to validate that we maintain a high installation standard.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing a differentiated solution. We aim to provide unique products in an increasingly commoditized industry, and we believe the market needs smart energy solutions that combine how energy is produced, made available and intelligently consumed. We have formed strategic relationships to develop and provide distinctive solutions to our customers, such as battery storage and electric vehicle charging products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accessing capital on favorable terms. We partner with various investors to form investment funds that monetize the recurring customer payments under our long-term customer contracts, as well as the ITCs, accelerated tax depreciation and other incentives associated with residential solar energy systems. We have also entered into financing facilities to further monetize recurring cash flows and to fund solar energy system development. We plan to pursue additional debt, equity and other financing strategies in order to access capital on favorable terms to enable our continued growth.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growing strategically. We operate in states whose utility prices, sun exposure, climate conditions and regulatory policies provide the most compelling markets for distributed solar energy. We plan to enlarge our addressable market by expanding our presence to new states on a measured basis. For example, we complement our traditional long-term customer contracts by providing customers the option to purchase solar energy systems outright, which allows us to enter markets where customers prefer to own their solar energy systems or where our traditional, long-term customer contracts are not permitted by local regulations or are not economically feasible. Additionally, we have become more selective in our policies to increase the incremental value of each installation by limiting the installation of smaller system sizes, limiting installations on certain roof types and raising prices in certain markets. We are also expanding into new customer acquisition channels such as homebuilders and retailers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customer Contracts 
 Our primary product offerings include the following: 
  
• | Power Purchase Agreements. Under power purchase agreements, or PPAs, we charge customers a fee per kilowatt hour based on the electricity production of the solar energy system, which is billed monthly. PPAs typically have a term of 20 years and are subject to an annual price escalator of 2.9%. Over the term of the PPA, we operate the system and agree to maintain it in good condition. Customers who buy energy from us under PPAs are covered by our workmanship warranty equal to the length of the term of these agreements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Legal-form Leases. Under legal-form leases, or Solar Leases, we charge customers a fixed monthly payment to lease the solar energy system, which is based on a calculation that accounts for expected solar energy generation. Solar Leases typically have a term of 20 years and are typically subject to an annual price escalator of 2.9%, though some markets offer Solar Leases with no annual price escalator. We provide our Solar Lease customers a performance guarantee, under which we agree to refund certain payments to the customer if the solar energy system does not meet the guaranteed production level in the prior 12-month period. Over the term of the Solar Lease, we operate the system and agree to maintain it in good condition, and in some markets we offer to install a battery storage system along with the solar energy system. Customers who lease equipment from us under Solar Leases are covered by our workmanship warranty equal to the length of the term of these agreements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Solar Energy System Sales. Under solar energy system sales, or System Sales, we offer our customers the option to purchase solar energy systems for cash or through third-party financing. The price for these contracts is determined as a function of the respective market rate and the size of the solar energy system to be installed. Customers can additionally contract with us for certain structural upgrades, smart home products, battery storage systems, electric vehicle charging stations and other accessories in connection with the installation of a solar energy system based on the market where they are located. We believe System Sales are advantageous to us as they provide immediate access to cash.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Of our 196.0 megawatts installed in 2018, approximately 79% were installed under PPAs, 6% were installed under Solar Leases and 15% were installed under System Sales. As of December 31, 2018, the average FICO score of our customers was approximately 760.
 Sales and Marketing
 We place our integrated solar energy systems through a scalable sales organization that relies primarily on a direct-to-home sales model. We believe that a direct, customer-facing sales model is important throughout our sales process to maximize our sales success and customer experience. The members of our sales force typically reside and work within the markets they support. We also generate sales volume through customer referrals. Customer referrals increase in relation to our penetration in a market and shortly after market entry become an increasingly effective way to market our solar energy systems. 
 In addition to direct sales, we sell to customers through our inside sales team and through sales dealer agreements that we have entered into with Vivint and others. We also continue to explore opportunities to sell solar energy systems to customers through a number of other distribution channels, including relationships with real estate management companies, home builders, retailers, large construction, electrical and roofing companies and other third parties that have access to large numbers of potential solar customers. 
 Operations
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Utah. We manage inventory through our local warehouses and maintain a fleet of over 700 trucks and other vehicles to support our installers and operations. In 2018, our field teams completed on average approximately 2,300 residential installations per month. We manage thousands of projects as they move through the stages of engineering, permitting, installation, maintenance and monitoring.
 We offer a range of warranties to our investment funds on our solar energy systems under long-term customer contracts to ensure the solar energy systems remain productive. Under our workmanship warranty, we are obligated, at our cost and expense, to correct defects in our installation work, which depending on the particular investment fund, is for periods of five to 20 years. Generally, our maintenance obligations to our investment funds do not include the cost of panels, inverters or racking, should such major components require replacement. The cost of such components is borne instead by the applicable investment fund, although we are obligated to install such equipment as part of our services covered by the agreed maintenance services fee. We provide ongoing service and repairs to solar energy systems under PPAs and Solar Leases during the entire term of the customer relationship. We also agree to provide a workmanship warranty and maintain the solar energy systems we sell to customers through System Sales for a period of one to ten years. We expect the costs we incur in providing these services will continue to grow as the number of systems in our portfolio increases and as installed solar energy systems age.
 Suppliers
 We purchase solar panels, inverters and other system components from a limited number of suppliers. Substantially all of our solar panels and inverters are produced outside the United States. We generally source the other products related to our solar energy systems through a variety of suppliers and distributors.

4

If we fail to develop, maintain and expand our relationships with these or other suppliers, our ability to meet anticipated demand for our solar energy systems may be adversely affected, or we may only be able to offer our systems at higher costs or after delays. To reduce risk, we have added suppliers in the module, inverter and racking product groups. If one or more of the suppliers that we rely upon to meet anticipated demand ceases or reduces production due to its financial condition, acquisition by a competitor or otherwise, it may be difficult to quickly identify alternative suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms, and our ability to satisfy this demand may be adversely affected.
 We screen all suppliers and components based on expected cost, reliability, warranty coverage, ease of installation and other ancillary costs. We typically enter into master contract arrangements with our major suppliers that define the general terms and conditions of our purchases, including warranties, product specifications, indemnities, licenses, delivery and other customary terms. We typically purchase solar panels, inverters and racking from our suppliers at then prevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders issued under our master contract arrangements. From time to time we find it advantageous to enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers. 
 Although the solar panel market has seen an increase in supply, upward pressure on prices may occur due to growth in the solar industry, regulatory policy changes and the resulting increase in demand for solar panels and the raw materials necessary to manufacture them. 
 On January 22, 2018, the President of the United States announced the imposition of safeguard measures for a period of four years that include (1) a 30% tariff on imports of solar cells not partially or fully assembled into other products and (2) a 30% tariff on imported solar panels. The tariff on imported solar panels will decline 5% each year in the second, third and fourth years. The safeguard measures went into effect on February 7, 2018 and apply to imports from all foreign countries, including Mexico and Canada, except certain developing countries that are members of the World Trade Organization.
 On September 17, 2018, the President of the United States announced the imposition of tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. Inverters imported from China are listed as subject to the new duties. Tariffs of 10% on inverters went into effect on September 24, 2018, and the tariffs were scheduled to rise to 25% on January 1, 2019. In December 2018, the President agreed to suspend further trade action for 90 days, and in February 2019 to further suspended trade action, to continue negotiations and to leave the tariff at the 10% rate for the time being. Our various inverter suppliers are still determining how they will manage these tariffs. We are currently seeing various responses from inverter suppliers to the 10% tariff, ranging from no price increases to passing on the majority of the tariff to the purchaser through price increases. We are unsure how supplier pricing will be affected by the potential implementation of the 25% tariff. Additionally, it remains unclear whether the tariff applies to all components that accompany an inverter, or just to the inverter itself. 
 Competition
 We believe that our primary competitors are the traditional utilities that supply electricity to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utilities primarily based on price (cents per kilowatt hour), predictability of future prices (by providing pre-determined annual price escalations) and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We believe that we compete favorably with traditional utilities based on these factors in the states where we operate.
 We also compete with companies that are not regulated like traditional utilities but that have access to the traditional utility electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure pursuant to state and local pro-competitive and consumer choice policies, as well as with national and local solar companies such as Tesla’s SolarCity subsidiary and Sunrun Inc. These companies may offer products that are similar to our PPAs, Solar Leases and System Sales. We believe that we compete favorably with these companies.
 In addition, we compete with solar companies in the downstream value chain of solar energy. For example, we face competition from purely finance driven organizations that acquire customers and then subcontract out the installation of solar energy systems, from installation businesses that seek financing from external parties, from large construction companies and utilities and increasingly from sophisticated electrical and roofing companies. These distributed energy competitors typically employ contractual arrangements with third parties, leaving the customer in the position of having to deal with different companies for different aspects of their solar energy systems. We believe that we compete favorably with these companies because we offer an integrated approach to residential solar energy systems, which includes in-house sales, financing, engineering, installation, maintenance and monitoring. Many of our competitors offer only a subset of the services we provide. Aside from simple cost efficiency, we offer distinct practical benefits as an all-in-one provider such as providing a single point of contact and accountability for our offerings during the relationship with our customers. We primarily use our own installation teams, enabling us to better scale our business while maintaining quality control.

5

We also compete with solar companies that offer community solar products and utility companies that provide renewable power purchase programs. Some customers may choose to subscribe to a community solar project or renewable subscriber programs instead of installing a solar energy system on their home, which could affect our sales. Additionally, some utility companies (and some utility-like entities, such as community choice aggregators in California) have generation portfolios that are increasingly renewable in nature. We believe we compete favorably with these options. 
 Technology and Intellectual Property
 We, directly or through our wholly owned subsidiary Solmetric Corporation, also known as Vivint Solar Labs, have a number of patents and pending applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These patents and applications relate to shade and site analysis, installation and monitoring technologies. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to file additional patent applications as we innovate through our research and development efforts. Vivint Solar Labs is our research and development team focused on technologies that we believe will benefit our business, as they have significant experience with photovoltaic hardware and installation instruments.
 As part of our strategy, we may expand our technological capabilities through targeted acquisitions, licensing technology and intellectual property from third parties, joint development relationships with partners and suppliers and other strategic initiatives as we strive to offer the industry’s best operational efficiency, performance prediction, operations and management.
 Government Regulation, Policies and Incentives
 Government Regulation
 Except as described below with respect to New York, we are not regulated as a public utility in any of the markets in which we currently operate. As a result, we are not subject to the various federal, state and local standards, restrictions and regulatory requirements applicable to traditional utilities that operate transmission and distribution systems and that have an obligation to serve electric customers within a specified jurisdiction. 
 In October 2017, the Public Service Commission of the State of New York, or the NYPSC, entered an order determining that residential rooftop solar energy providers are “electric corporations” (the term for electric utilities under New York state law) and requiring changes that will affect certain aspects of our business. The order, which is part of a broader proceeding before the NYPSC associated with regulating and overseeing distributed energy resource suppliers, is premised on the NYPSC’s determination that it has the jurisdiction to oversee our business, and businesses like ours, in the same way that it oversees public utilities. Though NYPSC is, to our knowledge, the first state public commission to take the position that residential rooftop solar energy providers are subject to the same regulatory oversight as electric utilities, we understand from the Solar Energy Industries Association, or SEIA, that other public service commissions are following what is happening in New York and may take similar action depending on the outcome.
 Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We strive to maintain compliance with applicable OSHA, DOT and similar government regulations; however, as discussed in the section captioned “Risk Factors—Compliance with occupational safety and health requirements and best practices can be costly, and noncompliance with such requirements may result in potentially significant monetary penalties, operational delays and adverse publicity,” there have been instances in which we have experienced workplace accidents and received citations from regulators, resulting in fines. Such instances have not materially impacted our business or relations with our employees.
 Government Policies
 Net metering is one of several key policies that have enabled the growth of distributed solar in the United States. Net metering allows homeowners to receive credit for the energy that their solar energy system generates in excess of that consumed onsite to offset energy usage at times when the solar installation is not generating energy. In states that provide for net metering, the customer typically pays for the net energy used or receives a credit against future bills at the retail rate if more energy is produced by the solar energy system than consumed onsite. In some states and utility territories, customers are also reimbursed by the electric utility for net excess generation on a periodic basis. Each of the states where we currently serve customers has adopted some form of a net metering policy. 

6

In recent years, net metering programs have been subject to regulatory scrutiny and legislative proposals in some states, such as Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Texas and Utah. Utilities are proposing new and varied revisions to their net metering programs, with such proposals decided by the state public utilities commissions. These revisions include capping the numbers of customers that can elect net metering within a utility service territory, imposing new fixed charges for grid service or interconnection, and reducing the retail rate value of the net metered generation. In California, for example, customers within the service territory of San Diego Gas and Electric, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and Southern California Edison Company, must take service on a new net metering successor tariff. For this new tariff, the California Public Utilities Commission largely uses the current net metering form with full retail compensation for exports but allows the utilities to impose reasonable interconnection fees and some additional charges on customers and will require such customers to take service on time-of-use rates. There are no caps under the new Net Energy Metering, or NEM, successor tariff. Further, municipal utilities are generally not subject to the same state laws and public commission oversight as compared to investor owned utilities and may make drastic and abrupt changes. As we continue to expand into areas with municipal utilities, we may be subject to greater risk of regulatory uncertainty.
Government Incentives
 Federal, state and local government and regulatory bodies provide for tariff structures and incentives to various parties including owners, end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy. These incentives come in various forms, including rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, renewable energy certificates associated with renewable energy generation, exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments and net metering. We rely on these governmental and regulatory programs to finance solar energy system installations, which enables us to lower the price we charge customers for energy from our solar energy systems, and to lease or purchase these systems, helping to achieve customer acceptance of solar energy with those customers as an alternative to utility-provided power.
 The Federal government currently offers a 30% ITC under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for the installation of certain solar power facilities; legislation was passed in December 2015 which extended this 30% rate through December 31, 2019. By statute, the ITC percentage is scheduled to decrease to 26% of the basis of a solar energy system that began construction during 2020, 22% for 2021 and 10% if construction begins after 2021 or the solar energy system is placed into service after 2023. 
 The economics of purchasing a solar energy system are also improved by eligibility for accelerated tax depreciation, also known as the modified accelerated cost recovery system, or MACRS, which allows for the depreciation of equipment according to an accelerated schedule. The acceleration of depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that reduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and increases the return on investment.
 Some of the states in which we operate offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for solar energy that is additive to the ITC. Further, many of the states and local jurisdictions have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits.
 Some state governments, traditional utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy efficiency measures. Capital costs or “up-front” rebates provide funds to solar customers or developers or system owners based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer’s solar energy system. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to solar customers or a system owner based on the energy generated by the solar energy system during a pre-determined period.
 Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production. Twenty-nine states, the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories have adopted a renewable portfolio standard that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems, by a specified date. To prove compliance with such mandates, utilities usually must surrender solar renewable energy certificates, or SRECs, to the applicable authority. Solar energy system owners such as our investment funds often are able to sell SRECs to utilities directly or in SREC markets.
 Workforce
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a total workforce of 2,542, which does not include direct sellers. None of our service providers are represented by a labor union, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
