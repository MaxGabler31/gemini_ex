BUSINESS
 
(1) Principal products or services and their markets;
 
The Companys technology comprises two product lines called BizjetMobile and fflya. The products deliver inflight connectivity for business aviation and commercial airlines respectively.
 
BizjetMobile provides corporate jets with an alternative global inflight connectivity solution and is marketed under the brand names CHiiMP and KONNG. They are mobile Apps that deliver highly optimized inflight text and email for passengers and crew. The on-board network comprises an integrated satellite transceiver incorporating a Bluetooth hotspot that uses a set of algorithms and file management protocols that are custom built for aviation satellite networks. All communications are managed by a cloud-based gateway and report by user, flight, aircraft, file, and message type. As a result, passengers and crew receive unlimited inflight connectivity for a flat low monthly rate.
 
fflya provides airlines with a customized global inflight connectivity approach based on the latest mobile App technology, narrowband satellite links and Bluetooth technology. The fflya platform reduces the installation, certification and equipment costs by up to 90% compared to inflight broadband. In addition, it uses a cloud-based messaging platform capable of delivering real-time demographic and profiling data. By incorporating embedded advertising and destination sponsors, fflya can deliver free messaging to airline passengers.

BizjetMobile and fflya leverage off the existing Inmarsat & Iridium satellites, but will be further enhanced by Next Generation Iridium satellites that commenced commercial operation in Q1 2019, and Iridium Certus for aviation, which will commence operation in Q1 2020.
 
The Company has completed 80 BizjetMobile installations to date, operating across Asia Pacific, the Americas, Europe and the Middle East.
 
Markets
 
BizjetMobiles target market is the business aviation industry, specifically international corporate jets searching for an alternative low-cost global inflight connectivity solution or an-add on service to reduce their operational costs.
 
fflyas target market is primarily low cost airlines operating single aisle aircraft, for example, Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, that struggle to justify equipping their fleets with expensive Wi-Fi platforms as their business model targets passengers who are unwilling to pay. Of the 18,000 commercial airliners currently in operation, the B737/A320 series account for 13,000 of which approximately 75% are operated by Low Cost Airlines. Single aisle aircraft represent 75% of the 35,000 new aircraft forecast to be delivered over the next 20 years.
 
An inflight Bluetooth network dramatically reduces system and data costs on and off the aircraft. It can also self-facilitate the funding of a controlled pathway to high speed connectivity via multiple new revenue opportunities. The fflya software App framework can be easily integrated into an existing airline booking App to create further cost savings and benefits for passengers. The program creates immediate revenue by enabling passengers to book tours and attractions inflight, while including free messaging to allow them to keep in touch with family and friends. fflya also delivers a virtual private network controlled by the airline for operations and crew to communicate inflight and on-the-ground. This allows airlines to overlay new applications on the platform to improve crew efficiencies and enhance the inflight experience for passengers.
 
(2) Distribution methods of the products or services;
 
The Company has appointed BizjetMobile agents for the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific who will represent the Company on a commission basis.
 
(3) Status of any publicly announced new product or service;
 
Following the initial soft launch of the fflya airline program at APEX (Airline Passenger Experience Association) Expo on October 23, 2016, the Company has completed ground and flight testing of the Bluetooth network with a major European Airline on an A380 and B777. Further internal testing was also conducted on B787 and A340.
 
As a result, the Companys airline program has been refined into two airline products:
 
1. CrewX (Crew Exchange) - is the simplest way to keep cabin crew connected. CrewX is a Bluetooth communications framework that can be easily embedded into any existing crew App or operate as a stand-alone App. CrewX provides a virtual private secure network for crew to enhance efficiency of crew communications on-board the aircraft, without needing to install certified aircraft servers, Wi-Fi networks or perform modifications to the aircraft systems.
 
2. fflya - provides 45,000 tours and attractions via a partnership with Viator (a Trip Advisor company) programmed to the passenger destination by flight. The program facilitates free passenger messaging profiled and embedded with sponsors and links. It can be embedded into an airlines existing booking App which can create an instant database of millions of potential users when the airline App is updated, in addition to the capability to brand each service or icon. Every SMS text message can include an embedded sponsor i.e. Delivered by XXXX or branded by Telco or airline, and every free email can incorporate sponsored promotions i.e. Logos or Links promoting the airline, service or sponsors. The complete portable fflya hardware platform is lightweight and low-cost (US$15,000 per aircraft) and doesnt require expensive broadband satellite connections. Due to the low cost of the hardware, it can be easily funded by prepaid sponsorship.
 
(4) Competitive business conditions and the small business issuer's competitive position in the industry and methods of competition;

Competition
 
In the United States, the market is dominated GOGO Inc. (formally Aircell). GOGOs system connects passenger devices via Wi-Fi, having implemented an exclusive terrestrial wireless network across the United States for transmission off the aircraft. As of June 30, 2019, GOGO had 3,091 airliners, the majority of equipped aircraft being United, American and Delta Airlines. GOGO also has 5,462 domestic business jets connected to its system.
 
A further 5,099 aircraft are equipped with the Aircell (division of GOGO) Iridium satellite telephone systems. These are legacy satellite systems and GOGO Biz Services cannot be delivered by Iridium. Several BizjetMobile customers are connected via the Aircell Iridium systems.
 
Internationally, four major Wi-Fi industry players dominate the inflight Wi-Fi airlines business. They are Panasonic, GOGO Inc., VIASAT and INMARSAT.
 
Panasonic and GOGO Inc. are resellers of satellite services, whereas VIASAT and INMARSAT are satellite owner-operators. The primary market for all four vendors is predominantly Tier 1 airlines and national flag carriers. These airlines provide business travellers with an adequate level of Internet connectivity at a cost per flight similar to the daily rate of many 5-star hotels. In the many cases, first and business class passengers receive this service free of charge.
 
Equipment, installation and certification costs on Wi-Fi platforms are substantial and where possible, most airlines will exercise the option to have it factory installed on new aircraft. Approximately 25% of the worlds airlines are currently equipped with inflight Wi-Fi, the majority of which are either in the U.S.A or are long haul wide body Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Recent forecasts suggest that half of the worlds airlines will be fully equipped by 2022.
 
The challenge for the Company to compete, is to target the remaining market and create a platform and business model that eliminates the financial risk, generates new revenue, enhances the passenger experience, and removes the high operational/user costs associated with heavy and expensive Wi-Fi platforms.
 
The Company meets these challenges with a platform that is 95% lighter and cheaper and controlled by a proprietary gateway protocol that is up to 90% more efficient in delivering todays mobile App-based communications.
 
The Company believes it will be able to compete with other companies in both the business aircraft and commercial airline fields because of our very low equipment costs, unique business model and little or no certification issues unlike Wi-Fi. Bluetooth has been tested and documented as safe for use in aircraft.
 
(5) Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers;
 
Not applicable.
 
(6) Dependence on one or a few major customers;
 
The Company will be dependent on its agents to market the product to generate income from hardware sales and service fees. The timing and extent of that marketing will be dependent on the resources and efforts of its agents.
 
(7) Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts, including duration;
 
The Company originally acquired the application for an Australian patent and received notification that the International Preliminary Report on Patentability had been established. The Company filed national phase patent applications in Australia, the United States, China and European Union. In January 2010, the Company received the Australian patent. In January 2012, the Company received the Chinese patent. With the advent of Bluetooth Smart, the technology and the Company's IP has advanced to a point where the patent is no longer relevant. The Company subsequently decided to proceed no further with the patents as the technology is predominately software based and protected by copyright.
 
(8) Need for any government approval of principal products or services. If government approval is necessary and the small business issuer has not yet received that approval, discuss the status of the approval within the government approval process;

Installation and use of aircraft avionics in aircraft requires prior certification and approval by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and equivalent regulatory authorities of foreign governments on each aircraft type and for each airline, although FAA approval is generally globally acceptable.
 
The certification process begins with the installation of the system on an aircraft after which it is certified by an FAA accredited engineer. The certification is then applicable to similar aircraft types and modified for other aircraft type. In countries other than the United States, the equivalent aviation authority procedures will apply to the certification of the system, but the United States FAA is generally accepted by local certifying authorities throughout the world. Prior to certification and approval, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the system has been designed and manufactured and complies with the appropriate aviation standards, namely DO160 for hardware and DO178 for software. Following this step, the system must be installed on an aircraft and tested, including a ground and flight test.
 
As the App is installed on a mobile phone or tablet, which are regarded as carry on devices, and operated in flight or offline mode, no aircraft certification is required however, in the majority of cases the final approval for use in flight will be at the discretion of the aircraft operator.
 
The business aircraft system has been designed to be is installed as a Portable Electronic Device and as such little or no certification is required. The Company has a similar launch plan for airlines which will ultimately lead to a lower cost certifiable platform.
 
Finally, the Company's Android and IOS Apps are based on a Bluetooth network and Bluetooth has been tested and documented as safe for use in aircraft, which simplifies the operator acceptance process.
 
(9) Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business;
 
The company must maintain good standing, comply with applicable local business licensing requirements, prepare and file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and comply with other applicable securities laws, rules and regulations.
 
Existing or probable governmental regulations have not impacted our operations except for the increased costs of compliance with reporting obligations. These additional costs remain consistent as long as the company continues as a reporting corporation.
 
(10) Estimate of the amount spent during each of the last two fiscal years on research and development activities, and if applicable the extent to which the cost of such activities is borne directly by customers;
 
The Company estimates over the last 2 years it has expended $300,000 on research and development, none of which has been borne by the customers.
 
(11) Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws (federal, state and local); and
 
Not applicable
 
(12) Number of total employees and number of full time employees.
 
The company does not have any employees, instead contracts the Chief Financial Officer, as well as contracting marketing and technical services as required.
