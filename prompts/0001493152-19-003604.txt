ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Until July 31, 2018, we operated a real estate segment which generated revenue from service fees (for video creation and production and website hosting (ReachFactor)) and product sales (Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 and Microvideo app). The real estate segment was formed through the merging of three divisions: (i) our fully licensed real estate division (formerly known as Webdigs); (ii) our television media contracts division (Home Preview Channel /Extraordinary Vacation Homes); and (iii) our Real Estate Virtual Tour and Media group division (RealBiz 360). The assets of these divisions were used to create a new suite of real estate products and services that created stickiness through the utilization of video, social media and loyalty programs. At the core of our programs was our proprietary video creation technology which allowed for an automated conversion of data (text and pictures of home listings) to a video with voice and music. We provided video search, storage and marketing capabilities on multiple platform dynamics for web, mobile and television. Once a home, personal or community video was created using our proprietary technology, it could be published to social media, emailed or distributed to multiple real estate websites, broadband or television for consumer viewing.
 
We entered into a Contribution and Spin-off Agreement with NestBuilder.com Corp., a Nevada corporation (“NestBuilder”), on October 27, 2017, as amended on January 28, 2018, whereby, effective as of August 1, 2018, we spun off our real estate division into NestBuilder. Since August 1, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Verus Foods, Inc. (“Verus Foods”), an international supplier of consumer food products, are focused on international consumer packaged goods, foodstuff distribution and wholesale trade. Our fine food products are sourced in the United States and exported internationally. We market consumer food products under our own brand primarily to supermarkets, hotels and other members of the wholesale trade. Initially, in 2017, we focused on frozen foods, particularly meat, poultry, seafood, vegetables, and french fries with beverages as a second vertical. During 2018, we added cold-storage facilities, and began seeking international sources for fresh fruit, produce and similar perishables, as well as other consumer packaged foodstuff with the goal to create vertical farm-to-market operations. Verus has also begun to explore new consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) non-food categories, such as cosmetic and fragrances, for future product offerings.
 
We currently have a significant regional presence in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) and sub-Saharan Africa (excluding The Office of Foreign Assets Control restricted nations), with deep roots in the Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) countries, which includes the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The Company’s long-term goal is to source goods and generate international wholesale and retail CPG sales in North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia.
 
In December 2016, Verus Foods entered into a sales contract pursuant to which Verus Foods may sell certain meat products for an aggregate sale price of up to approximately $79 million. As of October 31, 2018, the Company has sold approximately $8,200,000 in products pursuant to the sales contract. In addition, in August 2017, Verus Foods entered into a two-year exclusive distribution agreement whereby Verus Foods will purchase certain Disney-branded juice products and will distribute the same in the UAE and Oman.


Government Regulation
 
We are subject to the laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.
 
Our food products are subject to local, national and multinational regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting the manufacturing plants and facilities of our suppliers, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental review.
 
Examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include selective food taxes, labeling requirements such as front-of-pack labeling and nutrient profiling, marketing restrictions, potential withdrawal of trade concessions as dispute settlement retaliation and sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials. We will continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations.
 
In addition, we are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) which prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. We are also subject to the Export Sales Reporting Program of the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) which monitors U.S. agricultural export sales on a daily and weekly basis. The program requires U.S. exporters to report sales of certain commodities to the Foreign Agricultural Service of the USDA on a weekly basis. Commodities currently covered by the program include wheat, wheat products, barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, rye, rice, soybeans, soybean cake and meal, soybean oil, cotton, cottonseed, cottonseed cake and meal, cottonseed oil, sunflowerseed oil, flaxseed, linseed oil, cattle hides and skins, beef and pork. In addition to the weekly requirement, daily reporting is required when a single exporter sells 100,000 metric tons or more of wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, soybeans, soybean cake or soybean meal, or 20,000 metric tons or more of soybean oil, to a single destination on a single day. In addition to the foregoing, we must comply with The Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanctions. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals targeted against foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other threats to national security, foreign policy or economy of the United Stated.
 
Our failure to comply with any of the foregoing regulations or regulations that we may be subject to may be punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions and asset seizures as well as criminal fines and imprisonment.
 
Market and Competition
 
We generate a majority of our revenue from food imported into the GCC countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The GCC has highly developed wholesale, grocery, and retail infrastructures that attract thousands of brands from around the world. According to A.T. Kearney, there are approximately 600 food distributors in the GCC. According to a 2017 report published by Alpen Capital, food imports into the GCC are expected to reach $53.1 billion by 2020. In addition, according to Global Islamic Economy Gateway, imports account for about 78% of food consumed in the GCC.


In the branded product space, management believes that our key competitors include The Savola Group and Almarai which are based in Saudi Arabia; Americana Quality which is based in Kuwait; and Al Islami Foods which is based in the UAE, which currently ranks as the world’s largest Halal food vendor, with more than 80 frozen and specialty lines. In addition to the foregoing, we also compete with recognized international brands from multi-line companies such as Nestle and Mondelez International.
 
Although many of our competitors have greater financial, distribution and marketing resources than us, management believes there are many food categories and niches in which we can successfully compete in this highly-fragmented market. In addition, we focus on the regional sensitivities and dietary requirements of the markets we export products to. We offer both Verus Foods-branded products along with products from other brands, particularly from brands that desire to enter the GCC market, but lack the infrastructure or resources to do so. In addition to the foregoing, management believes that we are one of the only U.S. based public companies operating in the GCC that can provide its own branded products and also act as a distributor for other brands across all of the major food sales categories. Management believes that a majority of the suppliers in this space are either non-U.S. based, private companies or are public entities with a narrow focus on their own brands. 
 
Employees
