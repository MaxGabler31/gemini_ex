Overview
Alico is an agribusiness with a legacy of achievement and innovation in citrus and conservation. The Company owns approximately 117,000 acres of land in eight Florida counties (Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands and Polk) including approximately 90,000 acres of mineral rights. Our principal lines of business are citrus groves and conservation. 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, the Company acquired three Florida citrus properties for total consideration of approximately $363,000,000. These acquisitions made Alico one of the largest citrus producers in the United States of America.
Alico, Inc. operates two divisions: Alico Citrus, a citrus producer, and Alico Water Resources, a leading water storage and environmental services division.
The Company manages its land based upon its primary usage and reviews its performance based upon two primary classifications - Alico Citrus and Alico Water Resources and Other Operations. Other Operations includes lease for grazing rights, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine and leases of oil extraction rights to third parties, farm lease revenue, the generation of revenues from sod and tree sales and rental income for office space. Alico presents its financial results and the related discussion based upon its two business segments: (i) Alico Citrus and (ii) Water Resources and Other Operations. 
Recent Developments
Water Storage Contract Approval
In December 2012, the South Florida Water Management District (“SFWMD” or "District") issued a solicitation request for projects to be considered for the Northern Everglades Payment for Environmental Services Program ("Program"). In March 2013, the Company submitted its response proposing a dispersed water management project on a portion of its ranch land. The environmental services project ("Water Project") encompasses a large-scale water storage/nutrient load reduction project over approximately half of the Company's 72,000-acre ranch located in southern Hendry County. The Water Project has the ability to retain 94,000-acre feet of water, making it one of the largest private storage projects proposed to date and the largest within the Caloosahatchee River watershed. The Water Project was approved by the South Florida Water Management District in late 2014, and the Company's engineering and environmental consultants immediately began working on a detailed design. As a result of the uniqueness of the project site, which consists of over 11,000 acres of wetlands and several cultural resource sites, considerable effort has been undertaken over the past 3.5 years in securing necessary regulatory approvals for the project from both the State of Florida and the federal government. In addition, the project requires close coordination with adjacent landowners, as well as the water control districts that serve those landowner/properties. On September 29, 2015, the SFWMD amended the contract to extend it for an additional year. In 2016, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection included the project in the State’s Northern Everglades Public-Private Partnership Program.
The contract term is eleven years and allows up to one year for implementation (design, permitting, construction and construction completion certification) and ten years of operation, whereby the Company will provide water retention services. Payment for these services includes an amount not to exceed $4,000,000 of reimbursement for implementation. In addition, the contract provides an annual fixed payment of $12,000,000 for operations and maintenance costs, as long as the project is in compliance with the contract and subject to annual District Board approval of funding. The contract specifies that the District Board has to approve 
1

the payments annually through its budget process and there can be no assurance that it will approve the annual fixed payments. The Florida budget for the state’s 2018/2019 fiscal year as approved included Save Our Everglades trust/legacy Florida funding for the Program. On September 19, 2018 the SFWMD issued a press release announcing the issuance of an Environmental Resource Permit for Alico. The SFWMD release also stated that (i) the issuance of the permit cleared the path for Alico to deliver a dispersed water storage project in the Caloosahatchee Watershed, (ii) Alico has all necessary state approvals to proceed, and (iii) the project is expected to be operational within one year from the start of construction, which is contingent on Alico securing additional local and federal approvals. These approvals include a compatible use agreement from the Natural Resources Conservation Service, as well as approvals from the local water control districts. Construction will begin immediately upon receipt of permits. Annual fixed payments will not commence until completion of construction. The Company anticipates receiving all necessary regulatory approvals within the next four to six months. The Company has not recognized any revenue to date from the contract. Operating expenses were approximately $1,619,000, $1,794,000 and $2,322,000 for each of the three years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Tender Offer
On September 5, 2018, the Board of Directors approved and Alico announced the commencement of an issuer offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase up to $19,999,990 in value of shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $34.00 per share. On October 3, 2018, upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Offer to Purchase dated September 5, 2018, Alico repurchased an aggregate of 752,234 shares at a price of $34.00 per share aggregating $25,575,956. These shares represented approximately 9.2% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding as of October 2, 2018. Included in the 752,234 shares were 163,999 shares that the Company elected to purchase pursuant to its right to purchase up to an additional 2% of its outstanding shares of common stock. 734 Investors, LLC, Alico’s largest stockholder since 2013, participated in the Tender Offer and sold a small percentage of its holdings of the Company’s common stock. Members of neither the management team nor the Board of Directors sold any shares directly to the Tender Offer.
Hurricane Irma
Florida’s citrus industry was hit hard by the impacts of Hurricane Irma during the 2017-2018 season. Alico’s 2018 production was down by approximately 36% from the prior season. While we lost a small percentage of trees, the force and duration of the storm impacted the majority of the groves. Based upon prior experience with serious storms of this nature, we expect it will take at least two seasons for the groves to recover to pre-hurricane production levels. We finished with production of 4,827,000 boxes in fiscal year 2018 and anticipate an increase in production in fiscal year 2019 to 6,300,000-6,600,000 boxes and a return to pre-hurricane production levels by fiscal year 2020, which is approximately 7,900,000 boxes.
Through November 30, 2018, the Company received insurance proceeds relating to Hurricane Irma of approximately $477,000 for property and casualty damage claims and approximately $8,952,000 for crop claims, which have been recorded in operating expenses. The Company has additional property and casualty claims outstanding and is awaiting determination of additional proceeds, if any, to be received. In addition to the commercial insurance claims which have been submitted, the Company may be eligible for Irma federal relief programs distributed by the Farm Service Agency under the 2017 Wildfires and Hurricane Indemnity Program (2017 WHIP) as well as block grants that will be administered through the State of Florida. The specifics of the programs are still being finalized and at this time, the Company cannot determine the amount of federal relief funds which will be received or when these funds will be disbursed.
Alico 2.0 Modernization Program
On November 16, 2017, we announced the Alico 2.0 Modernization Program (“Alico 2.0”). This program is transforming three legacy businesses (Alico, Orange Co., and Silver Nip) into a single efficient enterprise, Alico Citrus, so we will remain one of the leaders in the U.S. citrus industry. This initiative explored every aspect of Alico’s citrus and ranch operations, including corporate and operational cost structures, grove costs, purchasing and procurement, non-performing and under-performing assets, professional fees, and human resources efficiency.
Under this program, we expected to reduce citrus total expenses per acre to $2,164/acre and the cost to produce a pound solid to $1.56 when Alico 2.0 is fully implemented in 2020. These efficiencies are being achieved through better purchasing, more precise application of selected fertilizers and chemicals, outsourcing work such as harvesting, hauling, and certain caretaking tasks, and by streamlining grove management. We have also deployed a more efficient labor model that is consistent and uniform for field staffing and grove operating programs and aligns with the geographical footprint of the citrus groves. 
In combination with these efforts, the Company is working to maintain operational efficiencies and deploy its resources to solidify the Company's position as a leader in the recovering citrus industry.

Alico 2.0 also led us to decide to divest assets that generated low rates of return and shut down parts of our operations that were not profitable. Alico Citrus has shut down its nursery in Gainesville, Florida, is in the process of selling its trailers and has either sold or is in the process of selling real estate assets that are not strategic to our business plan. 
In January 2018, the Company sold its breeding herd and leased grazing rights on the Alico Ranch to a third party operator. However, the Company continues to own the property and continues to conduct its long-term water dispersement program and wildlife management programs. As part of the sales transaction, the Company expensed all inventory costs that were accumulated at the date of sale.
Alico 2.0 also included an enhanced program to plant more citrus trees. The Company planted over 400,000 trees in fiscal year 2018 to help position the Company for future production growth beyond 2020. The Company believes that its current acreage can produce 10,000,000 boxes per year on a sustained basis, even in an environment where citrus greening continues.
Termination Proceedings against Mr. Remy W. Trafelet
On November 19, 2018, Alico, with unanimous approval of the members of the Board of Directors, other than Remy W. Trafelet, notified Mr. Trafelet, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, that it intends to consider terminating his employment for “cause” pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement with the Company and option agreements entered into under the Company's Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (collectively, the “Compensation Documents”). As required by the Compensation Documents, the Company will schedule a special meeting of the Board of Directors at a future date, at which meeting Mr. Trafelet and his counsel (if he so elects) may meet with the Board of Directors to address this matter. The Board of Directors will make its final determination as to Mr. Trafelet’s employment following such meeting. Mr. Trafelet has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of these proceedings. On November 28, 2018, the parties in the Florida Litigation (as defined below) stipulated to an order which provides, among other things, that pending the resolution of the Delaware Litigation (as defined below), the Board of Directors shall not take any action out of the routine day-to-day operations conducted in the ordinary course of business, including removing any corporate officers or directors from positions held as of November 27, 2018. For more information, see Item 3, "Legal Proceedings."
Appointment of Interim President
In connection with the commencement of the termination proceedings against Mr. Trafelet, Benjamin D. Fishman, a current member of the Board of Directors, was appointed to serve as Interim President of the Company, effective as of November 19, 2018. Henry R. Slack, the Company's Executive Chairman, and Mr. Fishman will manage the Company during the pendency of the termination proceedings. Neither Mr. Slack nor Mr. Fishman will receive any incremental compensation for their service during this period. In connection with assuming such interim role, Mr. Fishman has stepped down from the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and Mr. Andrew Krusen has assumed the Chairmanship of the Audit Committee.
Operating Segments

Operating segments are defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") - Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") ASC Topic 280, "Segment Reporting" as components of public entities that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and which is evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 the Company’s CODM assessed performance and allocated resources based on two operating segments: (i) Alico Citrus and (ii) Water Resources and Other Operations. 

Commencing in Alico's fiscal year 2018, the Company operates two business segments related to its various land holdings, as follows:


• | Alico Citrus includes activities related to planting, owning, cultivating and/or managing citrus groves in order to produce fruit for sale to fresh and processed citrus markets, including activities related to the purchase and resale of fruit and value-added services, which include contracting for the harvesting, marketing and hauling of citrus.


• | Water Resources and Other Operations consists of activities related to water conservation, leasing of grazing rights, mining royalties and other less significant lines of business. Also included are activities related to owning and/or leasing improved farmland. Improved farmland is acreage that has been converted, or is permitted to be converted, from native pasture and which may have various improvements including irrigation, drainage and roads.

Prior to the sale of the breeding herd in January 2018, the Company’s business also included cattle ranching.

The Land We Manage
We regularly review our land holdings to determine the best use of each parcel based upon our management expertise. Our total return profile is a combination of operating income potential and long-term appreciation. Land holdings not meeting our total return criteria are considered surplus to our operations and will be sold or exchanged for land considered to be more compatible with our business objectives and total return profile. 
Our land holdings and the operating activities in which we engage are categorized in the following table:

 | Gross Acreage | Operating Activities
Alico Citrus | | | 
Citrus Groves | 44,983 | | Citrus Cultivation 
Citrus Nursery | 22 | | Citrus Tree Development 
 | 45,005 | | 
Water Resources and Other Operations | | 
Ranch | 70,322 | | Leasing and Conservation
Other Land | 1,434 | | Mining lease; Office 
Total | 116,761 | | 

Alico Citrus
We own and manage citrus land in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties and engage in the cultivation of citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the fresh and processed citrus markets. Alico citrus groves total approximately 45,000 gross acres or 38.5% of our land holdings. 

Our citrus acreage is detailed in the following table:

 | Net Plantable | | | 
 | Producing | Developing | Fallow | Total Plantable | Support & Other | Gross
DeSoto County | 14,980 | | 1,096 | | 482 | | 16,558 | 4,650 | 21,208
Polk County | 4,576 | | — | | — | | 4,576 | 2,229 | 6,805 
Collier County | 4,261 | | — | | — | | 4,261 | 2,905 | 7,166 
Hendry County | 3,546 | | 57 | | 175 | | 3,778 | 1,707 | 5,485 
Charlotte County | 1,729 | | — | | 138 | | 1,867 | 676 | 2,543 
Highlands County | 1,063 | | — | | — | | 1,063 | 161 | 1,224 
Hardee County | 403 | | — | | — | | 403 | 171 | 574 
Total | 30,558 | | 1,153 | | 795 | | 32,506 | 12,499 | 45,005

Of the approximately 45,000 gross acres of citrus land we own and manage, approximately 12,500 acres are classified as support acreage. Support acreage includes acres used for roads, barns, water detention, water retention and drainage ditches integral to the cultivation of citrus trees, but which are not capable of directly producing fruit. In addition, we own a small citrus tree nursery and utilize the trees produced in our own operations. The approximately 32,500 remaining acres are classified as net plantable acres. Net plantable acres are those that are capable of directly producing fruit. These include acres that are currently producing, acres that are developing (acres that are planted with trees too young to commercially produce fruit) and acres that are fallow.
Our Alico Citrus business segment cultivates citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the processed and fresh citrus markets. Our sales to the processed market were approximately 93.7%, 91.7% and 86.9% of Alico Citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We produce Early and Mid-Season varieties, primarily Hamlin oranges, as well as a Valencia variety for the processed market. We deliver our fruit to the processors in boxes which each contains approximately 90 pounds of oranges. Because the processors convert the majority of the citrus crop into orange juice, they generally do not buy their citrus on a per box basis, but rather on a pound solids basis, which is the measure of the soluble solids (sugars and acids) 
4

contained in one box of citrus fruit. We produced approximately 26,513,000, 42,611,000, and 51,404,000 pound solids for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, from boxes delivered to processing plants of approximately 4,702,000, 7,259,000 and 8,829,000, respectively. As previously indicated, the falloff is fiscal year 2018 was in large part attributable to the impact of Hurricane Irma.
The average pound solids per box was 5.64, 5.87 and 5.82 for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
We generally use multi-year contracts with citrus processors that include pricing structures based on a minimum (“floor”) price with a price increase (“rise”) based on market conditions. Therefore, if pricing in the market is favorable relative to our floor price, we benefit from the incremental difference between the floor and the final market price.
Our citrus produced for the processed citrus market in fiscal year 2018-2019 under our largest agreement will be under minimum floor price ranging from $2.05 to $2.15 per pound solid and rise price from $2.50 to $2.65 per pound solid. Under this agreement, if the market price exceeds the rise prices, then 50% of the excess will be added to the rise price. Under our next largest agreement, our citrus produced will be under a minimum floor price of $2.60 per pound solid and rise price of $3.30 per pound solid. We believe that other markets are available for our citrus products; however, new arrangements may be less favorable than our current contracts.
Our sales to the fresh citrus market constituted approximately 2.6%, 4.6% and 3.8% of our Alico Citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We produce numerous varieties for the fresh fruit market including grapefruit, navel and other fresh varieties. Generally, our fresh fruit is sold to packing houses by the box and the packing houses are responsible for the harvest and haul of these boxes. We produced approximately 125,000, 328,000 and 402,000 fresh fruit boxes for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The majority of our citrus harvested for the fresh citrus market in fiscal year 2018-2019 is under fixed price contracts.
Revenues from our Alico Citrus operations were approximately 96.1%, 95.1% and 95.2% of our total operating revenues for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Water Resources and Other Operations
We own and manage land in Collier, Glades, and Hendry Counties and engaged in cattle grazing and sales, sod and native plant sales, and still continue with land leasing for recreational and grazing purposes, conservation, and mining activities. Our Water Resources and Other Operations land holdings total approximately 72,000 gross acres, or 61.5% of our total acreage.
Our Water Resources and Other Operations acreage is detailed in the following table as of September 30, 2018:

 | Acreage
Hendry County | 67,208 
Glades County | 526 
Collier County | 4,022 
Total | 71,756 

In January 2018, the Company sold its breeding herd and leased grazing rights on the Alico Ranch to a third party operator. The
Company continues to own the property and conduct its long-term water dispersement program and wildlife management programs. As part of the sales transaction, the Company expensed all cattle inventory costs that were accumulated at the date of sale.
In fiscal year 2017, our cattle operation was engaged in the production of beef cattle in Hendry and Collier Counties. The breeding herd consisted of approximately 8,700 cows and bulls. We primarily sold our calves to feed yards and yearling grazing operations in the United States. We also sold cattle through local livestock auction markets and to contract cattle buyers in the United States. These buyers provided ready markets for our cattle. Revenues from Water Resources and Other Operations were approximately 3.9%, 4.9% and 4.8% of total operating revenues for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Our Strategy
Our core business strategy is to maximize stockholder value through continuously improving the return on our invested capital, either by holding and managing our existing land through skilled agricultural production, leasing, or other opportunistic means 
5

of monetization, disposing of under productive land or business units and acquiring new land or operations with appreciation potential.
Our objectives are to produce the highest quality agricultural products, create innovative land uses, opportunistically acquire and convert undervalued assets, sell under-productive land and other assets not meeting our total return profile, generate recurring and sustainable profit with the appropriate balance of risk and reward, and exceed the expectations of stockholders, customers, clients and partners.
Our strategy is based on best management practices of our agricultural operations and the environmental and conservation stewardship of our land and natural resources. We manage our land in a sustainable manner and evaluate the effect of changing land uses while considering new opportunities. Our commitment to environmental stewardship is fundamental to the Company’s core beliefs.
Seasonal Nature of Business
As with any agribusiness enterprise, our agribusiness operations and revenues are predominantly seasonal in nature. The following table illustrates the seasonality of our agribusiness revenues: 

 | Fiscal Year 
 | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 
 | Ending 12/31 | Ending 3/31 | Ending 6/30 | Ending 9/30
 | Oct | Nov | Dec | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sept
Harvest Fresh and Early/Mid Varieties of Oranges | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Harvest Valencia Oranges | | | | | | | | | | | | 

Significant Customers
Revenue from Tropicana represented approximately 87%, 86% and 32.5% of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The revenue in fiscal year 2018 from Tropicana was generated primarily from two separate contracts. This revenue was generated from the sale of our citrus product in the processed market. No other customer provided more than 6% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2018 or 2017. In the fiscal year 2016, 34.2% of the revenue was obtained through Minute Maid.
Competition 
The orange and specialty citrus markets are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the production of most agricultural commodities. Citrus is grown domestically in several states including Florida, California, Arizona and Texas, as well as foreign countries, most notably Brazil. Competition is impacted by several factors including quality, production, demand, brand recognition, market prices, weather, disease, export/import restrictions and foreign currency exchange rates.
Environmental Regulations 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. Management believes we are in compliance with all such rules including permitting and reporting requirements. Historically, compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. In addition, we require lessees of our property to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing.

Employees 
As of September 30, 2018, we had 233 full-time employees. Our employees work in the following divisions: 

Alico Citrus | 212
Water Resources and Other Operations | 0 
Corporate, General, Administrative and Other | 21 
Total employees | 233

None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Capital Resources and Raw Materials 
Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, and over the long term, through internally generated funds, cash flows from operations, the sale of under-productive land and other assets, our existing lines of credit and access to capital markets. The Company has commitments that provide for lines of revolving credit that are available for our general and corporate use. 
Raw materials needed to cultivate the various crops grown by the Company consist primarily of fertilizers, herbicides and fuel and are readily available from local suppliers.
