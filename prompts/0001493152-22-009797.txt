ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
1. Organizational History
 
The Company was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of New York on June 17, 2005 as “Vycor Medical LLC”. On August 14, 2007, we converted into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to “Vycor Medical, Inc.” (“Vycor”). The Company’s listing went effective on February 2009 and on November 29, 2010 Vycor completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of NovaVision, Inc. (“NovaVision”) and on January 4, 2012 Vycor, through its wholly-owned NovaVision subsidiary, completed the acquisition of all the shares of Sight Science Limited (“Sight Science”), a previous competitor to NovaVision.
2. Overview of Business
 
Vycor is dedicated to providing the medical community with innovative and superior surgical and therapeutic solutions and operates two distinct business units within the medical device industry. Vycor Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery. NovaVision provides non-invasive rehabilitation therapies for those who have vision disorders resulting from neurological brain damage such as that caused by a stroke. Both businesses adopt a minimally or non-invasive approach. The Company has 67 issued or allowed patents and a further 10 pending. The Company leverages joint resources across the divisions to operate in a cost-efficient manner.
 
The Company periodically engages in discussions with potential strategic partners for or purchasers of each or both of our operating divisions. In April 2020, the board of Vycor took the decision to close the German operations of NovaVision, including the German office and NovaVision GmbH, and instead migrate to a licensed business model; in June 2020 Vycor announced that it would be entering into a license agreement and transition agreement (the “Agreements”) with HelferApp GmbH, a cognitive therapy specialist. Under the Agreements, HelferApp is licensed to provide NovaVision’s products and therapies in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to patients and professionals. The NovaVision German office was closed effective June 30, 2020.
 
Vycor Medical
 
Vycor Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery. Vycor Medical’s ViewSite Brain Access System (“VBAS”) is a next generation retraction and access system. Vycor Medical is ISO 13485:2016 and MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program) certified, and VBAS has U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance and CE Marking for Europe (Class III) for brain and spine surgeries, and regulatory approvals in a number of other international markets. Vycor Medical has 29 granted and 10 pending patents.
 
NovaVision
 
NovaVision provides non-invasive, computer-based rehabilitation therapies targeted at people who have impaired vision as a result of stroke or other brain injury, and has 38 granted patents.

Strategy
 
The Company is continuing to execute on a plan to achieve revenue growth and a reduction in annual cash operating losses1 and generated a small cash operating profit1 during the year ended December 31, 2021. For Vycor Medical this plan includes: increasing market penetration in the US; increasing international growth in territories where we are not represented or under-represented and continued new product development in response to market demands and demonstrating applicability in a broader range of pathologies. In the US the Company is focused on increasing market penetration through targeting neurosurgeons systematically, both through its distribution network and also directly by leveraging existing KOL neurosurgeon VBAS supporters to access new neurosurgeon users.
 
The Company continues to target key international territories including Europe where it intends to drive adoption of its VBAS product through selected key KOL neurosurgeon VBAS users in each territory to identify both new potential users and also high-quality distribution partners to bolster our existing network.
 
The Company has for some time been working to better integrate its VBAS with neuronavigation. The first phase of the modification of the existing VBAS product range was completed in September 2017 and has been well received by surgeons. The second phase involves the introduction of an optional Alignment Clip accessory that will snap onto the VBAS and allow for a neuronavigation pointer to be fully integrated into the body of the VBAS. This VBAS AC model range has received US FDA 510(k) clearance, EU clearance and is going through the regulatory process elsewhere internationally; it is envisaged that it will be available during 2022. The Company will continue to work with neuronavigation companies to seek ways to further integrate the VBAS with neuronavigation and with other companies with complementary technologies used in neurosurgery. We will also be exploring with neurosurgeons and focus groups additional selected development work targeted at increasing the ease and applicability of our products to additional common procedures.
 
For NovaVision, given the company’s resources, and the large size and diversity of its end markets, we believe that the most efficient way to tackle the distribution of its broad range of patient and professional products is by partnering with entities in selected geographies that have either direct access to the end users or a desire and financial wherewithal to leverage the NovaVision therapy platform, including into new areas. As a result, the Company closed the NovaVision German office and entered into a license agreement with HelferApp, a cognitive therapy specialist, for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and is seeking similar partnerships in other territories with regional companies able to leverage NovaVision’s clinically supported vision therapies. Management is also open to a broad range of alternatives for NovaVision as a whole, which could comprise distribution and marketing partnerships, licensing, merger or sale.

We are committed to an integrated total quality management system. We believe that we have completed the necessary procedures and Vycor Medical is certified to the ISO standards expected of medical device manufacturers as follows:

The certification of a quality management system to ISO 1348:2016, specifically for medical devices, is advantageous and often essential for medical companies to export their products to the global market, as well as maintain and enter into certain agreements and business growth opportunities within the U.S. For example, Canada requires that medical device manufacturers marketing their products in Canada must have a quality system certified to ISO 13485:2016 and from January 1, 2019 also be certified to MDSAP. The certification is also required for placement of branded devices into the European Union.
