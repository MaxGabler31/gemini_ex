Item 1. Business
Overview
The Partnership was formed in April 2013 by Ciner Holdings. The Partnership owns a controlling interest comprised of 51.0% membership interest in Ciner Wyoming, which is one of the largest and lowest cost producers of natural soda ash in the world, serving a global market from our facility in the Green River Basin of Wyoming. Our facility has been in operation for more than 50 years.
The following table sets forth certain operating data regarding our business:
 | Year Ended December 31, 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
Operating and Other Data: | (thousands of short tons, except for ratio data)
Trona ore consumed | 4,018.3 | | | 4,001.3 | | 4,050.4 | | | 4,040.3 | | 3,869.5 | 
Ore to ash ratio(1) | 1.54: 1.0 | | | 1.50: 1.0 | | 1.50: 1.0 | | | 1.52: 1.0 | | 1.52: 1.0 | 
Ore grade(2) | 85.8 | % | | 88.4 | % | 87.5 | % | | 85.8 | % | 86.4 | %
Soda ash volume produced | 2,613.4 | | | 2,666.9 | | 2,695.3 | | | 2,662.9 | | 2,543.9 | 
Soda ash volume sold | 2,613.2 | | | 2,705.4 | | 2,735.7 | | | 2,655.4 | | 2,548.3 | 


(1) | Ore to ash ratio expresses the number of short tons of trona ore used to produce one short ton of soda ash and liquor and includes our deca rehydration recovery process. In general, a lower ore to ash ratio results in lower costs and improved efficiency. 


(2) | Ore grade is the percentage of raw trona ore that is recoverable as soda ash free of impurities. A higher ore grade will produce more soda ash than a lower ore grade. 

Trona, a naturally occurring soft mineral, is also known as sodium sesquicarbonate and consists primarily of sodium carbonate, or soda ash, sodium bicarbonate and water. We process trona ore into soda ash, which is an essential raw material in flat glass, container glass, detergents, chemicals, paper and other consumer and industrial products. The vast majority of the world’s accessible trona reserves are located in the Green River Basin. According to historical production statistics, approximately one-quarter of global soda ash is produced by processing trona, with the remainder being produced synthetically through chemical processes. The processing of soda ash from trona is the cheapest manner in which to produce soda ash. The costs associated with procuring the materials needed for synthetic production are greater than the costs associated with mining trona for trona-based production. In addition, trona-based production consumes less energy and produces fewer undesirable by-products than synthetic production.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths better enable us to execute our business strategies and to achieve our objective of generating and growing cash available for distribution to our unitholders:
Safety Is a Value and the Most Important Part Of Our Business. We pride ourselves on our safety record, and we are continually one of the leaders in the U.S. mining industry in relation to low incident rates and workplace injuries. We maintain a rigorous safety program, which includes training, site audits and hazard identification. Ciner Corp and its affiliates, our employees and all contractors who operate our assets or work at our facility are involved in our safety programs. As a direct result of this commitment, we have achieved many recognitions such as the Sentinels of Safety by the National Mining Association, The Industrial Minerals Association-North America Safety Achievement Award (Large Category) three times, Safe Sam Award by the Wyoming Mining Association, and the Wyoming State Mine Inspector’s Large Mine award multiple times. During the year ended December 31,

2018, our facility had zero lost work day injuries and two recordable injuries as reported by MSHA. We also boast and support some of the nation’s best mine rescue teams. In 2018, we were awarded MSHA’s Overall Mine Rescue Championship.  This MSHA sponsored competition includes over 40 mine rescue teams from around the country.  
Cost Advantages of Producing Soda Ash from Trona.    We believe that as a producer of soda ash from trona, we have a significant competitive advantage compared to the synthetically produced soda ash manufactured in other parts of the world. The manufacturing and processing costs for producing soda ash from trona are lower than other manufacturing techniques partly because the costs associated with procuring the materials needed for synthetic production are greater than the costs associated with mining trona for trona-based production. In addition, we believe trona-based production consumes less energy and produces fewer undesirable by-products than synthetic production. We believe the average cost of production per short ton of soda ash (before freight and logistics costs) from trona is approximately 40% to 50% the cost per short ton of soda ash from synthetic production. In addition, synthetic producers of soda ash incur additional costs associated with storing or disposing of, or attempting to resell, the by-products the synthetic processes produce. Even after taking into account the higher freight costs associated with our soda ash exports, we believe we can be cost competitive with synthetic soda ash operations in most parts of the world, which are typically located closer to customers than we are. Today, we estimate that roughly 25% of global production is produced from trona based sources, while 75% is produced using various synthetic methods.
Synergies created from Ciner Group.    Since Ciner Group’s acquisition of our business, Ciner Group is now the largest global producer of natural soda ash derived from trona-based sources, with production assets in both Turkey and the US. Ciner Group has long-standing relationships with many global customers that we believe will improve our positioning with key customer accounts in North America and Europe. Ciner Group also owns and operates port facilities in Turkey, and one of its other North American subsidiaries entered into an agreement in 2017 to exclusively import soda ash into a port on the east coast of the U.S. Ciner Corp, which is the exclusive sales agent for the Partnership, will serve as the exclusive sales agent of that material and receive a commission on those sales. We believe by having access to that material, Ciner Corp will be able to offer its customers an improved level of service, greater certainty of supply to the Partnership’s end customers, and over time lower our overall costs to serve and subsequently charged to the Partnership. In addition, we believe there are opportunities to leverage technologies across the group to enhance our relative competitive cost position.
Substantial Reserve Life from Significant Reserves.  Our reserve estimate, as of December 31, 2018, was prepared by our internal staff of mine engineers (the “Ciner Resources staff”). As of December 31, 2018, the Ciner Resources staff estimated we had proven and probable reserves of approximately 236.1 million short tons of trona, which is equivalent to 128.8 million short tons of soda ash. Based on our current mining rate of approximately 4.0 million short tons of trona per year, we believe we have enough proven and probable trona reserves to continue mining trona using current methods for approximately 59 years. Please see Item 1, Business, “Trona Reserves” and “Risk Factors-Risks Inherent in our Business and Industry - Our reserve data are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions that may change in the future, which could materially and adversely affect the quantities and value of our reserves” for more information. 
Certain Operational Advantages Compared to Other U.S. Trona-Based Producers. We believe we have certain operational advantages over other soda ash producers in the Green River Basin due to the operational characteristics of our facilities as described below. These advantages are manifested in our high productivity and efficiency rates.

• | Location of our mining beds and high purity trona. Our mining beds are located 800 to 1,100 feet below the surface, which is significantly closer to the surface than the mining beds of other operators in the Green River Basin. The relatively shallow depth of our beds compared to other Green River Basin trona mines contributes to favorable ground conditions and improved mining efficiency. We have a competitive advantage because we can mine the trona and roof bolt simultaneously on our continuous miner equipment. In addition, the trona in our mining beds has a higher concentration of soda ash as compared to the trona mined at other locations in the Green River Basin, which is typically imbedded or mixed with greater amounts of halite and other impurities. Our trona ore is generally composed of approximately 80% to 89% pure trona. 


• | Advantageous facility layout. Our surface site includes a high capacity network of ponds that we use to recapture soda ash lost in processing trona through a process we introduced in 2009 called deca rehydration (“DECA”). While other producers in the Green River Basin also utilize deca rehydration, our pond complex enables us to spread deca-saturated water over a large surface area, which facilitates evaporation and access to the resulting deca. Additionally, we can transfer water from one pond to another, a process we call “de-watering,” leaving the first pond dry. De-watering enables us to use front loaders and other hauling equipment to move dry deca from that “de-watered” pond to our processing facility. Other producers in the area instead need to utilize costly dredging techniques to extract deca from their ponds, and the recovered deca is wet, and therefore requires more energy to process than dry deca. Introducing dry deca into our process has also reduced our energy consumption per short ton of soda ash produced. At our current utilization rates we will deplete our DECA supply in 2023. Please read “Risk Factor-Risks Inherent in Our Business and Industry-Our deca stockpiles will substantially deplete by 2023 and our production rates will decline approximately 200,000 short tons per year if we do not make further investments” for more information about this process.

Partly due to these operational advantages over other domestic producers, we believe we have the most efficient soda ash production facility in the Green River Basin both in terms of short tons of soda ash produced per employee and in energy consumed per short ton of soda ash produced. In 2018, we used approximately 3.8 MMBtus of energy per short ton of soda ash processed, as compared to an average of 5.5 MMBtus of energy for the other three operators in the Green River Basin according to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (“WDEQ”) and our internal estimates. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we produced approximately 5,355 short tons of soda ash per employee. 
Stable Domestic Customer Relationships.    We have more than 70 domestic customers in industries such as flat glass, container glass, detergents, chemicals, paper and other consumer and industrial products. We have long-term relationships with many of our customers due to our competitive pricing, reliable shipping and high quality soda ash. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the majority of our domestic net sales were made to customers with whom we have done business for over ten years and their contracts are typically for a one year period. We believe that these relationships promote more stable cash flows. 
Experienced Management and Workforce.    Our facility has been in continuous operation for 56 years. We are able to build on the collective knowledge gained from our experience during this period to continually improve our operations and introduce innovative processes. In addition, many members of Ciner Wyoming’s senior management team have more than 20 years of relevant industry experience. Our executives lead a highly productive workforce with an average tenure of approximately 15.1 years. We believe our institutional knowledge, coupled with the relative seniority of our workforce, engenders a strong sense of teamwork and collegiality, which has led to one of the safest and most efficient operations in the industry today.
Our Business Strategies
Our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows through consistent growth in the production of soda ash, allowing us to make quarterly cash distributions to our common unitholders while growing our business. To achieve our objective, we intend to execute the following key business strategies:
Capitalize on the Growing Demand for Soda Ash. Since 2013, we have invested just over $74.8 million for de-bottlenecking projects that have improved our production capacity by 305,000 tons of soda ash per year. We believe we have further opportunities to debottleneck our facility over the next several years up to a maximum capacity of 2,800,000 tons per year. We are currently evaluating engineering and design options to further expand our capacity up to at least 3,000,000 tons per year. We believe that as one of the leading low-cost producers of trona-based soda ash, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the worldwide growth of soda ash. While consumption of soda ash within the United States is expected to remain relatively stable in the near future, overall worldwide demand for soda ash, based on third-party historical production statistics, is projected to grow from an estimated 59.6 million metric tons (equivalent to approximately 65.7 million short tons) in 2018 to almost 65.7 million metric tons (equivalent to approximately 72.4 million short tons) in 2023, which represents a compounded annual growth rate of 2.5%. Through ANSAC (until December 31, 2021), Ciner Group’s logistics network, as well as our long-standing relationship with domestic customers, we believe that as global demand increases, we will be well positioned to maintain our market share in the principal markets in which we operate. Please read “Customers” below for a discussion about our withdrawal from American Natural Soda Ash Corporation (“ANSAC”).
Continuous Improvement Initiatives to Lower our Operating Expenses and Increase Utilization. We are building a culture of continuous improvement. We commenced initiatives in 2017 that continued into 2018 to improve the consistency of our ore flow to the surface and revamped our preventive maintenance practices. Both of these should lead to lowering our overall cost to produce soda ash and increase the consistency and overall output of our production. In addition, in 2018 we commenced construction on a new electricity/steam cogeneration facility that will provide roughly one-third of our electricity and steam demands. We expect to commence operating the new co-generation facility in the second half of 2019 and lower our annual electricity spend by $7 - 10 million per year once fully operational.
Leverage our Sponsor’s Capability to Build a Global Soda Ash Brand.  Our facility in Wyoming, coupled with Ciner Group’s locations in Turkey, produce more than 7.0 million tons of soda ash, making it the world’s largest producer of low cost natural soda ash. Our sponsor’s platform includes unique low cost technology, logistics assets including ports and bulk ships, and world class cost competitive production assets geographically located to serve most key markets around the world. Starting in 2018, our sponsor has entered into an agreement for a new port on the eastern seaboard of the U.S. to import soda ash for supply to select customers on the east coast. Ciner Corp, which is the sales agent for the Partnership, will serve as the exclusive marketing agent for that material and will have inventory to ship from not only Wyoming, but also this new port on the east coast that will ultimately improve security of supply to our customers in the region. We believe this will help Ciner Corp offer a unique value proposition to our customers and ultimately improve the cash flow and profitability of our domestic business. In addition, upon Ciner Corp’s termination from ANSAC to be effective as of December 31, 2021 (as discussed further under “Customers” below) Ciner Corp will begin marketing soda ash directly into international markets that are currently being served by ANSAC and intends to utilize the distribution network that has already been established by the global Ciner Group. We believe by combining our volumes with Ciner Group’s soda ash exports from Turkey, our withdrawal from ANSAC will allow us to leverage the larger, global Ciner Group soda ash operations, which we expect will eventually lower our cost position and improve our ability to optimize our market share both domestically and internationally.

Maintain Financial Flexibility.  We intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy and conservative capital structure by balancing the funding of expansion capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated operating cash flows and external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt” for additional information.
Expand Operations Strategically.   In addition to capacity expansions and process improvements at our current facility, we plan to grow our business through various methods as they become available to us. This would include acquisitions of other businesses that are involved in mining and processing minerals, such as soda ash, and logistics assets that could improve our efficiencies and grow our cash flows. 
We can provide no assurance that we will be able to utilize our strengths described above. For further discussion of the risks that we face, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Our Organizational Structure
The following chart depicts our ownership structure as of March 8, 2019 and approximate ownership percentages:
Our Operations
Our Green River Basin surface operations are situated on approximately 880 acres in Wyoming, and our mining operations consist of approximately 23,500 acres of leased and licensed subsurface mining area. Our facility is accessible by both road and rail. We use seven large continuous mining machines and fourteen underground shuttle cars in our mining operations. Our processing assets consist of material sizing units, conveyors, calciners, dissolver circuits, thickener tanks, drum filters, evaporators and rotary dryers.

The following map shows the known sodium leasing area within the Green River Basin, including the boundaries of our leased and licensed subsurface mining area:
The Green River Basin geological formation holds the largest, and one of the highest purity, known deposits of trona ore in the world. Our reserves contain trona deposits having a purity between 80% to 89% by weight, which means that insoluble impurities and water make up approximately 11% to 20% of our trona. 
10


Our mining leases and license are located in two mining beds, designated by the U.S. Geological Survey as beds 24 and 25, at depths of 800 to 1100 feet, respectively, below the surface. Mining these beds affords us several competitive advantages. First, the depth of our beds is shallower than other actively mined beds in the Green River Basin, which allows us to use a continuous mining technique to mine trona and roof bolt the ceiling simultaneously. In addition, mining two beds that are on top of one another allows for production efficiencies because we are able to use a single hoisting shaft to service both beds.
The following graphic shows a cross-section of the strategic areas of the Green River Basin where we mine trona:
 Source: Management.
We remove insoluble materials and other impurities by thickening and filtering the liquor. We then add activated carbon to our filters to remove organic impurities, which can cause color contamination in the final product. The resulting clear liquid is then crystallized in evaporators, producing sodium carbonate monohydrate. The crystals are then drawn off and passed through a centrifuge to remove excess water. We then dry the resulting material in a product dryer to form anhydrous sodium carbonate, or soda ash. The resulting processed soda ash is then stored in on-site storage silos to await shipment by bulk rail or truck to distributors and end customers. Our storage silos can hold up to 65,000 short tons of processed soda ash at any given time. Our facility is in good working condition and has been in service for 56 years.
Deca Rehydration.    The evaporation stage of our trona ore processing produces a precipitate and natural by-product called deca. “Deca”, short for sodium carbonate decahydrate, is one part soda ash and ten parts water. Solar evaporation causes deca to crystallize and precipitate to the bottom of the four main surface ponds at our Green River Basin facility. In 2009, we implemented a process called deca rehydration, which enables us to recover soda ash from the deca-rich purged liquor as a by-product of our refining process. We capture the soda ash contained in deca by allowing the deca crystals to evaporate in the sun and separating the dehydrated crystals from the soda ash. We then blend the separated deca crystals with partially processed trona ore at the dissolving stage of our production process described above. This process enables us to reduce our waste storage needs and convert what is typically a waste product into a usable raw material. Please read “Risk Factor-Risks Inherent in Our Business and Industry-Our deca stockpiles will substantially deplete by 2023 and our production rates will decline approximately 200,000 short tons per year if we do not make further investments” for more information about this process. 
Energy Consumption.    We believe we have one of the most efficient mining and soda ash production surface operations in the world. In 2018, we used approximately 3.8 MMBtus of energy in the form of electricity and natural gas to produce each short ton of soda ash. In addition, we believe this to be the lowest energy consumption of any soda ash producer in North America. We and other producers of soda ash in the Green River Basin benefit from relatively low cost and stable supplies of coal and natural gas in Wyoming, which further enhances our competitive cost advantage over other regions of the world. To reduce the impact of the volatility in natural gas prices, we hedge a portion of our natural gas consumption requirements, which enables us to set the price for a portion of our forecasted natural gas purchases. In addition, we have begun installation of a new electricity/steam co-generation 
11


facility that is estimated to reduce our electricity spend by roughly one-third per year. We expect to commence operating the new co-generation facility in the second half of 2019.
Shipping and Logistics.    All of our soda ash is shipped by rail or truck from our Green River Basin operations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we shipped approximately 93.5% of our soda ash to our customers initially via a single rail line owned and controlled by Union Pacific Railroad Company (“Union Pacific”), and our plant receives rail service exclusively from Union Pacific. Our agreement with Union Pacific expires on December 31, 2019 and there can be no assurance that it will be renewed on terms favorable to us or at all. If we do not ship at least a significant portion of our soda ash production on the Union Pacific rail line during a twelve-month period, we must pay Union Pacific a shortfall payment under the terms of our transportation agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we assisted the majority of our domestic customers in arranging their freight services. During 2018, we had no shortfall payments and do not expect to make any such payments in the future. Ciner Corp leases a fleet of more than 2,000 hopper cars that serve as dedicated modes of shipment to our domestic customers. For export, we ship our soda ash on unit trains consisting of more than 100 cars to two primary ports: Port Arthur, Texas and Portland, Oregon. From these ports, our soda ash is loaded onto ships for delivery to ports all over the world. ANSAC currently provides logistics and support services for all of our export sales. For domestic sales, Ciner Corp provides similar services.
Customers
Our largest customer currently is ANSAC, which buys soda ash from us (through Ciner Corp, which serves as our sales agent in our agreement with ANSAC) and other of its member companies for export to its customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, ANSAC accounted for approximately 52.0% of our net sales. No other individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales. ANSAC takes soda ash orders directly from its overseas customers and then purchases soda ash for resale from its member companies pro rata based on each member’s allocated volumes. ANSAC is the exclusive distributor for its members to the markets it serves. However, Ciner Corp, on our behalf, negotiates directly with, and we export to, customers in markets not served by ANSAC. During 2017, international sales were made through ANSAC as well as to Ciner Ic ve Dis Ticaret Anonim Sirketi (“CIDT”), both of which are our export affiliates. We began selling soda ash in late 2016 to CIDT and continued into 2017. There were no sales to CIDT during the year ended December 31, 2018, as the contract terminated in 2017.
For customers in North America, Ciner Corp, on our behalf, typically enters into contracts, having terms ranging from one to three years. Under these contracts, our customers generally agree to purchase either minimum estimated volumes of soda ash or a certain percentage of their estimated soda ash requirements at a fixed price for a given calendar year. Although we do not have a “take or pay” arrangement with our customers, substantially all of our sales are made pursuant to written agreements and not through spot sales. In 2018, we had more than 70 domestic customers and in general, we have long-term relationships with the majority of our customers, meaning we have been a supplier to them for more than ten years.
Our customers, including end users to whom ANSAC makes sales overseas, consist primarily of:

• | Glass manufacturing companies, which account for 50% or more of the consumption of soda ash around the world; and


• | The majority of the remainder is comprised of chemical and detergent manufacturing companies.

On November 9, 2018, we were informed that Ciner Corp had delivered a notice to terminate its membership in ANSAC, a cooperative that serves as the primary international distribution channel for us as well as two other U.S. manufacturers of trona-based soda ash. The effective termination date is December 31, 2021 (the “ANSAC termination date”). ANSAC was our largest customer for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, accounting for 52.0%, 44.7% and 55.2%, respectively, of our net sales. Although ANSAC has been our largest customer for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we anticipate that the impact of such termination on our net sales, net income and liquidity will be limited. We made this determination primarily based upon the belief that we will continue to be one of the lowest cost producers of soda ash in the global market that has historically seen demand for soda ash exceed supply of soda ash, and therefore we anticipate being able to find export customers regardless of market conditions. Between now and the ANSAC Termination Date, Ciner Corp will continue to have full ANSAC membership benefits and services. After the ANSAC Termination Date, we expect Ciner Corp will begin marketing soda ash directly into international markets which are currently being served by ANSAC and intends to utilize the distribution network that has already been established by the global Ciner Group. We believe by combining our volumes with Ciner Group’s soda ash exports from Turkey, our withdrawal from ANSAC will allow us to leverage the larger, global Ciner Group soda ash operations which we expect will eventually lower our cost position and improve our ability to optimize our market share both domestically and internationally. Please read “Risk Factors-Risks Inherent in our Business and Industry-A significant portion of our historical international sales of soda ash have been to ANSAC, and therefore, Ciner Corp’s decision to terminate its membership in ANSAC could adversely affect our ability to compete in certain international markets, materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.”

Leases and License
We are party to several mining leases and one license, as noted in the table below, which give us subsurface mining rights. Some of our leases are renewable at our option upon expiration. We pay royalties to the State of Wyoming, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and Rock Springs Royalty Company LLC (“RSRC”), an affiliate of Anadarko Petroleum, which are calculated based upon a percentage of the value of soda ash and related products sold at a certain stage in the mining process. These royalty payments may be subject to a minimum domestic production volume from our Green River Basin facility. We are also obligated to pay annual rentals to our lessors and licensor regardless of actual sales. In addition, we pay a production tax to Sweetwater County, and trona severance tax to the State of Wyoming that is calculated based on a formula that utilizes the volume of trona ore mined and the value of the soda ash produced.
The royalty rates we pay to our lessors and licensor may change upon our renewal or renegotiation of such leases and license. On June 28, 2018, Ciner Wyoming amended its License Agreement, dated July 18, 1961 (the “License Agreement”), with RSRC, to, among other things, (i) extend the term of the License Agreement to July 18, 2061 and for so long thereafter as Ciner Wyoming continuously conducts operations to mine and remove sodium minerals from the licensed premises in commercial quantities; and (ii) revise the production royalty rate for each sale of sodium mineral products produced from ore extracted from the licensed premises at the royalty rate of eight percent (8%) of the net sales of such sodium mineral products. Any increase in the royalty rates we are required to pay to our lessors and licensor, or any failure by us to renew any of our leases and license, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, and, therefore, may affect our ability to distribute cash to unitholders. 
The following is a summary of the material terms of our leases and our license as of December 31, 2018:

Name of Lessor orLicensor | Number ofLeases orLicenses as ofDecember 31,2018 | TotalApproximateAcreage as ofDecember 31,2018 | ExpirationDate Range | Renewals | Year ofCommencement | Royalty Rate 
License with Rock Springs | 1 | 12,445 acres | 2061 | License will renew so long as we continuously conduct operations to mine and remove sodium minerals from the licensed premises in commercial quantities. | 1961 | 8% of net sales 
Leases with the U.S. Government | 4 | 7,934 acres | 2027-2028 | These leases will renew so long as we file an application for renewal with the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, within 90 days of expiration of the leases(1) | 1961 | 6% of gross output
Leases with the State of Wyoming | 5 | 3,079 acres | 2019 | No contractual right to renewal, but leases have been historically renewed for consecutive 10-year periods | 1969 | 6% of gross value 


(1) | Renewals are typically for ten-year periods.

The foregoing descriptions of the material terms of our leases and our license do not purport to be complete descriptions of our leases and our license, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the leases and license,as amedned copies of which have been filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to this Report. See Part IV, Item 15, “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules— Exhibit Index” for more information.
Trona Reserves
As of December 31, 2018, the Ciner Resources Staff had estimated proven and probable reserves of approximately 236.1 million short tons, which is equivalent to 128.8 million short tons of soda ash. The estimates of our proven and probable reserves were prepared by Ciner Resources Internal Staff for the year ended December 31, 2018 based off prior established estimates by a third party. Based on our current mining rate of approximately 4.0 million short tons of trona per year, we have enough proven and probable trona reserves to continue mining trona using current methods for approximately 59 years.
Ciner Resources Staff calculated a mineral reserve estimate on our trona mineral assets, which are contained in beds 24 and 25 of the Green River Basin, at depths of 800 and 1,100 feet below the surface, respectively. The Ciner Resources staff estimates are based on geological data generated from historical exploration drill holes, borings within the mine space, and mine observations and measurements, including core samples. In addition, Ciner Resources Staff reviewed and analyzed our reserve base maps and current mining plans, and developed a life of mine plan with respect to the predicted life of our reserves using a non-subsidence design.

Our trona reserve estimates include reserves that can be economically and legally extracted and processed into soda ash at the time of their determination. Our trona reserves are categorized as “proven (measured) reserves” and “probable (indicated) reserves,” which are defined as follows:

• | Proven (Measured) Reserves—Reserves for which: (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-established.


• | Probable (Indicated) Reserves—Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

For purposes of categorizing our proven reserves, Ciner Resources Staff estimates applied exploration and mine measurements and drill hole data within a one-quarter mile radius, and required at least 8-feet of trona thickness and a trona ore grade of at least 85% (with 15% of clays, shales and other impurities). To assess the economic viability of our reserves, Ciner Resources Staff reviewed our cost of products sold and average sales price of soda ash for the three years ended December 31, 2018.
In determining whether our reserves meet these proven and probable standards, Ciner Resources Staff applied certain assumptions regarding the remaining life of our reserves, including, among other things, that: 

• | our cost of products sold per short ton will remain consistent with our cost of products sold for the three years ended December 31, 2018, which was approximately $80 per short ton of soda ash;


• | the weighted average net sales per short ton will remain consistent with our weighted average net sales price per short ton for three years ended December 31, 2018, which was approximately $181 per short ton of soda ash;


• | we will achieve an annual mining rate of approximately 4.0 million short tons of trona;


• | we will process soda ash with a 90% recovery rate without accounting for our deca rehydration process;


• | the ore to ash ratio for the stated trona reserves is 1.835:1.0 (short tons of trona run-of-mine to short tons of soda ash, excluding our deca rehydration recovery process);


• | our run-of-mine ore estimate contains dilution from the mining process;


• | we will, in approximately 20-30 years, make necessary equipment modifications to operate at a seam height of 7-feet, although our current mining limit is 9.5 to 10 feet;


• | we will, within the next one to six years, conduct “two-seam mining,” which means to perform continuous mining simultaneously on beds 24 and 25 in close proximity;


• | our mining costs will remain consistent with 2018 levels;


• | our processing costs will remain consistent with 2018 levels;


• | we will continue to conduct only conventional mining using the room and pillar method and a non-subsidence mine design;


• | we have and will continue to have valid leases and license in place with respect to the reserves, and that these leases and license can be renewed for the life of the mine based on our extensive history of renewing leases and license;


• | we have and will continue to have the necessary permits to conduct mining operations with respect to the reserves;


• | we will maintain the necessary tailings storage capacity to maintain tailings disposal between the mine and surface placement for the life-of-mine;


• | trona ore grade will be 80 to 89%.

Our reserves are subject to leases with the State of Wyoming and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and a license with Rock Springs. See “Leases and License” above for a summary of these leases and our license, including expiration date ranges.

(1) | For purposes of these estimates, the minimum grade for reported tonnage is 85%.


(2) | The average run-of-mine trona grade, or the percentage of the raw trona mined that comprises soda ash, of our proven and probable trona reserves is approximately 88.9%. These estimates assume out-of-seam dilution of 4 inches. The price used to estimate our proven and probable trona reserves was our historical average CIF (carriage, insurance and freight) sales price for the three years ended December 31, 2018, which was approximately $181 per short ton of soda ash.


(3) | Soda ash conversion assumes a 90% recovery rate, resulting in an ore to ash ratio of 1.835:1.0.


(4) | The sums of some of the rows and columns may not foot due to rounding.


(5) | Except percentages, which are averages.

Our reserve estimates will change from time to time as a result of mining activities, analysis of new engineering and geologic data, modification of mining plans or mining methods and other factors. For additional information, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Risks Inherent in our Business and Industry” for more information regarding risks surrounding our reserves.
Competition
Soda ash is a commodity natural resource traded globally with numerous producers and consumers worldwide. We compete with both North American and international soda ash producers. There are two ways to consider how we compete: (1) versus our fellow North American competitors; and (2) versus our worldwide competitors. Against our principal North American competitors, which include subsidiaries of Genesis, Solvay and Tata in the Green River Basin and Searles Valley Minerals in California, we believe we have a number of competitive advantages, including operational advantages that improve our relative cost position, life of our mineral reserves, our strong safety record, customer relationships and an experienced management team and workforce. Against our principal worldwide competitors, Solvay, Tata and various Chinese producers, virtually all of their production is manufactured from synthetic processes and we believe, as a producer of soda ash from trona, we have competitive advantages, even after considering the fact that we generally have higher logistics costs to move the soda ash from Wyoming to regions around the world. The costs associated with procuring the materials needed for synthetic production are greater than the costs associated with mining trona. In addition, we believe trona-based production consumes less energy and produces fewer undesirable by-products than synthetic production. See “Our Competitive Strengths” above for additional information.
Insurance
Because all of our operations are conducted at a single facility, an event such as an explosion, fire, equipment malfunction or severe weather conditions could significantly disrupt our trona mining or soda ash production operations and our ability to supply soda ash to our customers. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of our surface and subsurface operations. To mitigate this risk, Ciner Enterprises or its affiliates maintains, on our behalf, property, casualty and business interruption insurance in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are adequate for our current operations. We regularly evaluate our policy limits and deductibles as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance coverage to account for changes or growth in our business.
Environmental Matters
Our mining and processing operations, which have been conducted at our Green River Basin facility for many years, are subject to strict regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to protection of the environment. We have a rigorous compliance program to ensure that our facilities comply with environmental laws and regulations. However, we are involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters. Modifications or changes in enforcement of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations in the future, particularly with respect to environmental or 
15


climate change, or changes in the operation of our business or the discovery of additional or unknown environmental contamination, could require expenditures that might be material to our results of operations or financial condition.
We summarize below certain environmental laws applicable to us that regulate discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites, the protection of groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, and climate change. Our failure to comply with any of the below laws may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of clean-up and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations.
Clean Air Act
The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources. Under the Clean Air Act, our facility has been issued a Title V operating permit, which regulates emissions to air from our operations. In particular, our operations are subject to technology-based standards pursuant to the Clean Air Act’s New Source Performance Standards for Nonmetallic Mineral Processing Plants, which limit particulate matter emissions. Under associated Clean Air Act regulations our operation is also subject to Best Available Control Technology (BACT) requirements. In addition, our boilers are subject to technology-based standards pursuant to the Clean Air Act’s National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Source: Industrial, Commercial and Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters, which were published in final form in January 2013. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants.
Clean Water Act
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which we refer to as the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the federal EPA or the state. We do not discharge any wastewater from our operations into the Green River, the nearest river system to our Green River Basin facility. However, the discharge of storm water runoff from our facility is governed by a general permit issued by the WDEQ. In particular, the general permit requires our compliance with a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. We periodically monitor groundwater wells at our processing facility, most of which are proximate to our surface pond complex, for salinity, conductivity and other parameters pursuant to permits issued by the WDEQ. Permitted interceptor trenches are used to collect saline groundwater to prevent discharge and impact to the Green River.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and analogous state laws, impose requirements for the careful generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes. Based on the amount of hazardous waste our operations generate (less than 100 kilograms per month), we have been classified under RCRA as a conditionally exempt small quantity generator. 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA (otherwise known as “Superfund”), and comparable state laws impose liability in connection with the release of hazardous substances into the environment. CERCLA imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and those who disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Wyoming’s Environmental Quality Act also creates the potential for liability in connection with the release of hazardous substances into the environment, and has been construed to impose liability without regard to fault. We have not received notice that we are a potentially responsible party at any Superfund site.

Climate Change Legislation and Regulations
In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, or GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources, including soda ash processors like us. We are monitoring and reporting GHG emissions from our operations, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with the rules. In the past, the U.S. Congress has considered, but not enacted, legislation that would impose requirements to reduce emissions of GHGs. The State of California has enacted regulations establishing a so-called GHG “cap-and-trade” system designed to reduce GHG emissions. Our operations are not currently subject to any federal or state requirement to reduce GHG emissions. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations limiting, or otherwise imposing a tax or financial penalty for, emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations might be material to our results of operations or financial condition.
Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality—Land Quality Division
Our operations are subject to oversight by the Land Quality Division of the WDEQ. In particular, our principal mine permit issued by the Land Quality Division requires us to “self-bond” for the estimated future cost to reclaim the area of our processing facility, surface pond complex and on-site sanitary landfill. As of December 31, 2018, the amount of the self-bond was $32.9 million. The amount of the bond is subject to change based upon periodic re-evaluation by the Land Quality Division. Also, our ability to self-bond may be impacted by future legislation. Please see Item IA, “Risk Factors--Risks Inherent in our Business and Industry--Our inability to acquire, maintain or renew financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.” for more information. 
Mining and Workplace Safety 
 The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, or MSHA, is the primary regulatory organization governing safety matters associated with trona ore mining. Accordingly, MSHA regulates underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with trona ore mines. MSHA administers the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and enforces compliance with that statute’s mandatory safety and health standards. As part of MSHA’s oversight, representatives perform at least four unannounced inspections annually for our entire facility, as well as spot check every five days in our underground facility due to our Green River Basin facility being classified as a gassy mine. For 2018; we averaged 0.32 citations per inspection day, which is below the industry average of 1.26 citations per inspection day.
We also are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. 
Our Green River Basin facility maintains a rigorous safety program. Ciner Corp and its affiliates’ employees and contractors who operate our assets are required to complete 40 hours of initial training, as well as eight-hour annual refresher sessions. These training programs cover all of the potential site-specific hazards present at the facility. As a direct result of our commitment to safety, the Green River Basin facility has had an exceptional safety record in recent years. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our facility had zero lost work-day injuries and two recordable injuries as reported by MSHA. During the five years ended December 31, 2018, the Green River Basin facility averaged 1.0 lost work day injuries per year and averaged 4.6 recordable injuries per year as reported by MSHA, which we believe to be better than the industry average.
Employees/Labor Relations
The personnel who operate our assets are employees of Ciner Corp and its affiliates. Under the joint venture agreement governing Ciner Wyoming, Ciner Wyoming reimburses us for the time and cost of employees who operate our assets and for support provided to Ciner Wyoming. As of December 31, 2018, Ciner Corp and its U.S. affiliates had approximately 488 full-time employees, of which 446 are employees who operate the mine at our facility in the Green River Basin. None of these employees was covered by a collective bargaining agreement as of December 31, 2018. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
In addition, under the Services Agreement, dated October 25, 2015, among the Partnership, our general partner and Ciner Corp (the “Services Agreement”), Ciner Corp has agreed to provide the Partnership with certain corporate, selling, marketing, and general and administrative services, in return for which the Partnership has agreed to pay Ciner Corp an annual management fee and reimburse Ciner Corp for certain third-party costs incurred in connection with providing such services.
