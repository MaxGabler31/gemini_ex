Item 1. Business
Our Company
ARC Document Solutions Inc. is a digital printing company. We provide digital printing and document-related services to customers in a growing variety of industries. Our primary services are:
•digital printing of general and specialized business documents such as those found in marketing and advertising, engineering and construction and other industries, as well as producing highly-customized display graphics of all types and sizes;
•acquiring, placing and managing ARC-certified office printing equipment with proprietary device tracking and print management software at our customers’ offices and job sites;
•scanning documents, indexing them and adding digital search features for use in digital document management, document archives and facilities management, as well as providing other digital imaging services; and,
•reselling digital printing equipment and supplies.
Each of these services frequently include additional logistics services in the form of distributing and delivering finished documents, installing display graphics, or the digital storage of graphic files. 
While our production equipment and services are technologically sophisticated, we have also invested heavily in developing technology applications that improve digital printing and document management, increase the efficiency of print networks, and provide features that enhance cybersecurity. We believe the use of this technology by our customers creates a more valuable relationship.
Our services, technology and national footprint create economies of scale and production efficiency across geographical boundaries for customers who prefer to work with a single supplier for their digital printing needs. We believe these single-source capabilities provide us with a material advantage over our competition in local and regional markets.
We serve more than 40,000 active customers in a wide variety of markets including retail, technology, energy, education, hospitality, public utilities, and others. We also perform work for a majority of the largest design, engineering, and construction-oriented firms in North America. Our largest customers are served by an enterprise sales force called Global Solutions. No individual customer accounts for more than 2.5% of our overall revenue.
We believe that no other public company in the U.S. offers the particular set of services we do. We believe we are the largest digital printing provider to the architectural, engineering and construction industry (AEC) as measured by revenue, number of customers, and number of service centers.
Our employees are generally long-tenured, highly-experienced, and cross-trained. They provide our services from more than 130 service centers located throughout North America and in select locations around the world. All of our service centers can provide the complete array of our general services, but each service center varies in scale, size of labor force and capacity based on the size and needs of its particular market.
Our primary operational objective is to drive as much customer work through our service center network as is practical in order to leverage our production infrastructure, a capable and efficient workforce, and production-grade equipment.
Our services can be customized to meet the needs of individual customers, as well as address the needs of a broad industry, and we have an excellent reputation for service and reliability. Because of our reputation for high level of service and the benefits that our technology brings to our customers, we are able to charge a reasonable premium for our offering. 
Importantly, we don't believe that we should be compared to conventional printers. We do not produce high-volume, low-margin, commodity offset or lithographic printing, but rather provide short-run, customized, high-quality digital printing services. As such, the customers, end-products, production equipment, labor utilization and economic models of conventional printers are materially different than ours.
The Company was founded in 1988, went public and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005, and is headquartered in San Ramon, California. We are a Delaware corporation operating under a single brand, “ARC.” Our corporate name is “ARC Document Solutions, Inc.,” and our NYSE ticker symbol is “ARC.” We conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ARC Document Solutions, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and its affiliates. In the years 
following our inception, our business grew through acquisitions, but for more than a decade acquisitions have not been a focal point for growth. 
Principal Products and Services
Specifically, our offerings include:
Digital Printing: We print documents of any size in color and black and white on a variety of materials including plain paper, vinyl, fabric, metal, wood and other three-dimensional substrates. While we can and do print high-page count work such as manuals or catalogs, the documents we typically produce are usually characterized by their high-quality production, low-volume and quick turnaround, and are produced using highly-sophisticated digital printing equipment.
Managed Print Services: We acquire and manage digital printing equipment and place it in our customers' facilities for their use, based on a service level agreement (SLA). We lease or own the equipment ourselves, while our customers pay for what they use. Per-use minimum charges are often part of our service agreements. We operate more than 10,500 managed print services (MPS) locations, ranging in size from one or two pieces of equipment in a single office, to hundreds of pieces equipment in offices around the world. We also provide proprietary software to our customers to control their print expenses and connect their remote employees with their offices and ARC print centers nationwide. This software is developed and integrated by ARC. 
Scanning and Digital Imaging: We scan hard-copy small format or large format documents in color or black and white, typically providing them to our customers as searchable PDF files. We also use our patented optical character recognition technology to make documents searchable, and we host them on proprietary applications for use as part of our ARC Facilities solutions. The types of documents that we scan include office files, construction plans and other small or large documents. We also process, distribute and print-on-demand images we capture for our customers. Our large, centralized Scanning and Digital Imaging centers are compliant with the Health Insurability Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (HIPAA) so we can convert documents that include protected health information (PHI). Our unique software creates efficient search tags on scanned data for easy search and retrieval. We offer Cloud-based document management software and other digital hosting services to our customers or make files available for our customers to host themselves. 
Equipment and Supplies Sales: We sell equipment and supplies to a small segment of our customer base. We also provide ancillary services such as equipment service and maintenance, often as a way to generate recurring revenue in addition to a one-time sale. In addition, we offer certified used equipment available for sale or for use in our MPS offering. 
In previous years, our services were characterized by the primary industries/markets in which they were meant to be sold, e.g., the construction industry or the document archiving and storage market. Having expanded the variety of the markets and industries we serve over the past several years, we now believe it is more useful to report our services by production method. Specifically, we previously described Digital Printing as “construction document and information management” or “CDIM,” and Scanning and Digital Imaging as “archiving and information management” or “AIM.” 
The methods for financial reporting and revenue recognition in our renamed service lines remain unchanged. Likewise, “Managed Print Services” or “MPS” and “Equipment Sales and Supplies” are also reported identically from previous years.
Operations
The majority of our products and services are available from each of our service centers. As noted earlier, our primary operational objective is to optimize our business performance by driving as much customer work through our service center network as is practical, leveraging our production infrastructure, workforce, and production-grade equipment. All our production centers are digitally connected and we operate standard software and systems to support seamless movement of customers digital data and print anywhere within the ARC system.
In addition, we can provide many of our services in our customers’ offices. Our geographic presence is concentrated in the U.S., with additional service centers in Canada, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), China, India, and the United Kingdom. Our origin as a company was in California, and the initial expansion of our business was concentrated there. We derive approximately 33% of our total revenue from the products and services delivered in California.
All of our production facilities are connected via a Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN). Our cloud offerings are hosted by Amazon Web Services. We employ a combination of proprietary and industry-leading technologies to provide redundancy, backup and security of all data in our systems. All of our technology operations are designed to meet ISO 29001 standards for data security, and several of our service centers are HIPAA-compliant allowing us to manage document conversions and other scanning tasks involving protected health information, or PHI.
In response to the pandemic, most of our corporate, financial and administrative staff have been working entirely or partially from home, while our service center staff continue to work in our facilities and adhere to strict safety and health protocols.
Seasonality is a small part of our business, with sales of Digital Printing for construction clients influenced by seasonality and building cycles. Sales of display graphics are affected by retail trends, marketing calendars, advertising campaigns and branding initiatives, as well as the marketing and communication needs of our office and real estate development clients. 
MPS sales are driven by the generation of office documents and our customers' desire to improve business processes and reduce print-related costs. Scanning and Digital Imaging sales are influenced primarily by the desire for document workflow improvements. Equipment and Supplies sales are driven by purchasing cycles of individual customers, as well as by new features and advancements from equipment manufacturers.
Strategic Focus
Our strategic focus areas include driving profitable growth, optimizing our business performance, and returning value to our shareholders.
Driving profitable growth: We intend to expand the markets and industries we serve while leveraging our long-term relationships with existing customers. Our outside sales efforts are focused on new customers and markets, while existing account-based sales have been generally shifted to in-house service centers where work is performed, and our customer relationships are strongest. 
Optimizing our business performance: We intend to leverage our service centers and cross-trained workforce to create efficiencies in our operations, lower our costs, and provide exceptional service to our customers. We believe that the more work we are able to drive through our service centers, the greater our efficiencies become.
Returning value to our shareholders: We intend to continue focusing our capital allocation strategy on benefiting our shareholders by using our strong cash flows to fund our dividend program and repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market. 
Human Capital Management
We employed approximately 1,700 people as of December 31, 2021. Approximately 75% of our employees are located in the U.S. Approximately 98% of our team are full-time employees, with 65% representing non-exempt roles working in production functions. There are 15 engineers employed in our corporate headquarters in San Ramon, California, to develop, maintain, and support our proprietary software solutions. We also operate a technology center in Kolkata, India, with approximately 180 employees who, in addition to supporting our San Ramon technology team, also support our research and development efforts. Approximately 30 service employees and managers work in our service centers in Canada, 50 in the United Kingdom, and the remaining 200 in India, United Arab Emirates and China. None of our employees are currently represented by labor unions.
We have long embraced inclusion, diversity and equity in our workforce from the top down. Two of our five board members are women. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Operating Officer and our Chief Technology Officer are Southeast Asian, our Chief Financial Officer is Hispanic, and our Corporate Counsel and Corporate Secretary is a woman. Similar racial and gender diversity is represented across our workforce. 
We believe our success is a direct result of the contributions and commitment of our employees. Like most U.S. employers in 2021, ARC adjusted its compensation plans throughout the year to help facilitate employee retention. We also make profit-sharing and incentive plans part of every employee’s compensation package. We believe that profit-sharing plans in particular encourage team efforts and cohesion within local and regional employee groups.
Our employee benefit offerings include price-competitive, high-quality medical insurance plans that include incentives for physical fitness, and we offer mental health and other employee assistance programs. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes to our operating environment to help our employees around the world remain safe. Most of our corporate, financial and administrative staff have been working entirely or partially from home, while our service center staff continue to work in our facilities and adhere to strict safety and health protocols.
We reconfigured our service center production and other areas to ensure sufficient distancing, installed clear barriers at our customer counters and other high-density areas, limited visitor entry where appropriate, and vastly increased virtual meetings.
Our Customers
We serve approximately 40,000 active customers in a wide variety of markets. No single customer accounted for 2.5% or more of our sales in 2021. The size of our customers is wide-ranging, from local restaurant owners and construction subcontractors to international retailers, regional energy companies, and some of the country’s largest school districts. We frequently sell products and services from across our portfolio to a single customer, particularly when working with larger customers. In addition, we often sell similar services to different companies within the same industry. Payment terms for account-based customers typically do not exceed 30 days.
The types of Digital Printing customers we sell to span a wide variety of industries that include but are not limited to:
•advertising/media/marketing/promotional/graphic design departments
•building owners and real estate developers
•design, engineering and construction professionals
•office management & IT departments responsible for print and document management
•facilities management staff in schools, hospitals and other institutions
•procurement departments in businesses of all kinds
•small business owners
•retail merchandising departments, and
•city/county/state municipalities
The local markets we serve through our service centers are often highly fragmented with a wide variety of specialized, geographically-differentiated business practices. Larger regional, national and international customers often consolidate the purchasing and the acquisition of our services through a single corporate department. We serve these larger customers through our enterprise sales force which we refer to as our Global Solutions.
Competition
The level of competition that we face varies in each of our markets, but we believe our service level, the breadth of our offerings, price, quality, responsiveness, and convenience to the customer are common competitive elements in any market.
We often compete with single-service firms, e.g., quick printers, copier dealers or scanning bureaus, but we do not know of any other firm that currently provides the full suite of services we offer.
Local copy shops and self-serve franchises are often aggressive competitors for digital printing business, but rarely offer the breadth of document management and logistics services that we do. 
There are several companies in each major metropolitan market that provide MPS and related print services, but we believe these companies cannot provide the same or similar integrated services and technology that we offer. 
Likewise, there are small and regional scanning companies in many of the markets where we compete, but few have the infrastructure, footprint, stewardship guarantees, and privacy certifications that we do.
With regard to large national and international customers, we know of no other document solutions companies in the U.S. with the national presence and global reach that we have established for each of our primary services. 
We believe that we have a strong competitive position in the markets and industries that we serve for the following reasons:
•Broad expertise in specialized digital printing, finishing and installation.
•Capabilities in a wide variety of digital printing formats including large-format, small-format, black and white, color, as well as print capabilities on conventional substrates (paper and paper-based products) and unconventional substrates (vinyl, fabric, plastic, metal, three-dimensional structures, etc.).
•Strong domain expertise in printing specialty documents, especially in the architectural, engineering and construction industries.
•Long-standing positive customer relationships in every industry we serve.
•High-ranking organic search engine statistics for our primary services.
•Long-term contracts with high-profile, enterprise-level customers that can be leveraged for referral work.
•A large North American service center footprint of more than 130 facilities, with additional market presence in Canada, China, the UAE, India, the U.K. and other select international locations.
•The variety of equipment brands we make available to our customers as compared to the single brands offered by competing equipment manufacturers.
•We believe we are the only national company that integrates digital printing and document production at (1) customer sites (onsite offerings), (2) a national network of service centers (offsite offerings), and (3) digital management of documents in the cloud (cloud-based offerings). 
Suppliers and Vendors
We purchase or lease equipment for use in our production facilities and at our customers’ sites. We also purchase paper, toner and other consumables for the operation of our equipment. As a high-volume purchaser, we believe we receive favorable prices as compared to other service providers. Price increases are typically passed on to customers.
Our primary vendors of equipment, maintenance services, and digital printing supplies include Hewlett Packard, Canon Solutions America (Océ), and Xerox.
Purchases from these vendors during 2021 comprised approximately 40% of our total purchases of inventory and supplies. Although there are a limited number of suppliers that could supply our inventory, we believe any shortfalls from existing suppliers could be filled by other suppliers on comparable terms. 
Proprietary Rights
We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, license agreements, nondisclosure and non-competition agreements, reseller agreements, customer contracts, and technical measures to establish and protect our rights in our proprietary technology. We also rely on a variety of technologies that are licensed from third parties to perform key functions.
