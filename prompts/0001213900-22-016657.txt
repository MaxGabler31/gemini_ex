By utilizing sub licensing arrangements for the intellectual property licenses we acquire, our strategy was focused on identifying strategic partners that can develop and market products based on the underlying technologies. We do not claim to have expertise in the various intellectual properties we seek to acquire. Instead, our value was based on our ability to assess technologies and appropriate partners for the commercialization of products and process based on the underlying intellectual property. Research and development of the underly technologies was being performed at major universities in Florida. The development of a commercial products was conducted by our strategic partners.



Our Plan



Going forward, we intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for our shareholders. Our objectives discussed below are extremely general and are not intended to restrict discretion of our board of directors to search for and enter into potential business opportunities or to reject any such opportunities.



We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. Further, we may acquire or combine with a venture that is in its preliminary or early stages of development, one that is already in operation or one that is in a more mature stage of its corporate existence. Accordingly, business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex.
