ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a biotechnology company developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat diseases across,  several therapeutics areas, including, lysosomal storage disorders (“LSDs”), central nervous system disorders (“CNS”), metabolic disorders, and oncology. We use our exclusively in-licensed computational target and drug discover platform, Site-Directed Enzyme Enhancement Therapy (“SEE-Tx®”), to discover novel allosteric binding sites on proteins implicated in a disease and to identify proprietary small molecules that bind these sites to modulate protein function, and treat the underlying cause of the disease. These binding sites, distinct from the protein’s active site, are called allosteric sites. We believe that targeting an allosteric binding site instead of the active binding site of a protein provides numerous advantages: the ability to regulate proteins implicated in disease through several different mechanisms of action covering both functional and conformational effects, including stabilization, destabilization, targeted degradation, allosteric inhibition, and allosteric activation of the targeted protein; improved specificity of small molecules because binding to an allosteric binding site is non-competitive with the natural substrate that binds to the active binding site; and the ability to identify small molecules with more favorable drug-like properties. The SEE-Tx® platform has been used to identify novel allosteric sites and small molecules for all of our internal and partnered programs.  Discovering and targeting novel allosteric sites with our platform not only collapses traditional drug discovery timelines but enables rational drug design and offers the potential for superior small molecule drugs that are highly specific and that can penetrate hard to reach tissues and cross the blood-brain barrier.
We have filed four patent applications for our novel small molecule drug candidates that are Structurally Targeted Allosteric Regulators (“STARs”). In June 2021, the Company announced the publication of two PCT patents. The first was directed at compounds targeting misfolded beta-​glucocerebrosidase (GBA) addressing CNS diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Gaucher disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Lewy body dementia. The second was directed at compounds targeting galactosylceramidase (GALC), addressing demyelinating disorders such as Krabbe disease and multiple sclerosis. 
We have identified two different STARs as the lead compounds for our Parkinson’s disease program and our Gaucher disease program and are currently developing these product candidates through preclinical studies. In September 2021, the Company announced positive topline data of an in vitro study evaluating the two STARs for the treatment of Gaucher and Parkinson’s disease in neuronal cells derived induced pluripotent stem cells (“iPSCs”) of a a patient with Gaucher disease that contained the disease-causing mutation of the GBA1 gene and from iPSCs of a healthy donor with a normal GBA1 gene, so called wild-type cells. The results of the study, conducted at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, demonstrate a significant increase in beta-glucocerebrosidase (“GCase”) protein levels, improved trafficking of GCase to the lysosome, and a significant decrease of toxic substrates glucosylceramide and alpha-synuclein p129 levels in both the neuronal cells that contained the mutated GBA1 gene as well as the wild-type cells. Alpha synuclein is consididered to be the hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. In addition, these data provides further evidence that these product candidates have the potential to treat Gaucher disease and Parkinson’s disease and slow or stop the progression of GBA Parkinson’s disease.
We expect to complete the preclinical development and submit the regulatory dossier to the Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial in our Parkinson’s disease program, and to initiate the preclinical toxicology studies for our Gaucher program in the second half of 2022. In addition, we plan to continue to advance research programs and initiate additional programs targeting allosteric binding sites identified with the SEE-Tx® platform.  Through academic partnerships, co-development and licensing arrangements, we intend to develop a broad pipeline of therapeutics, using our novel approach of identifying and targeting previously unknown allosteric sites.  
Since our inception in 2017, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to identify and develop next-generation brain-penetrant allosteric small molecules for the treatment of devastating diseases with high-unmet medical needs using our in-licensed SEE-Tx® platform. To date, we do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have primarily financed our operations through a combination of sales of our securities and research grants. On March 17, 2021, we completed our IPO and issued and sold approximately 4.1 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share, including approximately 0.5 million shares in connection with the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional 

5



shares, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $40.5 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
Our operations have consisted primarily of organizing and expanding the Company’s operation, securing financing, performing research, conducting preclinical studies and developing licensed technology. We face risks associated with early-stage biotechnology companies whose product candidates are in development. Product candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital for us to complete our research and development, achieve our research and development objectives, defend our intellectual property rights, and recruit and retain skilled personnel, and key members of management. Even if our product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, we will realize significant revenue from product sales.
Our Platform for Computational Target and Drug Discovery
Overview
A majority of disease-causing proteins (up to 90%) cannot be targeted due to the lack of a known binding site. Our exclusively in-licensed platform, SEE-Tx® was designed to address this problem. We use the platform to discover novel binding sites on proteins implicated in a disease and to identify proprietary small molecules that bind these sites to modulate protein function and treat the underlying cause of the disease. We focus specifically on allosteric binding sites distinct from the protein’s active, or orthosteric, binding site, where a small molecule can attach and trigger an effect that may lead to a therapeutic benefit. We refer to the small molecules we identify that bind to these allosteric sites as structurally targeted allosteric regulators, or STARs, to reflect their mechanism of action and how they are discovered.  The graphic below provided an overview of SEE-Tx®.

​
Allosteric Buinding Site Identification
Using the three-dimensional structure of proteins that have been experimentally derived or generated or that predictive protein structures from the Alphafold database and our computational technology, our SEE-Tx® platform applies various computational methods and proprietary algorithms to identify and map previously uncharacterized binding sites on the proteins called “binding hotspots or allosteric binding sites.” These are key points on the protein surface where a small molecule can potentially bind. The amount, density, nature and quality of these hotspots determine the druggability of the protein, that is, if a drug-like small molecules can effectively bind to the particular site with an appropriate potency.
Advantages of Targeting Allosteric Binding Sites 
 We focus on allosteric binding site, which offer a number of advantages compared to targeting the active binding site of a protein, including the ability to regulate proteins implicated in disease through several different mechanisms of action covering both functional and conformational effects, improved specificity of small molecules because binding to an allosteric binding site is non-competitive with the natural substrate that binds to the active binding site, 

6



and the ability to identify small molecules with more favorable drug-like properties.  The graphic below provided an overview of the differences and benefits of allosteric binding sites compared to active binding sites.
​
​
​
Identification of Structurally Targeted Allosteric Regulatotrs (“STARs”) – Our Molecular Hypothesis 
After an allosteric site has been identified, characterized and selected for targeting, we then use our proprietary structure-based virtual screening methodology to filter a pool of seven to ten million commercially-available compounds to identify those that may potentially bind to the hotspot and have a functional effect. Using this information, we develop structural templates to guide the development of a narrowed pool of unique and proprietary small molecules that bind to the newly discovered allosteric sites.
We believe our process for identifying STARs is a more efficient and effective drug discovery tool than traditional drug discovery approaches such as random high-throughput screening because we use a validated-target approach. In high-throughput screening, very large libraries of randomly selected molecules are tested for their ability to perform a specific function such as binding to a target protein. This approach typically results in a large number of positive responses that must then be laboriously analyzed to identify compounds with relevant properties and effect. In contrast, every small molecule hit identified by our platform is experimentally tested based on a two-part molecular hypothesis to confirm that (1) the compound has a positive effect on the relevant biomarkers implicated in the disease and (2) binding to the allosteric binding site identified with the SEE-Tx® platform has the intended effect on protein function. Compared to high throughput screening, our validated-target approach is significantly less expensive, significantly faster and significantly more effective. We run our SEE-Tx® simulations for target and drug discovery in supercomputer centers where we pay only for time used as and when needed. We can identify a novel allosteric site in one to two weeks, perform virtual screening in three to four weeks, and validate compounds experimentally in two to three weeks. Our average hit rate for validated compounds is 14%, which represents a greater than 1000-fold enrichment compared to traditional high throughput screening methods. In addition, traditional screening methods takes months to years to complete.
Allosteric Regulators Cover Several Mechanisms of Action 
Another benefit of targeting allosteric sites, is that it allows for several different mechanisms of action. In our LSD and Parkinson’s disease programs, we have identified STARs that are designed to bind to a misfolded protein, stabilize that protein and restore protein function. However, in areas such as oncology, we have identified STARs that are designed to destabilize normal proteins by binding to a non-native or mutant form of the protein and  render  it inactive. There are several additional potential mechanisms of action including allosteric targeted protein degradation, as well as traditional allosteric inhibition or activation by inducing a conformational change to inhibit or induce binding 

7



by the natural ligand of the active site of the protein.  The graphic below provides an overview of the different mechanism of action available through allosteric binding sites.

​
Enzyme Misfolding and Disease 
Proteins are large biomolecules that have a vast array of functions in different cell types in the body. Enzymes are a type of protein that accelerate and facilitate chemical reactions inside of cells by acting on substrates and converting those substrates into different chemical products. To perform their function in the body, enzymes and other proteins must be folded into the correct three-dimensional shape. Misfolded enzymes may not function properly, which can lead to the toxic accumulation of unprocessed substrate which is the cause of many rare genetic diseases, including LSDs and some neurodegenerative diseases such as certain forms of Parkinson’s disease. Enzyme misfolding may arise from genetic mutations that disrupt the folding pattern as well as from cellular stress due to aging and inflammation. Therapeutic small molecules that facilitate the folding of enzymes into their correct shape can restore function and the proper processing of substrate. As illustrated below, in LSDs, the gene that codes for an enzyme is mutated and results in a misfolded enzyme. The misfolded enzyme cannot traffic through the cell resulting in toxic protein accumulation. We believe that our STARs will have the ability to bind to the allosteric site of the defective enzyme and restore wild type activity and thus serve as potential therapeutic treatments for diseases. The graphic below provided an overview of the postulated mechanism of action.
​
​
Limitations of Current Therapies for the Treatment of LSDs 
Current therapeutic approaches to address misfolded enzymes have inherent limitations. In standard chaperone therapy, the drug binds to the active site of the enzyme or other target protein which impairs the protein’s function to some degree by competing with the active substrate, decreasing efficacy and potentially leading to 

8



selectivity issues. Other treatments such as enzyme replacement therapy (“ERT”), in which new functional enzymes are infused into the patient, are not optimal for treating neurological conditions because currently available ERTs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and do not address the root cause of the disease. Gene therapy, which aims to create new, functional enzymes, is not readily accepted for treating neurological conditions because the procedure is invasive in nature and the efficacy of treating neurological conditions remains to be established. Given these limitations on current therapies, we believe patients would benefit from a new therapeutic approach both on its own and, potentially, in combination with existing therapies. We believe our therapeutic approach represents a potentially significant change from current approaches by addressing protein misfolding using our efficient and proprietary ability to identify previously undiscovered allosteric sites and compounds that avoid the active sites of enzymes and cross the blood-brain barrier or penetrate other hard-to-treat tissues such as bone and cartilage. Additionally, our approach enables the less-invasive and more convenience of oral administration.
Our Pipeline of STARs
We are leveraging our SEE-Tx® technology platform to develop a pipeline of novel small molecule drug candidates to address complex diseases. The initial focus of the development pipeline was on several LSDs with high unmet medical need, but has since expanded to include CNS disorders, metabolic diseases, and oncology. The platform is disease agnostic and provides us with the ability to expand our pipeline as we continue to discover new targets. We have entered into a number of collaborations to advance the development of our programs, such as with the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, The Silverstein Foundation, University of Illinois, Chicago and the University of Maryland; these collaborations are understandings to work together in the research of potential therapies for the treatment of specific diseases. Neither we, nor the institutions we collaborate with, are under contractual obligations to continue the collaboration and all parties retain their respective intellectual property. Additionally, we have a multi-target drug development and commercialization partnership with Zentalis Pharmaceuticals for the development of novel small molecules for the treatment of cancers.  
We believe that the STARs we have selected for our product pipeline programs have high specificity to their allosteric binding site and do not interact with the active site of the enzyme target, which is designed to enhance both tolerability and response. Our technology allows us to identify STARs that have the ability to bind to both mutant and wild-type enzymes. Because they are small molecules, STARs can be administered orally, have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter hard-to-treat tissues such as bone and cartilage. We believe the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier is essential to effectively treating diseases with neurological symptoms. In addition, we believe our STARs could be used in combination with ERT or gene therapy approaches to more completely address the patient’s needs.

GCase Enzyme-Related Disorders: GBA1 Parkinson’s Disease and Neuronopathic Gaucher Disease
We are investigating the restoration of GCase enzymatic function as a treatment for Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD), an LSD. GCase is an enzyme encoded by the GBA1 gene and found in lysosomes that is needed to breakdown the large molecule glucocerebroside (a component of the cell membrane) into sugar and fat. 
Homozygous mutations of the GBA1 gene lead to the misfolding of GCase and associated degradation, which in turn can lead to accumulation of these substrates to toxic levels in the liver, spleen, bone marrow and nervous system and can result in lysosomal storage and neurodegenerative diseases. Unlike other types of Gaucher disease, none of the existing therapeutics are effective in treating nGD. 
The GBA1 gene mutation most commonly associated with nGD is also found in the most pathogenic form of Parkinson’s disease (PD), where heterozygous mutations of the GBA1 gene also lead to the misfolding of GCase and reduced GCase activity, which similarly leads to accumulation of the toxic substrate alpha-synuclein, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. Decreased GCasse activity is also observed in idiopathic PD (PD that occurs in patients without GBA1 mutuations) and Lewy Body Dementia. Currently, there is no cure for nGD or PD, and there are very limited treatment options. Current treatments such as ERT cannot address central nervous system symptoms because they cannot cross the blood-brain barrier.
Overview of GBA1 Parkinson’s Disease 
Parkinson’s disease is a disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement, often including tremors. Nerve cell damage in the brain causes dopamine levels to drop, leading to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease often starts with a tremor in one hand and other symptoms including slow movement, stiffness and loss of balance, and progresses to a severe debilitating disease that eventually require full-time home care or a transfer to a skilled nursing facility. 
GBA1 Parkinson’s disease is caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene, which are among the most pathogenic risk factors for the development of Parkinson’s disease and related neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in cell bodies of neurons. It is widely accepted that GCase deficiency has a biological role as a modifier or facilitator of Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis in the brain. Brain autopsy studies have shown that even some cases of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (without GBA1 mutations) exhibit decreased levels of GCase. Reduced GCase activity may enhance the risk for Parkinson’s disease by facilitating a pathological hallmark, namely alpha-synuclein accumulation. Alpha-synuclein accumulation and GCase deficiency are thought to act in a debilitating cycle. GCase deficiency can cause the accumulation of glucosylsphingosine substrate, which has been reported to directly affect the accumulation and aggregation of alpha-synuclein. In addition, increased alpha-synuclein levels can lead to less GCase activity, which in turn can lead to more alpha-synuclein accumulation. 
Parkinson’s disease is reported to affect about 1 in 780 people worldwide or approximately one million worldwide. Up to 14% of patients with Parkinson’s disease carry GBA1 mutations, making it the major genetic risk factor for the disease and this rate is higher in certain patient populations. At present, there is no effective cure for Parkinson’s disease. Treatment options or potential treatments, such as ERT, are limited due to their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier and are therefore unable to prevent neurodegeneration. Current approved therapies for Parkinson’s disease are limited to symptomatic treatments such as levodopa, dopaminergic receptor agonists and inhibitors of enzymes related to dopamine metabolism such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors. These therapies aim to improve overall dopaminergic function. The benefits of these types of treatments diminish over time as the disease progresses, and these therapies do not impact the non-motor symptoms or the progression of the disease. As the disease progresses, the non-motor symptoms, such as dementia and cognitive impairment, can lead to severe morbidity and mortality. 
Preclinical Characterization of Lead Compound GT-02287 for the Treatment of PD 
 Biological Activity 
We have identified the lead compound GT-02287 targeting GCase for the treatment of GBA1 and idiopathic PD. Biophysical assay results have demonstrated that our STAR compound can bind to GCase protein and increase its thermal stability. We observed a dose-dependent increase in GCase activity in normal and GCase mutant cells when 

10



treated with our STAR molecule. Additionally, GT-02287 has shown cell type and mutation specific GCase enzyme enhancement in an extended panel of patient derived cells representative of the most frequent and pathogenic GBA1 mutations related to GBA1 Parkinson’s and neuronopathic Gaucher’s disease. 
To assess GCase delivery into the lysosomes upon treatment with GT-02287, HEK293 were transfected with either GBA WT, GBA L444P and GBA N370S with HaloTag, thirty hours later, compounds and a fluorescent Halo ligand that covalently binds to a pocket in the tag were added for 17 hours. Once the protein reaches the lysosome, the tag is cleaved off GCase but is resistant to lysosomal hydrolases enabling the detection of a 31 kDa fluorescent fragment that corresponds to the protein that reached the lysosome. Full length protein and lysosomal fragment were measured by western blot. Treatment with GT-02287 of transfected cells both with WT and mutated GBA1 (N370S, L444P) leads to enhanced GCase lysosomal delivery. 
The efficacy of GT-02287 was assessed in an in vitro model of rat primary mesencephalic neurons where GD was chemically induced by inhibiting GCase using the irreversible inhibitor CBE. Cells were cultured, at day 6, GT-02287 was applied and after 24 hours, CBE (400 µM) was added to the culture medium for 48 hours. On day 8, the culture was fixed and stained with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker for dopaminergic neurons. Neuronal survival, neurite network was evaluated. GT-02287 was assessed at 100 nM, 500 nM, 1 µM and 12.5 µM and dose-dependently improved neuronal survival, neurite network and decreased CBE-induced a-synuclein accumulation in TH neurons.
We used an in vitro model based on patient-derived iPSCs differentiated into cortical neurons to assess the efficacy of GT-02287 in enhancing GCase enzyme activity, protein levels, translocation into the lysosomes, as well as the ability of GT-02287 in reducing toxic substates (GlcCer and a-synuclein). 45-day cortical human neurons were incubated with GT-02287 for 48 hrs. The cell pellets were washed once with 1xPBS and stored at -80°C. Sphingolipids were extracted from pelleted cells and analyzed by LC-MS and data was collected form three independent experiments.
We reported that GT-02287 increased GCase enzyme levels, co-localization of GCase with lysosomes, reduced both phosphorylated and aggregated a-synuclein as well as reduced GlcCer accumulation in L444P/RecNcil and L444P/L444P patients (see figure below).
​

Toxicology and Safety 
GT-02287 was administered in mice with IV (3 mice per dose group) and oral administration (12 mice per dose group). GT-02287 was safe up to 60 mg/kg IV and was well tolerated up to 120mg/kg PO BID following sub-chronic twelve days treatment. Additional non-clinical studies, which include toxicology, safety and pharmacology studies are currently ongoing for GT-02287.
Pharmacokinetics 
We examined promising STAR molecules in neuro-PK studies to evaluate their brain penetration properties. GT-02287 showed high brain exposure with a brain-to-plasma ratio level greater than one. Additional PK studies will be performed as part of the regulatory non-clinical study package.

11



Pharmacology 
A preclinical rotenone-induced Parkinson’s disease model in rats demonstrated that oral administration of GT-02287 leads to a dose-dependent depletion of total and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein, increase in tyrosine hydroxylase, reduction of microgliosis as well as improvement in rearing behavior. GT-02287 was administered orally, twice a day for 7 days, to ten rats per group and samples were collected one day after final administration. Rearing behavior and locomotion assessment has been performed at day 8.

Overview of GBA Gaucher Disease
Gaucher disease is an inherited LSD caused by homozygous mutations of the GBA1 gene that result in the misfolding and subsequent dysfunction of beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), an enzyme that breaks down fatty chemicals in the body. Gaucher disease is traditionally classified according to one of three types. Type 1 Gaucher disease is traditionally referred to as a non-neuronopathic form of the disease, for which some treatments are available, but evolving science has shown that patients with type 1 Gaucher disease may also manifest neurological symptoms later in life. Current ERT and gene therapy treatments are unable to address the onset of type 1 neurological symptoms because these treatments are unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. Unlike Gaucher disease type 1, Gaucher disease types 2 and 3 have early onset brain degeneration that gets progressively worse over time. For this reason, Gaucher disease types 2 and 3 are known as neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD). Currently, there is no effective treatment for the severe brain degeneration associated with Gaucher disease types 2 and 3. In type 2 Gaucher disease, there is neurological impairment that presents before birth through the first months of life, progresses rapidly, and is typically fatal within two years. It is a devastating disorder characterized by neurodegeneration and brainstem dysfunction. Additionally, infants with Gaucher disease may have abnormally large organs, deficiency in growth, seizures and compromised swallow and airway problems. Gaucher disease type 3 (also known as chronic neuronopathic Gaucher disease) is thought to be the most common type worldwide. It has a 

12



later and more gradual onset compared with type 2. People with Gaucher disease type 3 may survive into adulthood with a wide variety of signs and symptoms, including seizures, skeletal irregularities, eye movement disorders, cognitive and coordination problems as well as enlarged liver and spleen, respiratory problems and blood disorders. 
Gaucher disease is caused by alterations in the GBA1 gene that encodes GCase, an enzyme which catalyzes a key step in breaking down glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. Partial or complete loss of GCase activity can cause the buildup of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine in the lysosomes of macrophages and the accumulation of these lipid substrates within the CNS can result in neurological symptoms. 
The prevalence of Gaucher disease type 1 (non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease) is reported as 1:57,000 to 75,000 people worldwide. Type 1 is the most common form in Western countries (around 95%). The prevalence of type 2 and type 3 Gaucher disease (so called neuronopathic Gaucher disease, or nGD) is approximately 1:100,000 people worldwide, and these forms are the most common in non-Western countries, especially in Asian countries where they make up more than 50% of the Gaucher disease patient population. At present there are no available treatment options for neuronopathic Gaucher disease, but ERT is still used to address organ enlargement, hematological manifestation and bone disease, as well as to improve the quality of life for these patients. ERT does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is not efficient in treating neurological manifestations, therefore creating a significant unmet medical need in this patient population.
Preclinical Characterization of GT-02329 for the Treatment of Gaucher Disease
We have identified the lead compound GT-02329 targeting GCase for nGD. Biophysical assay results have demonstrated that our STAR compound can bind to GCase protein and increase its thermal stability. We observed a dose-dependent increase in GCase activity in normal and GCase mutant cells when treated with our STAR molecule. The efficacy of GT-02329 in depleting GlcSph (Lyso-Gb1) was assessed in dopaminergic neurons BE(2)-M17 carrying either wild-type or L444P GBA1 mutation after treatment for 10 days with 25 μM of compound. As shown in the figures below, treatment with GT-02329 of cells bearing wild-type and L444P GCase leads to a decrease of glucosylsphingosine. Media exchange with compound was performed after 3 days, then after 4 days and finally cells were harvested after 3 additional days. GlcSph (Lyso-Gb1) levels were quantified by LC-MS. 
STAR compounds decrease glucosylsphingosine levels in the neuronal cell model
Supported by a grant from the Michael J. Fox Foundation and the Silverstein Foundation, the promising compounds were further evaluated in a neuronal cell model developed by the Vall d’Hebron Research Institute. These neuronal cell lines express either normal or mutated GCase and display alpha-synuclein accumulation. Since accumulation of alpha-synuclein is the pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease, the use of these cell lines is important to determine the capacity of STAR compounds to decrease accumulation of the most pathogenic form of alpha-synuclein, namely phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (p-synuclein) through enhancement of GCase activity.
In a study with patient-derived iPSCs, 45-day cortical human neurons were incubated with GT-02329 for 48 hrs. The cell pellets were washed once with 1xPBS and stored at -80°C. Sphingolipids were extracted from pelleted cells and analyzed by LC-MS and data was collected form three independent experiments. In this study, GT-02329 was shown to enhance GCase levels and co-localization with lysosomes, and to decrease phosphorylated a-synuclein.

13



Pharmacokinetics
We examined STAR molecules in neuro-PK studies to evaluate their brain penetration properties. GT-02329 showed high brain exposure with a brain-to-plasma ratio level greater than one. Additional PK studies will be performed as part of the regulatory non-clinical study package.
Pharmacology
A preclinical mouse model demonstrated that oral administration of GT-02329 significantly enhances WT GCase activity both in striatum and plasma and the effect is dose-dependent. GT-02329 was administered orally, twice a day for 12 days, to ten mice per group and samples were collected one hour after the final administration.

Pipeline Programs in Research Phase
In addition to our preclinical stage programs for PD and nGD, we have a range of programs in LSDs and a program in a metabolic disease that are in various stages of research. 
GLB Enzyme-Related Disorders: GM1 Gangliosidosis
GLB is an enzyme found in lysosomes, which are compartments within cells that degrade and recycle different types of molecules, including toxic molecules. GLB is essential for the breakdown of GM1 and keratan sulfate, which serve important functions in the brain and other tissues. Misfolding of GLB allows these substrates to build up to toxic levels and leads to the diseases GM1 Gangliosidosis.  
GM1 gangliosidosis is a rare and often life-threatening LSD in infants (type 1), juveniles (type 2) and adults (type 3). It manifests in a continuum of clinical severity by type. In type 1 or the infantile form, the onset is observed earlier and is a more severe and rapidly progressive disease. Type 2 and 3 are less severe manifestations and have slower progression with a juvenile or adult onset. The infantile form of the disease is characterized by onset in the first year of life with symptoms including hypotonia (reduced muscle tone), progressive CNS dysfunction that can lead to deafness, blindness, enlarged liver and spleen rigidity, and progressive skeletal dysplasia that can result in restrictive lung disease and aspiration pneumonia. The disease rapidly progresses, with a life expectancy of two to four years. Juvenile GM1 manifests between 18 months and five years of age with a slower progression compared to infants. The average life expectancy for type 2 GM1 is typically 10 years. Adult GM1 has an onset age between three and 30. While it is less severe and progresses at a slower rate than infantile or juvenile GM1, adult GM1 causes debilitating symptoms, including muscular atrophy, corneal clouding and dystonia. 
The prevalence of GM1 is approximately 1:100,000 to 200,000 live births worldwide. Currently, there is no effective cure for GM1, and symptomatic treatment options, including substrate reduction therapy, ERT, bone marrow transplantation, stem cell transplantation and gene therapy are limited or still under development. Existing approaches are unable to address both the neuronal and systemic symptoms because current treatment options cannot cross the blood-brain barrier or reach other hard-to-treat organs such as bone.

In Vitro and In Vivo Characterization of STARs for the Treatment of GM1 Gangliosidosis
We have identified novel STAR molecules targeting GLB through our SEE-Tx® platform and conducted our initial studies on these compounds. Binding of two of these compounds to the GLB target has been confirmed using a biophysical assay. Preclinical studies indicate that our STARs help mutated GLB escape premature degradation and travel to the lysosome where it can perform its catalytic activity. These preliminary studies were conducted in vitro using cells that carried the GLB1 mutation.  In addition, one compound showed clearance of the toxic GM1 ganglioside accumulation in GM1-affected canine cells.   
We also tested the GLB-targeting compounds in an acute toxicity study in mice after oral administration. No abnormal clinical signs were observed and there were no mortalities at the tested dose levels. As such, we have not yet established a maximum tolerable dose in mice.  Further, we performed preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with the GLB-targeting compounds in mice confirming that the compounds showed positive brain-penetrating properties. In oral bioavailability studies in mice, we found no central or peripheral clinical abnormalities, and the brain to plasma ratio was greater than one at each dose tested while the bone to plasma ratio increased approximately 3-fold over time from one hour to eight hours. The pharmacokinetic profile was completed with PK studies of one compound after repeated treatments to obtain safety information and exposure in tissues including brain and bone, showing that it was generally well-tolerated after seven days of treatment without showing clinical signs. Comparable plasma exposure was observed at oral doses at two dose levels, and accumulation was not observed after seven days of treatment. Brain concentrations were quantifiable up to eight hours following the last dose showing brain and bone exposure.  
After conducting initial pharmacological studies in 2021, we are currently testing additional compounds in in vitro assays to provide the basis for a decision on the lead series selection. 
IDUA Enzyme-Related Disorders: Mucopolysaccharidosis Type 1 (MPS1)
IDUA is an enzyme in lysosomes needed to breakdown large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), especially heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. The misfolding of IDUA can allow substrate to build up to toxic levels in the bone and cartilage and can result in MPS1. There is no cure for MPS1, and treatment options to address symptoms such as enzyme replacement therapy or ERT, laronidase®, and bone marrow transplants are limited.
We have identified a STAR targeting IDUA and are applying medicinal chemistry approaches to generate proprietary compounds. Preclinical studies of this compound have shown that in healthy cells, this STAR can stabilize recombinant IDUA and increase its activity. Additionally, when this STAR is co-administrated with laronidase, there is a dose-dependent increase in IDUA activity levels in vitro and in mice.
Overview of MPS1
MPS1 is a rare LSD that presents as a spectrum of symptoms that can include severe impairment of the CNS. Because there is no clear delineation between the syndromes, patients are best described as having one of two subtypes, severe MPS1 or attenuated MPS1. Patients with severe MPS1 typically have earlier onset of symptoms and experience a decline in intellectual function and a more rapid disease progression.
Symptoms include abnormal formation of the soft tissue of the face, enlarged vocal cords, enlarged liver and spleen, heart valve defects, short stature, joint deformities, corneal clouding, macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, hearing loss, development delays and regression. Children with severe MPS1 usually do not live past the age of 10. Patients with attenuated MPS1 make up approximately 55% of all MPS1 cases and present a variety of symptoms that tend to be less acute than in those seen in severe MPS1. Due to their longer life span, attenuated MPS1 patients also make up a larger fraction of the patient population.
MPS1 results from mutations in the gene encoding IDUA, an enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in terminal α-L-iduronic acid residues of complex glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Impaired degradation of these molecules can lead to their accumulation within lysosomes and triggers a complex cascade of intracellular events ultimately leading to multisystem morbidity caused by tissue damage and organ dysfunction.

15



The prevalence of severe MPS1 is reported as affecting about 1 in 100,000 live births. Attenuated MPS1 is less common and occurs in about 1 in 500,000 live births. At present, there is no effective cure for MPS1 and there are limited treatment options to address symptoms such as enzyme replace therapy or ERT, laronidase, and bone marrow transplants. These approaches, however, do not cross the blood-brain barrier or penetrate the hard to treat tissues like cartilage.
Preclinical Characterization of IDUA Compounds
Biological Activity
We have identified certain compounds that bind to an allosteric site on IDUA with functional effect. We plan to use this compound as a starting point to generate proprietary compounds. These compounds have been shown to stabilize IDUA and protect the enzyme against denaturation in physiological conditions. Preclinical cell-based studies indicate that stability and cellular uptake of IDUA is enhanced when co-administered with these compounds in MPS-affected fibroblasts.
Toxicology and Safety
The acute toxicity of these preliminary test compounds was investigated after acute intravenous administration to mice to provide information on the maximum tolerated dose to be used in pharmacology studies and determined the maximum tolerable dose for intravenous administration in mice.
Pharmacokinetics
We performed a neuro-PK study in mice after intravenous administration and determined the compound was not detected in the brain. However, these compounds showed tissue distribution in bone and cartilage, the relevant tissues for MPS1, after oral administration in mice, which is critical for a potential treatment of MPS1 as current treatments are ineffective at penetrating bone and cartilage. Additionally, at higher doses limited brain penetration was observed and the low brain penetration of this compound was confirmed from a pharmacology study performed.
Pharmacology
Combination therapy of STARs with pharmacological chaperones and ERT can improve tissue uptake and reduce ERT’s immunogenicity by stabilizing the enzyme in its properly folded and active form in vivo. In preclinical studies, one of our STAR compounds was co-administered with laronidase (Aldurazyme®), an approved enzyme replacement therapy, intravenously to mice. Data show the combination treatment stabilized the recombinant enzyme, increasing enzymatic activity levels in plasma, liver, bone and cartilage in a dose-dependent manner. Bone and cartilage represent the most critical medical need due to poor ERT uptake in these tissues. The benefit of combination therapy is particularly noticeable at longer times.
GALC Enzyme-Related Disorders: Krabbe Disease
We are investigating the restoration of GALC function as a treatment for Krabbe disease. GALC is an enzyme in lysosomes needed to breakdown galactolipids, which are fats primarily found in the nervous system and kidneys. Among the galactolipids that GALC breaks down are galactosylceramide, which is an essential component of neuronal myelin, and psychosine, which is formed during myelin production and is toxic to cells. The misfolding of GALC can result in the toxic accumulation of galactosylceramide, inhibiting myelin production, and of psychosine, leading to demyelination of cells and ultimately to Krabbe disease. There is no available cure for Krabbe disease. Current developments in invasive procedures such as bone marrow transplants have not been shown to provide significant neurological improvements, and most developments in gene therapy treatments are still in the preclinical stages.
We have identified compounds that bind to allosteric sites on GALC and stabilize the enzyme in vitro. We are continuing our development of these promising molecules.
Overview of Krabbe Disease
Krabbe disease is a severe neurological condition that is part of a group of disorders which result from the loss of myelin (demyelination) in the CNS. Myelin is the protective covering around neurons that ensures the rapid 

16



transmission of neural signals. The most common form of Krabbe disease, the infantile form, usually begins before the age of one. Initial symptoms typically include irritability, muscle weakness, feeding difficulties, episodes of fever without any sign of infection, stiff posture and delayed mental and physical development. As the disease progresses, muscles continue to weaken, affecting the infant’s ability to move, chew, swallow and breathe. Affected infants also experience vision loss and seizures. Because of the severity of the condition, individuals with the infantile form of Krabbe disease rarely survive beyond the age of two. The less common forms, those that have a later onset, begin in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. Vision problems and walking difficulties are the most common initial symptoms in these late-onset forms of the disorder, however, signs and symptoms vary considerably among affected individuals. Individuals with late-onset Krabbe disease may survive many years after the condition begins.
Krabbe disease is an inherited LSD caused by mutations in the gene GALC. In affected individuals, GALC substrate psychosine accumulation can trigger a neuroinflammatory response, a loss of myelin forming cells and a progressive demyelination of the central and peripheral nervous systems.
The prevalence of Krabbe disease is reported as about 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 250,000 live births worldwide. At present, there is no effective cure or disease-modifying treatment for Krabbe Disease. Treatment of a child who is symptomatic before six months of age is supportive and focused on improving quality of life and avoiding complications. For older individuals, treatment with HSCT is individualized based on disease burden and manifestations, but it serves to delay disease progression and is not an effective cure.
Preclinical Characterization of GALC STAR Lead Compounds
Biological Activity
We have identified several compounds that bind to allosteric sites on GALC and are able to stabilize GALC against thermal denaturation. STAR molecules were tested in vitro in transfected HEK293 cells bearing different mutations (WT, G286D, T529M). We examined promising STAR molecules in neuro-PK studies to evaluate their brain penetration properties. Several of the compounds selected showed enhanced enzyme enhancement and high brain exposure with a brain-to-plasma ratio level greater than one.
In collaboration with Ernesto R. Bongarzone, Ph.D., Professor in Neuroscience at the College of Medicine at the University of Illinois, Chicago, initial compounds from this program were tested in mouse glial cultures and cell lines with relevant GALC mutations to measure their effect on GALC enzymatic activity and psychosine levels. We showed that the tested compounds showed significant reduction in psychosine levels in glial cultures.
ARSA Enzyme-related Disorders: Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD)
We are investigating the restoration of ARSA function as a treatment for Metachromatic Leukodystrophy. ARSA is an enzyme in lysosomes needed to breakdown sulfatides and sulfate-containing lipids, which are critical constituents in the nervous system comprising approximately 5% of the myelin lipids. The misfolding of ARSA can result in the toxic accumulation of sulfatide in the nervous system, which eventually leads to myelin breakdown (leukodystrophy) and a progressive neurologic disorder. 
We have identified two potential allosteric sites and have selected 133 virtual hits obtained from virtual screening with whom to start experimental hit confirmation. 
Overview of MLD
Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal recessive hereditary neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the ARSA gene, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A. At least 280 ARSA pathogenic variants have been reported, mostly missense mutations. Impaired breakdown of sulfatides and sulfate-containing lipids due to ARSA deficiency in the nervous system eventually leads to myelin breakdown (leukodystrophy) and a progressive neurologic disorder. The exact molecular pathogenic processes of demyelination in MLD are poorly understood. 

17



The clinical presentation of MLD is heterogeneous with respect to the age of onset, the rate of progression, and the initial symptoms. The clinical manifestations and a degree of neurodegeneration depend on the type of mutation and the level of enzyme deficiency. Three clinical subtypes of MLD are primarily distinguished by age of onset: 
●Late-infantile MLD, comprising 50%-60% of affected individuals
●Juvenile MLD, approximately 20%-30%
●Adult MLD, approximately 15%-20%
Although the presenting symptoms and age of onset vary, all individuals eventually develop complete loss of motor, sensory, and intellectual functions. The disease course may be from several years in the late-infantile-onset form to decades in the juvenile- and adult-onset forms. Death most commonly results from pneumonia or other infection. Life span correlates roughly with the age of onset but can be quite variable, particularly in the later-onset forms. 
Current management is still mostly symptomatic and/or relies on HSCT; however, Libmeldy® (ex vivo gene therapy) has been the first disease-modifying treatment to be approved to date (Dec 2020 in the EU, Ph III in US) and is administered to patients with:
●late infantile or early juvenile forms of the disease who have not yet developed symptoms;
●early juvenile forms who have initial symptoms but can still walk independently and have not yet developed mental deterioration.
There are still limitations and unmet medical needs connected to ex vivo gene therapy. First, it cannot be administered to patients with manifested clinical symptoms therefore it is not ideal for late-onset forms. Moreover, it is very expensive and must be performed in specialized centers since autologous HSCs are transduced ex vivo with ARSA-encoding lentiviral vector and reinfused after the patients had been treated with a myeloablative regimen. Moreover, there is no data yet available on how effective this cross-correction is in the long-term (>15 y). 
The overall prevalence has been reported at between 1:40,000 and 1:160,000 worldwide. The disorder is pan ethnic; however, most data come from European and North American populations, where prevalence ranges from 1:40,000 to 1:100,000. Incidence is estimated to be 1:40,000 births in the United States of America. Males and females are affected equally and there is no difference in survival. 
Primary Screening
Hit identification was completed with two orthogonal techniques: hit confirmation was obtained for 8 of 35 compounds (23% hit rate) with consistent Kd-range in the two-digit μM. Hit analoging was completed with 82 analog compounds tested in dose-response assay. A positive signal was obtained for 22 of 82 compounds (27% hit rate) with consistent Kd-range in the two-digit µM.
Rare Metabolic Liver/Lung Disorder
We are investigating the stabilization of an undisclosed enzyme to avoid its gain of function in the liver and provide a treatment for a rare lung/liver disease. We have identified one allosteric site and have selected 146 virtual hits obtained from virtual screening with whom to start experimental hit confirmation. 
Primary Screening
Hit identification completed with Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) at one concentration and in dose-response. Binding was confirmed for 23 of 146 compounds (15.6% hit rate). Hit analoging was completed with 85 analog compounds tested in a SPR dose-response assay. Positive signal was observed for 4 of 85 compounds.

Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the rare disease field, are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property.  
We are not aware of any other companies that are taking the therapeutic approach to protein folding disorders similar to the one we are pursuing. However, we are aware of companies developing gene therapy approaches for our target indications. For example, Axovant Gene Therapies, Ltd., recently began clinical trial for its gene therapy treatment for juvenile GM1, and Lysogene, S.A. is expected to initiate a clinical trial for its gene therapy treatment for GM1. Additionally, other companies are developing product candidates for the treatment of Krabbe disease such as Chiesi, Ranedis, Passage Bio, MediciNova and Polaryx, which are in the discovery and preclinical stages, and Magenta which is developing a cell-based approach for various inherited metabolic disorders, including Krabbe disease, which is in clinical trials. Companies such as Prevail Therapeutics and Apollo Therapeutics are developing candidates targeting GCase and GBA1 to address type 2 and type 3 Gaucher’s disease and are in the preclinical and clinical stage for certain candidates. We may also face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions with genetic medicine and other therapeutic approaches. 
Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. These may include larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations and resources. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than any product candidates that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, new or advanced technologies developed by our competitors may render our current or future product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors. For more information about the risks and challenges we face, see "Risk Factors" under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Strategic Transactions; Collaboration and Licensing Arrangements
In connection with our business development activities, we enter into collaborative and licensing arrangement with third parties, to use our licensed SEE-Tx® computational platform technology to discover novel allosteric sites on misfolded proteins and identify proprietary small molecules that bind these sites, potentially restoring protein folding and treating disease. We expect to continue to identify and evaluate collaboration, co-development and licensing opportunities that may be similar to or different from the collaborations and licenses that we have entered into. 
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co.
 In September 2020, we entered into a strategic research collaboration agreement with Sumitomo for the research and development of structurally targeted allosteric regulators to restore functional activity of defective lysosomal enzymes in rare genetic and demyelinating diseases. While the goals of the first phase of the research project have been achieved, Sumitomo determined not to continue the research collaboration, and informed the Company on March 22, 2022, that it will send a formal notice letter in due course.
Zentalis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
On April 20, 2021, the Company entered into a multi-target collaboration agreement with Zentalis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Zentalis”) to discover new product candidates for the treatment of cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will use its licensed SEE-Tx® computational platform technology to identify binding site on target proteins and determine the potential suitability of these sites as drug targets, as well as their prospective therapeutic use in oncology. Pursuant the terms of the agreement, Zentalis agreed to pay the Company, on a program-by-program basis, a non-creditable, non-refundable, program initiation fee and reimburse of expenses incurred by the Company in accordance with the agreed-upon research budget. 

19

Unless terminated earlier, the agreement expires at the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patents, subject to certain surviving rights and obligations. Zentalis and the Company can each terminate the agreement in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, or a material breach by the other party and failure to cure such breach within a certain period of time. Zentalis shall have the right, at its sole discretion, exercisable at any time to terminate the agreement on a program-by-program basis, upon ninety (90) days’ prior written notice to the Company or, at any time, if a safety concerns arises with respect to any development program or product. 
In May 2021, the first target development program was identified, and the estimated development cost were approved and collected in July 2021. The transaction price of this first target development program includes (i) $50 thousand of fixed consideration as program initiation fee, (ii) up to $272 thousand as reimbursement for employee and external research and development cost, (iii) $250 thousand subject to the exercise of a research program option, (iv) up to $41.5 million of variable consideration in the form of event-based milestone payments, if goals will be met in the future, and (v) other royalty-based payments based on future net sales.  The research project is progressing in accordance with the agreed upon research plans.
Minoryx Therapeutics, S.L.
We have entered into a license agreement, dated December 20, 2017 (the “Minoryx License Agreement”), with Minoryx Therapeutics, S.L., a company organized under the laws of Spain (“Minoryx”), pursuant to which we obtained exclusive worldwide license rights from Minoryx to use and exploit its intellectual property (“IP”), including its SEE-Tx® discovery platform for the identification of non-competitive pharmacological chaperones and exclusive worldwide sublicense rights to certain IP licensed by Minoryx from the University of Barcelona and the Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats.

Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and our product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
As of February 2022, our patent portfolio consisted of five pending European patent applications and related national stage applications. In regards to our SEE-Tx® Technology, we in-license a European patent under the Minoryx License Agreement, which is owned by UB/ICREA and has claims directed to a method of binding site and binding energy determination by mixed explicit solvent simulations. This patent is expected to expire in 2032.
In regards to our GLB program, we in-license from Minoryx pursuant to the Minoryx License Agreement, a patent family with a pending European patent application with claims directed to composition of matter and 8 foreign patent applications pending in such jurisdictions such as Canada, Australia, Japan, Europe, and China. These patents applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2037, not giving effect to any potential patent term extensions and patent term adjustments and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees.
In regards to our GBA program, we in-license from Minoryx pursuant to the Minoryx License Agreement, a patent family with a pending European patent application with claims directed to composition of matter and 8 foreign patent applications pending in such jurisdictions such as Canada, Australia, Japan, Europe, and China. These patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2037, not giving effect to any potential patent term extensions and patent term adjustments and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees.
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date or the filing date of a PCT application that designates the United States. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, which is typically the filing date of the PCT application. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our 

21



collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to March 16, 2013 in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.
Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, as amended, its implementing regulations and other laws. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval or any other legal requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, withdrawal of approvals, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before our product candidates are approved as drugs for therapeutic indications and may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

● | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA, to accept the filing for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22




● | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials for Drugs
Before testing any drug in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research patients will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trial are minimized and are reasonable related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about clinical trials, including clinical trials results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor can submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.
●Phase I—Phase I clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
●Phase II—Phase II clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
●Phase III—Phase III clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical 

23



efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the severity or rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Marketing Approval for Drugs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy. The marketing application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the U.S.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.

24



The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS program could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk-minimization tools.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, 

25



unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Expedited Development and Review Programs for Drugs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients earlier than under standard FDA development and review procedures.
A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below.
In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase I, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under Priority Review, the FDA must review an application in six months compared to ten months for a standard review.
Additionally, products are eligible for Accelerated Approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under Accelerated Approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process.

U.S. Post-Approval Requirements for Drugs
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or withdrawal of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of 

27



the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Healthcare Reform
In March 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional policy reforms. The ACA, for example, contains provisions that subject products to potential competition by lower-cost products and may reduce the profitability of products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs; address a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increase the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; establish annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs; and create a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, administrative, executive and Congressional legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing constitutional challenges in the U.S. Supreme Court, the Trump Administration has issued various Executive Orders eliminating cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices, and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended, and we cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business.
Other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted:

● | The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030, unless additional Congressional action is taken. These Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required that CMS reduce the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule by 2% in 2013, which served as a base for 2014 and subsequent years.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In addition, effective January 1, 2014, CMS also began bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest 

28



in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid healthcare costs. For example, the U.S. government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors to participate in federal healthcare programs. Further, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs, and the current administration recently released a “Blueprint,” or plan, to reduce the cost of drugs. The Blueprint contains certain measures that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is already working to implement. Individual states in the U.S. have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Additionally, we may face competition in the United States for our development candidates and investigational medicines, if approved, from therapies sourced from foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, contains provisions that call for the promulgation of regulations that expand pharmacists’ and wholesalers’ ability to import cheaper versions of an approved drug and competing products from Canada, where there are government price controls. Further, the MMA provides that these changes to U.S. importation laws will not take effect, unless and until the Secretary of the HHS certifies that the changes will pose no additional risk to the public’s health and safety and will result in a significant reduction in the cost of products to consumers. On September 23, 2020, the Secretary of the HHS made such certification to Congress, and on October 1, 2020, the FDA published a final rule that allows for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. Under the final rule, States and Indian Tribes, and in certain future circumstances pharmacists and wholesalers, may submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and authorization. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by States under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. Separately, the FDA also issued a final guidance document outlining a pathway for manufacturers to obtain an additional National Drug Code, or NDC, for an FDA-approved drug that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and that was authorized for sale in that foreign country. The market implications of the final rule and guidance are unknown at this time. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability. Individual states in the U.S. have also been increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the sale, marketing, coverage, and reimbursement of products regulated by CMS or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, CMS regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways significantly affecting our business and our products.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing strategies. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant civil monetary and criminal penalties, per kickback plus three times the amount of remuneration and a prison term per violation. Further, violation of the federal 

29



Anti-Kickback Statute can also form the basis for False Claims Act liability (discussed below). A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only government programs.
Additionally, the civil False Claims Act (the “FCA”) prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in very significant monetary penalties, for each false claim and treble the amount of the government’s damages. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The federal government continues to use the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations and prosecutions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S. Such investigations and prosecutions frequently involve, for example, the alleged promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with the FCA and other applicable fraud and abuse laws.
We may be subject to the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Federal government price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs.
The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, includes a fraud and abuse provision referred to as the HIPAA All-Payor Fraud Law, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Many states also have laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA will require covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General commenced enforcement actions against violators beginning July 1, 2020. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. The California Attorney General has proposed draft regulations, which have not been finalized to date, that may further impact our business activities if they are adopted. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of CCPA exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.

30



We may also be subject to federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which was part of the ACA and requires manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics, among others, to track and disclose payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. This information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Failure to disclose required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and/or other healthcare providers.
As noted above, analogous state laws and regulations, such as, state anti-kickback and false claims laws may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. There are also state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, imprisonment, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
Government Regulation of Drugs Outside of the United States
To market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization or identification of an alternate regulatory pathway, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For instance, in the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area, or the EEA (comprised of the 27 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
●Centralized procedure—If pursuing marketing authorization of a product candidate for a therapeutic indication under the centralized procedure, following the opinion of the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or, CHMP, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes or advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, as long as the medicine 

31



concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops.
●National authorization procedures—There are also two other possible routes to authorize products for therapeutic indications in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
●Decentralized procedure—Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
●Mutual recognition procedure—In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country.
●Following authorization through either procedure, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.

In the EEA, new products for therapeutic indications that are authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In the EEA a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no marketing authorization application shall be accepted, and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.

The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific trial site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will apply following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS, the centralized European Union portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the regulation, through an independent audit. The regulation becomes applicable six months after the European Commission publishes notice of this confirmation. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union, previously governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, is now governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. While the Data Protection Directive did not apply to organizations based outside the EU, the GDPR has expanded its reach to include any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU. This expansion would incorporate any clinical trial activities in EU members states. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for “sensitive information” which includes health and genetic information of data patients residing in the EU. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the U.S. or other regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of global revenues, or €20,000,000, whichever is greater. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules.
There is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance are onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Should we utilize third-party distributors, compliance with such foreign governmental regulations would generally be the responsibility of such distributors, who may be independent contractors over whom we have limited control.

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FD&C Act also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FD&C Act provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FD&C Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
