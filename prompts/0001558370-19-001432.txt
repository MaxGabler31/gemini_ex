 Item 1.    Business
 Company Overview 
 ImmunoGen is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing the next generation of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). By innovating targeted therapies with enhanced anti-tumor activity and favorable tolerability profiles, we aim to disrupt disease progression and deliver more good days to people living with cancer.  We call this our commitment to “target a better now.”
 An ADC with our proprietary technology comprises an antibody that binds to a target found on tumor cells and is conjugated to one of our potent anti-cancer agents as a “payload” to kill the tumor cell once the ADC has bound to its target. ADCs are an established, growing, and important approach to the treatment of cancer, with four approved products on the market and the number of agents in development growing significantly in recent years.
 We have established a leadership position in ADCs, with a robust portfolio and a productive platform that has generated differentiated candidates for cancer treatment. Our proprietary portfolio is led by mirvetuximab soravtansine, a first-in-class ADC targeting folate-receptor alpha, or FRα.  In late 2016, we initiated a Phase 3 registration trial, FORWARD I, with mirvetuximab for use as single-agent therapy to treat patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The FORWARD I Phase 3 trial randomized 366 patients 2:1 to receive either mirvetuximab or the physician's choice of

single-agent chemotherapy (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, or weekly paclitaxel). Eligibility criteria included patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer that expressed medium or high levels of FRα who had been treated with up to three prior regimens. The primary endpoint of this study was progression-free survival (PFS), which was assessed using the Hochberg procedure in the entire study population and in the subset of patients with high FRα expression. The Hochberg procedure enables the simultaneous testing of two overlapping populations. Under this statistical analysis plan, if the p-value of the primary endpoint in either population is greater than 0.05, the p-value in the other population needs to be less than or equal to 0.025 to achieve statistical significance.
 On March 1, 2019, we announced that FORWARD I did not meet its PFS primary endpoint in either the entire study population or in the pre-specified subset of patients with high FRα expression. In the entire study population, the confirmed overall response rate was higher for mirvetuximab than for chemotherapy (22% vs 12%, p-value 0.015), without a significant difference in the primary endpoint of PFS (HR 0.98, p-value 0.897) or overall survival (HR 0.81, p-value 0.248).  In the pre-specified high FRα subgroup (218/366, 60%), PFS was longer in patients who received mirvetuximab compared with chemotherapy (HR 0.69, p-value 0.049). Given that the p-value in the entire study population exceeded 0.05, the statistical analysis plan for the study required the p-value in the high subset to be less than or equal to 0.025 to achieve statistical significance. Confirmed overall response rate was higher for mirvetuximab than for chemotherapy (24% vs 10%, p-value 0.014) and overall survival was longer in patients who received mirvetuximab compared with chemotherapy (HR 0.62, p-value 0.033). Mirvetuximab was well-tolerated, with fewer patients experiencing grade 3 or greater adverse events (46% vs 61%), fewer dose reductions (20% vs 31%), and fewer discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events (5% vs 8%) compared with chemotherapy. The safety profile of mirvetuximab was confirmed, with the most common adverse events including nausea (54% all grades; 2% grade 3 or greater), diarrhea (44% all grades; 4% grade 3 or greater), and blurred vision (43% all grades; 3% grade 3 or greater).
 We plan to conduct a full review of the FORWARD I data to determine potential next steps with mirvetuximab as a single agent, and assess our ongoing FORWARD II combination studies as a separate path forward to support a registration in ovarian cancer.
 Mirvetuximab is also being assessed in multiple combinations in FORWARD II, a Phase 1b/2 study of the agent in combination with Avastin® (bevacizumab) or Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in patients with Frα-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as a triplet combination of mirvetuximab plus carboplatin and bevacizumab in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In 2018, we presented combination data from more than 100 patients, beginning with data from the dose-escalation FORWARD II cohort evaluating mirvetuximab in combination with pembrolizumab at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting, which demonstrated encouraging efficacy and favorable tolerability in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Based on these data, we enrolled an additional 35 patients with medium or high FRα expression levels in an expansion cohort in the FORWARD II study.  Findings from the combined dose escalation and expansion cohorts were presented at the 2018 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in October and confirmed the safety of the combination and the activity of mirvetuximab in heavily pretreated ovarian cancer patients in terms of response rate with a trend towards improved duration of response with the addition of pembrolizumab. We plan to present data from the mature cohort during 2019, the results of which will determine our approach to further development of this combination.
 We also reported updated data from the FORWARD II dose-escalation cohort evaluating mirvetuximab in combination with carboplatin in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.  The updated data demonstrated a favorable safety profile along with an increased response rate and more durable benefit after longer-term follow up.  In June, we presented data from the FORWARD II expansion cohort evaluating mirvetuximab in combination with bevacizumab at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, which demonstrated anti-tumor activity with durable responses and favorable tolerability in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Taken together, findings from these doublets supported the initiation of the ongoing FORWARD II cohort assessing a triplet combination of mirvetuximab plus carboplatin and bevacizumab in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.  We completed enrollment of the triplet in late 2018 and expect to report data from this cohort in 2019.        We have built a productive platform that continues to generate innovative and proprietary ADCs, including IMGN632, our CD123-targeting product candidate in clinical trials for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), and IMGN779, our CD33-targeting product candidate in clinical trials for patients with AML. Initial data from the Phase 1 study of IMGN632 in patients with relapsed or refractory adult AML and BPDCN were presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2018.

IMGN632 was shown to display anti-leukemic activity across all dose levels tested and a tolerable safety profile at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg. Enrollment in expansion cohorts is ongoing to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for both AML and BPDCN. Updated data from the IMGN779 Phase 1 dose finding study in AML patients were also presented at ASH; these data show that IMGN779 continues to display a tolerable safety profile with repeat dosing across a wide range of doses explored in patients with relapsed AML, with anti-leukemic activity seen at doses ≥0.39 mg/kg in both schedules. Enrollment is ongoing to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule.
 Collaborating on ADC development with other companies allows us to generate revenue, mitigate expenses, enhance our capabilities, and extend the reach of our proprietary platform. The most advanced partner program is Roche’s marketed product, Kadcyla® (ado-trastuzumab emtansine). In October of 2018, Roche announced that, in a Phase 3 study (the “KATHERINE Study”), Kadcyla significantly improved invasive disease-free survival compared to Herceptin® (trastuzumab) in individuals with HER2-positive early breast cancer with residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment. Our ADC platform is used in candidates in clinical development with Bayer, Biotest, CytomX, Debiopharm, Novartis, Oxford BioTherapeutics/Menarini, and Sanofi. In addition, we have an ongoing strategic collaboration and option agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc to develop and co-commercialize ADCs, which we executed in August of 2017. Jazz has exclusive worldwide rights to opt into development and commercialization of IMGN779, IMGN632, and a third program to be named later from our early-stage pipeline. We also have a partnership with Takeda, who advanced their first candidate with our ADC technology deploying our IGN payload into clinical testing for solid tumors in the first half of 2018.
 We expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from payments under our collaborative arrangements. In addition to the discussion below for agreements with activity in the periods presented, details for all of our significant agreements can be found in Note C, Significant Collaborative Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
 Our Strategy
  Our goal is to build a fully-integrated company capable of delivering a sustainable pipeline of innovative ADC therapies to cancer patients around the globe.  We will achieve this goal by focusing on four strategic priorities: 
· | Execute speed-to-market strategy for mirvetuximab. Our first priority is to complete development and obtain full approval for mirvetuximab in ovarian cancer in the United States (U.S.) and European Union (EU).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Accelerate novel ADC pipeline. We have prioritized our product candidates with the highest potential for differentiation and, to this end, we have emphasized ADCs deploying our novel DNA-alkylating payload, which we call IGNs. With a potentially broad therapeutic index, we believe we can increase the number of cancers addressable by ADC therapies with this technology. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sustain leadership in ADC field through platform innovation. We have generated significant expertise in understanding the factors that drive successful development of ADCs. This understanding has produced a comprehensive set of capabilities for antibody, linker, and payload development and ADC manufacturing. We have paired this platform with an in-house team experienced in developing and commercializing oncology products from the bench to the patient. We believe this depth of know-how, capabilities, and experience has positioned us for sustained leadership in ADCs for oncology with the goal of bringing forward an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for candidates from our portfolio every 12-18 months. The latest addition to our development portfolio is IMGC936, a first-in-class ADC directed to ADAM-9 expressing tumors that we are co-developing with MacroGenics, Inc., and our goal is to file an IND for this program by the end of 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand reach and strengthen financials through partnerships. We will continue to lever our platform to support our existing relationships and pursue new collaborations that expand the reach of our innovation, generate revenue, mitigate expenses, and expand our capabilities to enable more patients to be treated with ADCs deploying our technology.

 ADCs and our Technology Platform
 The molecular profile of tumors has increasingly formed the basis for treatment decisions for cancer patients.  Within this evolving landscape, we believe ADCs will play an important and growing role by offering targeted therapy with the potential for stand-alone activity and a tolerability profile to enable combinations with existing and novel therapies to improve outcomes for people living with cancer.  To this end, over the last five years, the number of ADCs in the clinic has more than doubled, with approximately 80 product candidates now under active evaluation, including more than 15 ADCs in late-stage development.  
 For more than three decades, we have provided leadership in ADC development with the most comprehensive “tool box” in the field.   Together with the accumulated experience of our research team, these capabilities have enabled us to generate a pipeline of novel candidates optimized for individual tumor types with potent anti-tumor activity and tolerable safety profiles that includes ten product candidates currently in the clinic between us and our partners. 
 Our ADC platform combines advanced chemistry and biochemistry with innovative approaches to antibody optimization, with an emphasis on increasing the diversity and potency of our payload agents, advancing antibody-payload linkage and release technologies, and integrating novel antibody engineering technologies.  Consistent with this approach, we have developed tubulin-acting maytansinoid payload agents, which include DM1 and DM4.  Our maytansinoid technology is used in Kadcyla, mirvetuximab soravtansine, and all other ADCs in development by us and our partners that entered the clinic prior to 2016.  Our new class of IGN payloads is used in IMGN779 and IMGN632, as well as in the GCC-targeting ADC, TAK-164, being developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda). which entered Phase 1 clinical testing in 2018. Other enabling technologies in our portfolio include a growing array of stable-engineered linkers, which direct the release and activation of the payload agent inside the cancer cell, alternative methods of conjugation and antibody assessment, screening, and targeting approaches to enable the optimal ADC design for the antigen target.  In addition, we are collaborating with companies such as CytomX Therapeutics, Inc. to gain access to novel approaches to antibody engineering such as masking technology.

 The following table summarizes the current status of our product candidates in human clinical development and for which we retain commercial rights:

ImmunoGen Wholly-Owned Product Candidate | Target | Lead Indication | Lead Stage
Mirvetuximab soravtansine | FRα | Platinum-resistant ovarian cancer | Phase 3 
IMGN779* | CD33 | AML | Phase 1 
IMGN632* | CD123 | AML, BPDCN | Phase I 

      *Subject to Collaboration and Option Agreement with Jazz.
     Mirvetuximab Soravtansine: First-in-class ADC Targeting FRα for Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer
 Our proprietary portfolio is led by mirvetuximab soravtansine, a first-in-class ADC targeting FRα. Mirvetuximab has a differentiated profile with a distinct mechanism of action and is the first ADC to enter pivotal development for the treatment of ovarian cancer. It comprises a FRα-binding antibody, which serves to target the ADC to FR-expressing cancer cells, and our potent DM4 payload agent to kill the targeted cancer cells. It has demonstrated activity in platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer with a safety profile that supports expanded use as a combination agent. It has been granted orphan drug status for ovarian cancer in the U.S. and the European Union, as well as Fast Track Designation by the FDA.
 We have developed a comprehensive strategy for mirvetuximab with the goals of displacing single-agent chemotherapy in the treatment of ovarian cancer and to be the preferred agent for combination treatment of the disease. Beyond ovarian cancer, we believe the opportunity for mirvetuximab may be further expanded with other FRα-positive cancers, including non-small cell lung, endometrial, and triple negative breast cancers.
 Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women in the U.S.  Initial treatment typically entails tumor-debulking surgery, followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. Once the cancer becomes platinum-

resistant, patients may receive a wide array of treatments. There remains an urgent need to improve treatment of ovarian cancer, with current treatment options characterized by low response rates, short duration of response, and significant side effects.
 FORWARD I: Single-agent therapy for platinum-resistant disease
 We are conducting a Phase 3 registration trial, FORWARD I, with mirvetuximab for use as single-agent therapy to treat patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer whose tumors express high or medium levels of FRα and who have received up to three prior treatment regimens. We estimate 8,000 patients per year in the U.S. meet these criteria. FORWARD I enrolled a total of 366 patients, who were randomized 2:1 to mirvetuximab soravtansine, or physician's choice, which includes PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin, or PLD, or topotecan, or weekly paclitaxel. The primary endpoint of the trial is PFS, which will be assessed for high FRα expressers only and for all patients (high and medium FRα expressers). In 2018, we fully enrolled FORWARD I, and successfully completed an interim analysis after 80 PFS events. On March 1, 2019, we announced that FORWARD I did not meet its PFS primary endpoint in either the entire study population or in the pre-specified subset of patients with high-FRexpression. Based upon the efficacy signals we observed in the high FRα subset with PFS, confirmed overall response rate and overall survival, we are conducting additional analyses to further evaluate the potential benefit of mirvetuximab soravtansine for FRα-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
 FORWARD II: Combination therapy for expanded patient population
     Additionally, we are accruing patients in a companion study, FORWARD II, to evaluate mirvetuximab in combination regimens to potentially expand the number of patients with ovarian cancer eligible for treatment with the ADC, including to those with platinum-sensitive disease. We reported the first clinical data from FORWARD II at ASCO in June 2017. These data demonstrated that full doses of mirvetuximab combined in doublets with full doses of carboplatin, bevacizumab, and pembrolizumab yielded a favorable safety profile and encouraging efficacy. As a result, we advanced expansion cohorts for the bevacizumab and pembrolizumab combinations to Phase 2 testing in platinum-resistant disease and initiated a triplet combination evaluating mirvetuximab plus carboplatin and bevicizumab in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In 2019, we plan to present initial triplet and mature doublet expansion cohort data at a future medical meeting, and, while we continue to evaluate a mirvetuximab strategy in light of the FORWARD I data, we currently plan to enroll patients in an additional bevacizumab cohort in platinum-agnostic ovarian cancer.
 IMGN779 and IMGN632: First-in-class ADCs for AML and Other Hematological Malignancies
 We have also developed a new class of indolino-benzodiazepine DNA-acting payload agents that we refer to as IGNs. Our IGNs alkylate DNA without cross-linking, which we have found to provide a broad therapeutic index in preclinical models. Specifically, IGN ADCs have demonstrated the ability to retain the anti-tumor potency of crosslinking drugs with less toxicity to normal cells in in vitro and animal models. This potentially allows for repeat administration with reduced cumulative toxicity compared to an ADC with a crosslinking payload. Our IMGN632 and IMGN779 product candidates use our IGN payloads.
 We are advancing IMGN632, a CD123-targeting ADC that utilizes one of our novel IGN payloads  with a new engineered linker and novel antibody, which we are developing for hematological malignancies, including AML and BPDCN. In January 2018, we announced that the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1 trial of IMGN632. Since then, IMGN632 was granted Orphan-Drug Designation by the FDA as a treatment for AML and we presented encouraging data at ASH 2018 that showed anti-leukemic activity across all dose levels tested, including complete responses in both AML and BPDCN, and a tolerable safety profile at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg. In 2019, we are moving forward to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for IMGN632 and initiate combination studies.
 IMGN779 combines a high-affinity, humanized anti-CD33 antibody with a different IGN payload. Also granted Orphan-Drug Designation by the FDA, IMGN779 data presented at ASH 2018 showed tolerability with repeat dosing across a wide range of doses in patients with relapsed AML and demonstrated anti-leukemia activity in 41% of patients. In 2019, we are moving forward to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule to enable further development as a combination therapy in AML.

 Collaborations and Out‑Licenses
 In conjunction with our strategy review in 2016, we have evolved our approach to partnering to prioritize relationships where we can gain access to complementary capabilities, strengthen our financial position, and create long-term value for the company by retaining co-development and co-commercialization rights. Our collaborations with Jazz Pharmaceuticals and MacroGenics reflect this approach to partnering.  
 We have selectively licensed restricted access to our ADC platform technology to other companies to expand the use of our technology and to provide us with cash to fund our own product programs. These agreements typically provide the licensee with rights to use our ADC platform technology with its antibodies or related targeting vehicles to a defined target to develop products. The licensee is generally responsible for the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, registration and commercialization of any resulting product candidate. As part of these agreements, we are generally entitled to receive upfront fees, potential milestone payments, royalties on the sales of any resulting products, and research and development funding based on activities performed at our collaborative partner’s request.  
 We only receive royalty payments from our ADC platform technology out‑licenses after a product candidate developed under the license has been approved for marketing and commercialized. Additionally, the largest milestone payments under our existing collaborations usually are on later‑stage events, such as commencement of pivotal clinical trials, product approval and achievement of defined annual sales levels. Achievement of product approval requires, at a minimum, favorable completion of preclinical development and evaluation, assessment in early‑stage clinical trials, advancement into pivotal Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 clinical testing, completion of this later‑stage clinical testing with favorable results, and completion of regulatory submissions and a positive regulatory decision. Below is a table setting forth our active ADC partnerships and current status of the most advanced program in each partnership: 

Partner | Licensed targets | Status of Most Advanced Program
Roche | HER2, 4 other1 | Marketed 
Bayer | Mesothelin | Phase 2 
Biotest | CD-138 | Phase1/ 2 
Novartis | cKit, pCadherin, CDH6, 2 others1 | Phase 1 
Oxford BioTherapeutics/Menarini | CD2052 | Phase 1 
CytomX | CD166 | Phase 1 
Takeda | GCC | Phase 1 
Jazz | CD333, CD1233 | Phase 1 
Debiopharm | CD374 | Phase 2 

      1 Undisclosed
 2 Oxford BioTherapeutics and Menarini are developing MEN 1309, an ADC targeting CD205 and utilizing our DM4 payload, pursuant to a sublicense from Amgen, which in turn licensed our maytansinoid ADC technology to develop and commercialize ADCs targeting CD205.
 3 Jazz has exclusive worldwide rights to opt into development and commercialization of IMGN779 (CD33) and IMGN632 (CD123)
 4 Debiopharm has an exclusive license for Debio 1562 (formerly known as IMGN529)
     Below is a brief description of the business relationships underlying each of the foregoing programs. For more information concerning these relationships, including their ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note C, Significant Collaborative Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
 Roche
 In 2000, we granted Genentech, now a unit of Roche, an exclusive development and commercialization license to use our maytansinoid technology with antibodies that target HER2. Roche’s Kadcyla resulted from this license. Kadcyla was approved for marketing in the U.S., EU and Japan in 2013. We are entitled to receive up to a total of $44 million in milestone payments, of which we have received $34 million to date, and also tiered royalties on the commercial sales of Kadcyla or any other resulting products as described below. Roche is responsible for the development, manufacturing, and marketing of any products resulting from this license.

 In 2015, Immunity Royalty Holdings, L.P., or IRH, paid us $200 million to purchase our right to receive 100% of the royalty payments on commercial sales of Kadcyla arising under our development and commercialization license with Genentech, until IRH had received aggregate Kadcyla royalties equal to $235 million or $260 million, depending on when the aggregate Kadcyla royalties received by IRH reached a specified milestone. Once the applicable threshold would have been met, if ever, we would thereafter have received 85% and IRH would have received 15% of the Kadcyla royalties for the remaining royalty term. In January 2019, we sold our residual rights to receive royalty payments on commercial sales of Kadcyla to OMERS, the defined benefit pension plan for municipal employees in the Province of Ontario, Canada, for $65.2 million, net of $1.5 million of transaction fees. Simultaneously, OMERS purchased IRH’s right to the royalties we previously sold to IRH as described above, therefore obtaining the rights to 100% of the royalties received from that date on.
 We also granted Roche, through its Genentech unit, exclusive development and commercialization licenses to use our maytansinoid ADC technology with antibodies to four specified targets, which were granted under the terms of a separate, now expired 2000 right‑to‑test agreement with Genentech. For each of these licenses, we are entitled to receive up to a total of $38 million in milestone payments and also royalties on the sales of any resulting products. Roche is responsible for the development, manufacturing, and marketing of any products resulting from these licenses. The standard termination provisions discussed below apply to these licenses.

 CytomX
 In 2016, we granted CytomX an exclusive development and commercialization license to our maytansinoid and IGN ADC technology for use with Probodies™ that target CD166 under a now-expired reciprocal right-to-test agreement. We are entitled to receive up to a total of $160 million in milestone payments plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting product. CytomX is responsible for the manufacturing, product development, and marketing of any products resulting from this license. The standard termination provisions discussed below apply to this license.

In 2017, we took exclusive development and commercialization licenses to CytomX’s proprietary antibody-masking (Probody) technology for use with Probodies that target two specified targets under the same reciprocal right-to-test agreement. We terminated one of these licenses for convenience prior to the end of 2017. With respect to the remaining license, we are obligated to pay up to a total of $80 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting product. We are responsible for the manufacturing, product development, and marketing of any products resulting from this license. 
 We may terminate the remaining license from CytomX for convenience at any time. The license may also be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. Unless earlier terminated, the license will continue in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations, which are determined on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis. For each product and country, our royalty obligations commence upon first commercial sale of that product in that country, and extend until the later of either the expiration of the last‑to‑expire ImmunoGen patent covering that product in that country or the expiration for that country of the minimum royalty period specified in the license. We may also be required to pay annual maintenance fees to CytomX if no product candidate under the license has progressed to a specified state of development within a specified time frame.

We are entitled to receive up to a total of $210 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. Takeda is responsible for the manufacturing, product development, and marketing of any products resulting from this license. The standard termination provisions discussed below apply to this license. In March 2018, the right-to-test agreement expired without Takeda exercising its option to a second license or extending or expanding the agreement as it had the right to do for a third license. Jazz
  In August 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with a subsidiary of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, pursuant to which we granted Jazz options to develop and commercialize, on an exclusive, worldwide basis, IMGN779, IMGN632, and a third ADC from our early research and development pipeline to be designated by Jazz within the first seven years of the Option Agreement term. Each of the foregoing three products is referred to herein as a “Collaboration Product.”  Jazz is entitled to exercise its option with respect to each Collaboration Product during specified periods set forth in the Option Agreement. Each Collaboration Product for which Jazz has exercised its option is referred to herein as a “Licensed Product.” We have the right to co-commercialize with Jazz a single Licensed Product (except under certain limited circumstances under which we may be entitled to co-commercialize two Licensed Products), to be designated by us, in the U.S.
     Under the terms of the Option Agreement, we received a non-refundable $75 million upfront option fee. Jazz has also agreed to provide up to $100 million in development funding over seven years to support development of the Collaboration Products. Jazz has the right to opt out of a Collaboration Product under the Option Agreement upon prior notice to us, which would result in a pro-rata reduction of its obligation to provide development funding. We are obligated to use a specified level of efforts to advance the development of the Collaboration Products, and we are responsible for all development costs with respect to the Collaboration Products in excess of Jazz’s development funding.
     Jazz may exercise its option with respect to each Collaboration Product at any time prior to a pivotal study or any time prior to a biologics license application (BLA) upon payment of an option exercise fee of mid-double digit millions or low-triple digit millions, respectively. The option exercise fee for IMGN632 is subject to certain adjustments 

 
  10

 
depending on the indication(s) for which initial regulatory approval of this product is based. The option exercise fee would be reduced with respect to the Licensed Product designated by us for co-commercialization if Jazz exercised its option for that Licensed Product at the later stage of development. After any option exercise by Jazz, we will share equally with Jazz the costs associated with developing and obtaining regulatory approvals of each Licensed Product in the U.S. and the European Union, and Jazz will be solely responsible for such costs with respect to all other territories worldwide.
     We are also entitled to receive milestone payments upon US and EU regulatory approvals for each Licensed Product, plus tiered royalties as a percentage of commercial sales which, depending on sales levels and the stage of development at the time of Jazz’s option exercise, range from the mid- to high-single digits in the lowest tier, to low 10’s to low 20’s in the highest tier. With respect to the Licensed Product designated by us for co-commercialization, in lieu of receiving a milestone payment based on receiving regulatory approval in the U.S., or royalties on sales in the U.S., we will share equally with Jazz the activities, costs, and profits associated with commercialization in the U.S.  The standard termination provisions discussed below apply to the Option Agreement and the license agreements associated with the Licensed Products (“License Agreements”), except that any License Agreement for a Licensed Product being co-commercialized by the parties in the U.S. shall remain in effect as long as the parties continue to be engaged in such co-commercialization activities, subject to earlier termination in the event of a material breach.
     If Jazz does not exercise its option to a Collaboration Product or opts out of a Collaboration Product or a Licensed Product, rights to that product revert to us, and we may continue development and commercialization of that product without any further involvement by Jazz, except that we would pay Jazz royalties at a rate specified in the Option Agreement or License Agreement, as applicable, on our commercial sales of such product.
     Debiopharm
  In May 2017, we entered into an Exclusive License and Asset Purchase Agreement with Debiopharm International, S.A., pursuant to which Debiopharm acquired our antibody-drug conjugate IMGN529, a potential new treatment for patients with CD37-positive B-cell malignancies, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The transaction includes the sale to Debiopharm of specified intellectual property and other assets related to the IMGN529 program, and an exclusive license to additional intellectual property necessary or useful for Debiopharm to develop and commercialize IMGN529 (now known as Debio 1562).
     Under the terms of the agreement, we received a $25 million upfront payment for the IMGN529 program and a $4.5 million milestone payment following the transfer of technology relating to IMGN529 to Debiopharm, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. The final $500,000 for the milestone was received in January 2018.  In addition, we are entitled to a $25 million milestone upon IMGN529/Debio 1562 entering a Phase 3 clinical trial. Except for the foregoing upfront and milestone payments, we will not be entitled to receive any additional milestone payments or royalties under the agreement.
     Standard Termination Provisions
 Standard termination provisions in our license agreements state that the partner may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time upon prior written notice to us. The agreement may also be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. We may also terminate certain of these agreements upon the occurrence of specified events. Upon termination, the partner’s rights to our intellectual property with respect to the applicable target are cancelled and could then be used by us or re-licensed for that target. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of partner’s royalty obligations, which are determined on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis. For each product and country, royalty obligations commence upon first commercial sale of that product in that country, and extend until the later of either the expiration of the last‑to‑expire ImmunoGen patent covering that product in that country or the expiration for that country of the minimum royalty period specified in the agreement.     Other Agreements
 From time to time we have entered into additional agreements with some of our collaborators pursuant to which we have provided certain CMC-related development and pre-pivotal ADC manufacturing services, or supplied ADC

payloads, to them with respect to products they are developing under their licenses with us, with respect to which we have been entitled to receive payments at mutually negotiated rates.
 Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets
 ImmunoGen has a substantial and robust intellectual property portfolio comprising more than 1,000 issued patents and over 600 pending patent applications on a worldwide basis. Our intellectual property strategy centers on obtaining high quality patent protection directed to various embodiments of our proprietary technologies and product candidates. Using this strategy, our ADC technology and our product candidates are protected through a multi layered approach. In this regard, we have patents and patent applications covering antibodies and other cell binding agents, linkers, cytotoxic payload agents (e.g., tubulin acting maytansinoids and DNA acting IGNs), conjugation methodologies and complete ADCs, comprising one or more of these components, as well as methods of making and using each of the above. Typically, multiple issued patents and pending patent applications cover various embodiments of each of ImmunoGen’s and our licensees’ product candidates.
 We consider our tubulin-acting maytansinoid and DNA-acting IGN cytotoxic payload agent technologies to be key components of our overall patent strategy.  With regard to our tubulin-acting maytansinoid cytotoxic payload agents, we currently own 22 issued U.S. patents covering various embodiments of our maytansinoid technology including those with claims directed to certain maytansinoids, including DM4, and methods of manufacturing of both DM1 and DM4, as well as methods of using the same. These issued patents remain in force until various times between 2020 and 2033.  With regard to our IGN payload agents, we have 20 issued U.S. patents covering various aspects of our DNA-acting cytotoxic payload agents, which will expire at various times between 2030 and 2036.  In all cases, we have received or are applying for comparable patents in other major commercial and manufacturing jurisdictions, including Europe, Japan, and China.  In nearly all cases for both our maytansinoid and IGN patent portfolios, we have additional pending patent applications disclosing and claiming many other related and strategically important embodiments of these technologies which, upon issuance or grant, will extend our patent protection term over these technologies by several additional years.
 Our intellectual property strategy also includes pursuing patents directed to linkers, antibodies, conjugation methods, ADC formulations and the use of specific antibodies and ADCs to treat certain diseases.  In this regard, we have 21 issued patents related to many of our linker technologies, as well as additional pending patent applications disclosing and claiming many other related and strategically important embodiments of these linker technologies.  The issued patents, expiring in 2021-2034, and any patents which may issue from the patent applications, cover the linkers, methods of making the linkers and antibody maytansinoid conjugates comprising these linkers.  We also have 15 issued U.S. patents covering methods of assembling ADCs from their constituent antibody, linker, and cytotoxic payload agent moieties.  These issued patents will expire in 2022-2037.  In nearly all instances for both our linker and conjugation patent portfolios, we have additional pending patent applications disclosing and claiming many other related and strategically important embodiments of these technologies which, upon issuance or grant, will extend our patent protection term over these technologies by several additional years. In all cases, we have received or are applying for comparable patents in other major commercial and manufacturing jurisdictions including Europe, Japan, and China.  
 We also file, prosecute, and maintain a substantial portfolio of patents and patent applications specifically directed to ImmunoGen’s and our licensees’ ADC clinical candidates. In this regard, we craft a detailed patent protection strategy for each ADC as it approaches clinical evaluation. Such strategies make use of the patents and patent applications described in the preceding paragraphs, as well as ADC-specific filings, to create a multi-layered and multi-jurisdictional patent protection approach for each ADC as it enters the clinic. These ADC-specific patent strategies are intended to provide the exclusivity basis for revenue and royalties arising from commercial development of each of ImmunoGen’s and our licensees’ ADCs.
 We expect our continued independent and collaborative work in each of these areas will lead to other patent applications. We will be the owner of all patents covering our independently generated inventions. In all other instances, we expect to either be the sole owner or co-owner of any patents covering collaboratively generated inventions insofar as they relate to co-developed products or our ADC platform technology, or otherwise have an exclusive or non-exclusive license to the technology covered by such patents.
 We cannot provide assurance that pending patent applications will issue as patents or that any patents, if issued, will provide us with adequate protection against competitors with respect to the covered products, technologies, or 

 
  12

 
processes. Defining the scope and term of patent protection involves complex legal and factual analyses and, at any given time, the result of such analyses may be uncertain. In addition, other parties may challenge our patents in litigation or administrative proceedings resulting in a partial or complete loss of certain patent rights owned or controlled by ImmunoGen. Furthermore, as a patent does not confer any specific freedom to operate, other parties may have patents that may block or otherwise hinder the development and commercialization of our technology.
 In addition, many of the processes and much of the know‑how that are important to us depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our key scientific and technical personnel, which skills, knowledge and experience are not patentable. To protect our rights in these areas, we require that all employees, consultants, advisors, and collaborators enter into confidentiality agreements with us. Further, we require that all employees enter into assignment of invention agreements as a condition of employment. We cannot provide assurance, however, that these agreements will provide adequate or any meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know‑how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets, know‑how, or proprietary information. Further, in the absence of patent protection, we may be exposed to competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technology or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, know‑how, or other proprietary information.
 Competition
 We focus on highly competitive areas of product development. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical companies and other biotechnology firms. For example, Pfizer, Seattle Genetics, Roche, Astellas, AstraZeneca/MedImmune, and AbbVie have programs to attach a cell‑killing small molecule to an antibody for targeted delivery to cancer cells. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as other institutions, also compete with us for promising targets for antibody‑based therapeutics and in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel. Additionally, there are non‑ADC therapies available and/or in development for the cancer types we and our partners are targeting. Many competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, sales, marketing, and human resources than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.
 In particular, competitive factors within the antibody and cancer therapeutic market include:

· | the safety, efficacy, and convenience of products;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | the timing of regulatory approvals and commercial introductions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | special regulatory designation of products, such as orphan drug designation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the effectiveness of marketing, sales, and reimbursement efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our competitive position depends on a combination of factors.  These include effectively pursuing the development of proprietary products, the implementation of clinical development programs, the ability to appropriately manufacture, sell, and market our products, and obtain patent protection for our products.  In addition, we must secure sufficient capital resources to accomplish all of the previously mentioned activities.   
 Continued development of conventional and targeted chemotherapeutics by large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies may result in new compounds that may compete with our product candidates. Antibodies developed by certain of these companies have been approved for use as cancer therapeutics. In the future, new antibodies or other targeted therapies may compete with our product candidates. Other companies have created or have programs to create potent cell‑killing agents for attachment to antibodies. These companies may compete with us for technology out‑license arrangements.
 Regulatory Matters
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state, and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record‑keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, and export and import of products 

 
  13

 
such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before it may be legally marketed in the U.S.
 U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to adverse administrative or judicial actions. These actions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any such administrative or judicial action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

· | completion of preclinical and other nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies according to current Good Laboratory Practices, or cGLP, or other applicable regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials according to current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | development and approval of a companion diagnostic if the FDA or the sponsor believes that its use is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
--+----------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------

  Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a clinical protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted and clinical trials have begun. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30‑day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about on‑going or proposed clinical trials or non‑compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the sponsor submits additional information that alleviates FDA concerns and FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted.
 Each clinical trial must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements pursuant to a protocol included as part of the IND, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to 

 
  14

 
each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase I: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety and dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life‑threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase II: This phase involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase III: These trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites and to establish the overall risk‑benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Post‑approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional information about the use of the approved drug in the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected or serious patient reactions. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors may request meetings with the FDA. These meetings often occur prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted, but meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the End of Phase II meeting to discuss their Phase II clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III clinical trial or trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. If this type of discussion occurs, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design of the Phase III clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.
 According to FDA guidance for industry on the SPA process, a sponsor that meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a special protocol assessment and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA is required to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began. If the sponsor makes any unilateral changes to the approved protocol, the agreement will be invalidated.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the 

 
  15

 
manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Most sponsors of clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. However, there are evolving rules and increasing requirements for publication of all trial‑related information, and it is possible that data and other information from trials involving drugs that never garner approval could require disclosure in the future.
 Companion Diagnostics
 For some of our product candidates, including mirvetuximab soravtansine and potentially others, we plan to work with collaborators to develop or obtain access to in vitro companion or complementary diagnostic tests to identify appropriate patients for these targeted therapies.
 If a sponsor or the FDA believes that a diagnostic test is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product, a sponsor will typically work with a collaborator to develop an in vitro diagnostic, or IVD. Companion diagnostics can be used to identify patients likely to be more responsive to a particular therapy or at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product. They may also be useful for monitoring the response to treatment for the purpose of adjusting treatment or doses to achieve improved safety or effectiveness.
 IVDs are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, and it issued a final guidance document in 2014, entitled “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices” that is intended to assist companies developing in vitro companion diagnostic devices and companies developing therapeutic products that depend on the use of a specific in vitro companion diagnostic for the safe and effective use of the product. The FDA defined an IVD companion diagnostic device as a device that provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The FDA also issued a draft guidance on July 15, 2016, entitled, “Principles for Codevelopment of an In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Device with a Therapeutic Product” to serve as a practical guide to assist therapeutic product sponsors and IVD sponsors in developing a therapeutic product and an accompanying IVD companion diagnostic.
 The FDA subsequently introduced the concept of complementary diagnostics that are distinct from companion diagnostics because they provide additional information about how a drug is used or identify patients who are likely to derive the greatest benefit from therapy without being required for the safe and effective use of that drug.  The FDA has not yet provided much guidance on the regulation and use of complementary diagnostics, but several have been approved.
 The FDA indicated that it will apply a risk-based approach to determine the regulatory pathway for IVD companion and complementary diagnostic devices, as it does with all medical devices. This means that the regulatory pathway will depend on the level of risk to patients, based on the intended use of the IVD companion diagnostic device and the controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. The two primary types of marketing pathways for medical devices are clearance of a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. We expect that any IVD companion diagnostic device developed for use with our drug candidates will utilize the PMA pathway and that a clinical trial performed under an investigational device exemption, or IDE, will have to be completed before the PMA may be submitted.

 
  16

 

 The FDA expects that the therapeutic sponsor will address the need for an IVD companion diagnostic device in its therapeutic product development plan and that, in most cases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding IVD companion diagnostic device will be developed contemporaneously. If the companion diagnostic test will be used to make critical treatment decisions such as patient selection, treatment assignment, or treatment arm, it will likely be considered a significant risk device for which a clinical trial will be required.
 The sponsor of the IVD companion diagnostic device will be required to comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements that apply to clinical trials of significant risk devices. If the diagnostic test and the therapeutic drug are studied together to support their respective approvals, the clinical trial must meet both the IDE and IND requirements.
 PMAs must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete.
 After approval, the use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product will be stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product. In addition, a diagnostic test that was approved through the PMA process or one that was cleared through the 510(k) process and placed on the market will be subject to many of the same regulatory requirements that apply to approved drugs.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 The results of product development, preclinical and other non‑clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review. FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP‑compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
 NDAs or BLAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. Priority review for an NDA for a new molecular entity and original BLAs will be 6 months from the date that the NDA or BLA is filed. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life‑threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well‑controlled Phase IV clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process.

 
  17

 

 After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional Phase III trial or other significant and time‑consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or other elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non‑compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs, and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data need to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. Orphan indications are exempt from PREA. The FDA must send a non‑compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current, or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments. The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one‑half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 Pediatric exclusivity is a type of marketing exclusivity available in the U.S. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, an additional six months of marketing exclusivity may be available if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA, or a Written Request. If the Written Request does not include clinical trials in neonates, the FDA is required to include its rationale for not requesting those clinical trials. The FDA may request studies on approved or unapproved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance

of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. To date, we have not received any Written Requests.
 Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for two types of “generic” biologics—biosimilars and interchangeable biologic products, and provides for a twelve‑year data exclusivity period for the first approved biological product, or reference product, against which a biosimilar or interchangeable application is evaluated; however if pediatric clinical trials are performed and accepted by the FDA, the twelve‑year data exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months. A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product.
 The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical trials to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity, and potency.
 An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first approved. The first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed, but the exclusivity period may be shortened under certain circumstances.
 The FDA has issued a number of final and draft guidances in order to implement the law and will likely continue to publish new guidances as new issues relating to biosimilars and interchangeability are identified. The guidance documents provide FDA’s current thinking on approaches to demonstrating that a proposed biological product is biosimilar to a reference product. Although the FDA intends to issue additional guidance documents in the future, the absence of final guidance documents covering all biosimilars issues does not prevent a sponsor from seeking licensure of a biosimilar under the BPCIA, as evidenced by the biosimilar products already approved by the FDA.
  Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether a drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of orphan product exclusivity, except in very limited circumstances. The FDA issued a final rule, effective August 12, 2013, intended to clarify several regulatory provisions, among which was a clarification of some of those limited circumstances. One of the provisions makes clear that the FDA will not recognize orphan drug exclusive approval if a sponsor fails to demonstrate upon approval that the drug is clinically superior to a previously approved drug, regardless of whether or not the approved drug was designated an orphan drug or had orphan drug exclusivity. Thus, orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA and we are not able to show the clinical superiority of our drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.

 The FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the European Union granted orphan designation to mirvetuximab soravtansine, or IMGN853, when used for the treatment of ovarian cancer. In the U.S., orphan drug designation provides us with seven years of market exclusivity that begins once mirvetuximab soravtansine receives FDA marketing approval for the use for which the orphan drug status was granted. In the EU, orphan designation will provide us with ten years of market exclusivity that begins after mirvetuximab soravtansine receives marketing authorization for the use for which it was granted. We may pursue these designations for other indications for other product candidates intended for qualifying patient populations.
 Expedited Review and Approval; Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life‑threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre‑BLA or pre‑NDA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Priority review, which is requested at the time of BLA or NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an accelerated approval typically begin early in the development of the drug in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post‑marketing clinical trials to confirm the appropriateness of the surrogate marker trial.
 In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Improvement Act, or FDASIA, Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated approval. The law required the FDA to issue related draft guidance within a year after the law’s enactment and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. The FDA published a final guidance on May 30, 2014, entitled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions—Drugs and Biologics.” One of the expedited programs added by FDASIA is that for Breakthrough Therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). A sponsor may request Breakthrough Therapy designation at the time that the IND is submitted, or no later than at the end‑of‑Phase II meeting. The FDA will respond to a Breakthrough Therapy designation request within sixty days of receipt of the request. A drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation is eligible for all fast track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase I, and commitment from the FDA involving senior managers.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws and regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.

 Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us or our partners pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record‑keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion, and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance, or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. A favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the EMA of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the EMA, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective, or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan‑designated product.
 Reimbursement
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third‑party reimbursement. Third‑party payers include government healthcare programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. We anticipate third‑party payers will provide reimbursement for our products. However, these third‑party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We have incorporated certain health outcomes measures in our clinical studies, but may need to conduct expensive additional pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost‑effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost‑effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third‑party payers. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.

 Medicare is a federal healthcare program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as individuals with certain disabilities. Drugs may be covered under one or more sections of Medicare depending on the nature of the drug and the conditions associated with and site of administration. For example, under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand‑alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
 Medicare Part B covers most injectable drugs given in an in‑patient setting and some drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient departments and doctors’ offices. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage decisions. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for a Part B covered drug based on a percentage of manufacturer‑reported average sales price which is regularly updated. We believe that most of our drugs, when approved, will be subject to the Medicare Part B rules.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for this research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third‑party payers do not consider our products to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, ACA) enacted in March 2010, was expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry and result in expanded coverage for the uninsured. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, ACA was expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the impact of ACA on pharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet occurred. In addition, some members of Congress and the President continue to express their strong desire to repeal the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed, for example, as part of the recently adopted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the U.S. Congress eliminated the ACA’s individual mandate. These challenges add to the uncertainty of the changes enacted as part of ACA. Moreover, President Trump ran for office on a platform that supported the repeal of the ACA and one of his first actions after his inauguration was to sign an Executive Order commanding federal agencies to try to waive or delay requirements of the ACA that impose economic or regulatory burdens on states, families, the health-care industry and others. The Order also declares that the administration will seek the “prompt repeal” of the law and that the government should prepare to “afford the states more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare market.” At this time, the immediate impact of the Order or Congressional actions is not clear. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.

 Research and Development Spending
 During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we spent $174.5, $139.7, $141.3, $66.6, $73.3, and $148.1 million, respectively, on research and development activities. Manufacturing
 We contract with third-party contract manufacturers, or CMOs, for the manufacture of our product candidates for both our clinical and potential commercial needs. Our CMO network manufactures antibody, linker, and payload, conjugates the foregoing to create bulk drug substance of our product candidates, and processes the bulk drug substance into vialed and labeled drug product for use in humans. As a result of the closure of our Norwood facility in 2018, we no longer operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates for clinical use, and we have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. Although we are reliant on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our CMOs.
 CMOs are subject to extensive governmental regulations and we depend on them to manufacture our product candidates in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. We have an established quality assurance program to ensure that the CMOs involved in the manufacture of product candidates do so in accordance with cGMP and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulations. We believe that our current CMO network complies with such regulations.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 296 full‑time employees, of whom 240 were engaged in research and development activities. Of the 240 research and development employees, 148 employees hold post‑graduate degrees, of which 64 hold Ph.D. degrees and eight hold M.D. degrees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 We have entered into confidentiality agreements with all of our employees, members of our board of directors and consultants. Further, we have entered into assignment of invention agreements with all of our employees.
 In February 2018, we determined to implement a new operating model that will rely on external manufacturing and quality testing for drug substance and drug product for our development programs. The implementation of this new operating model led to the ramp-down of manufacturing and quality activities at our Norwood facility during 2018, with a full decommissioning of the facility occurring in early 2019.  Implementation of the new operating model resulted in a net reduction of our workforce by approximately 20 positions.
