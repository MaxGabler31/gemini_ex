Business Overview
 
Ozop Energy Systems
 
On December 11, 2020, the Company formed Ozop Energy Systems, Inc. (“OES”), a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. OES was formed to be a manufacturer and distributor of renewable energy products and is actively engaged in the renewable, electric vehicle (“EV”), energy storage and energy resiliency sectors. OES management has decades of experience in the renewable, storage and resilient energy businesses and associated markets, which include but are not limited to project finance, project development, equipment finance, construction, utility protocol, regulatory policy and technology assessment.
 
We are engaged in multiple business lines that include Project Development as well as Equipment Distribution. Our solar and energy storage projects involve large-scale battery and solar photovoltaics (PV) installations. The utility-scale storage business is based on an arbitrage business model in which we install multiple 1+ megawatt batteries, charge them with off-peak grid electricity under contract with the utility, then sell the power back during peak load hours at a premium, as dictated by prevailing electricity tariffs.
 
Equipment Distributor: OES has entered the component supply/distribution side of the renewable, resiliency and energy storage industries distributing the core components associated with residential and commercial solar PV systems as well as onsite battery storage and power generation. In April 2021, the Company signed a five- year lease (beginning June 1, 2021) of approximately 8,100 SF in California, for office and warehouse space to support the sales and distribution of our west coast operations. The components we are distributing include PV panels, solar inverters, solar mounting systems, stationary batteries, onsite generators and other associated electrical equipment and components that are all manufactured by multiple companies, both domestic and international. These core products are sourced from management-developed relationships and are distributed through our existing network and our in-house sales team. Sales were approximately $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Solar PV: Our PV business model involves the design and construction of electrical generating PV systems that can sell power to the utilities or be used for off grid use as part of our developing Neo-Grids solution. The Neo-Grids proprietary program, patents pending, was developed for the off-grid distribution of electricity to remove or reduce the dependency on utilities that currently burdens the EV Charging sectors. It will also reduce or eliminate the lengthy permitting processes and streamline the installations of those EV chargers.
 
Modular Energy Distribution System: The Neo-Grids, patent pending, is comprised of the design engineering, installation, and operational methodologies as well as the financial arbitrage of how we produce, capture and distribute electrical energy for the EV markets. Neo-Grids will serve both the private auto and the commercial sectors. OES has license rights to the proprietary “flow” that was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in March 2021. The exponential growth of the EV industry has been accelerated by the recent major commitments of most of the major car manufacturers. Our Neo-Grids business model leverages this accelerated growth by offering (1) charging locations that can be installed with reduced delays, restricted areas or load limits and (2) EV charger electricity that is produced from renewable sources claiming little to no carbon footprint.
 
OES has developed a business plan for the Neo Grids distribution solution that is being executed now and will be coming out of Research and Development for proof of concept in Q4 2021. Having identified several manufacturers and established a supply line for EV chargers, we have entered into agreements for EV charger installations as part of this proof of concept and plan to service them under multi-year agreements.
 
Ozop Plus
 
On August 19, 2021, the Company formed Ozop Capital Partners, Inc. (“Ozop Capital”), a Delaware corporation. The Company is the majority shareholder of Ozop Capital. On October 29, 2021, EV Insurance Company, Inc. (“EVCO”) was formed as a captive insurance company in the State of Delaware. EVCO is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ozop Capital (DBA OZOP Plus). Ozop Plus plans on producing vehicle service contracts (“VSC’s”) for electric vehicles (EV’s). to respond to not only in filling the gap of a manufacturer’s warranty but to bring added value to EV owners by utilizing our partnerships and strengths in the renewable energy market to offer unique and innovative services. Among EV owners’ concerns are the EV battery repair and replacement costs, range anxiety, environmental responsibilities, roadside assistance, and the accelerated wear on additional components that EV vehicles experience. Management believes that the Ozop Plus VSC will give “peace of mind” to the EV buyer. The Company is currently in negotiations to complete the necessary agreements to launch the product in Q2 2022. Additionally, the Company is also in discussions with entities whereby Ozop Plus can re-insure the battery portion of another entity’s VSC.
PCTI
 
The following relates to PCTI activity during the year ended December 31, 2021. Due to supply chain issues and other factors, management is currently reviewing the current business model of PCTI, in determining the best course of action going forward.
 
PCTI designs, develops, manufactures and distributes standard and custom power electronic solutions. All of its products are manufactured in the United States.
 
Principal Products and Services
 
PCTI has four main product lines: DC Power Supplies from 5KW to 2MW, Battery chargers from 5KW to 2MW, DC/AC inverters to 1.5MVA and frequency converters up to 1MVA.
 
PCTI historically has manufactured the following product types:
 

● | DC & AC Power Supplies: Our DC power supplies use a multipulse SCR / IGBT design to achieve high efficiency, low ripple, precise regulation and low output noise, available in ratings from 5KW to 2MW.

Microgrids
 
Microgrids are becoming more necessary not just as a way to provide electricity to a remote region but also as a source of resiliency. Whether the entity is critical to society like a hospital, police station or container terminal or needs to maintain revenues by remaining operational (e.g. a manufacturer or food processor), a microgrid provides that unique function. Because PCTI’s inverters and battery chargers are in the highest power segments, they are uniquely suited for microgrid applications.
 
Sales and marketing
 
For legacy products, the Company uses a government contracting service that reviews the daily buying notices from the U.S. government and filters them via keywords specific to the company’s market sectors. Additionally, opportunities come through the U.S. Governments System of Award Management.
 
Competition
 
There are different competitors for each product line that are also further divided by power segment. By serving the high power products sector, we have sought to limit competition and commoditization of our products. We compete as a solution driven company, providing PCTI with what we believe are better margins and larger order values. As we are moving the direction of the company into the renewable energy storage market space, we are aware that some of the competitors have strong brand names. We believe PCTI offers a larger breath of product offering in these power ranges while our competition is fragmented in this area. In the high- power segment, we believe PCTI’s experience, technology and flexibility provides a great advantage over other competitors.
 
We compete with many companies in the various application segments including larger, more established companies with substantial capabilities, personnel and financial resources.
 
PCTI is positioning itself to compete in the high power segment, with a focus on renewable energy and EV markets. These two segments are continuously looking to advance their products, which makes it difficult for the larger companies to adjust. We believe this is how PCTI will have an advantage to compete as a solutions driven company.
 
Many of our competitors have a larger presence in global markets. PCTI is also looking to expend its global footprint.
 
Intellectual Property
 
PCTI has a 30-year design library that includes all four product lines as well as some related equipment. One of our advantages over our competitors is our proprietary digital signal processing (DSP) control currently in its 7th generation. To the best of our knowledge, we believe that none of our competitors are using this sophisticated control topology at this time. DSP control permits great flexibility in our designs, allowing us to produce a wide variety of designs in a shorter period of time than our competitors. DSP allows for real-time control and monitoring of the equipment, which is faster than sequential control. This provides significant performance improvement as well as energy savings in the equipment.
 
PCTI additionally has trade secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture, and testing of the equipment.

Research and Development
 
To maintain our level of continuous innovation, PCTI conducts numerous internal R&D projects. Additionally, the unique needs and applications of our customers require that we conduct R&D and engineering in order to provide them with the needed solutions and products.
Employees
 
As of the date of this filing, the Company employs 21 full time employees. Ozop and PCTI have contracts with various independent contractors and consultants to fulfill additional needs, including accounting, investor relations, business development, permitting, and other corporate functions, and may increase staff further as we expand activities and bring new projects on line.
