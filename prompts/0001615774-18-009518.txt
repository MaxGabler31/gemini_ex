Item 1. | Description of Business.
--------+-------------------------

Overview
 
We are an emerging technology company in China engaged in the development of information technology (or IT) systems and network security solutions. We primarily focus on IT system security and leverage our proprietary technologies, intellectual property and market intelligence to provide comprehensive and optimized security solutions to our clients. We have been certified as one of the High Tech Enterprises (jointly issued by the Beijing Science and Technology Commission, Beijing Finance Bureau, Beijing State Taxation Bureau and Beijing Local Taxation Bureau) and one of the Zhongguancun High Tech Enterprises (issued by the Zhongguancun Science Park Administrative Committee) in recognition of our achievement in high technology products. Our cyber security engineers and experts create, design, build and run various security programs tailored to our clients. Through our professional team and strong expertise in the system security field, we offer our clients a broad portfolio of system security solutions or services, along with strategic advice and ongoing management of their security infrastructure.  
 
We have generated very limited revenues to date, and as such we have been shifting our business focus over the past 12 months from cybersecurity to our “Safe Campus” and “Smart Elevator” security and related marketing solutions as described further below.
 
In order to provide efficient and targeted marketing services, we have independently developed the “Xin Platform,” an online platform that can identify potential customers and market products and services to targeted groups based on the data we collect through our security systems. The Xin Platform also serves as our office to office (or O2O) management platform, which can provide marketing services to traditional merchants such as supermarkets, hotels, shopping malls and restaurants. It also provides support for various other security programs that we develop and/or provide, including our “Safe Campus” security system and “Smart Elevator” security system.
 
Based on the Xin Platform, coupled with the Internet of Things (or IoT) technology and cloud computing, we developed our “Safe Campus” system as an advanced and simple solution to campus security, which has been a rising concern in China. Our “Safe Campus” system consists of student ID card terminals, radio-frequency identification (or RFID readers), campus information management platform, partner management platform and cellphone application terminals, utilizing technologies such as RFID, global positioning system (or GPS), location based services (or LBS), and cloud based calculation.
 
While we have in the past sold and may in the future sell our security solutions as a stand-alone aspect of our business, our current primary business plan anticipates generating most of our revenues from online and offline marketing services, targeted at users of our security solutions in China. For example, users of our “Safe Campus” security system will receive advertisements through our mobile application installed on their smart phones. Advertisements may also be displayed on the hardware of our “Safe Campus” security system, including on the lanyards of our smart student ID cards. Utilizing our security systems and the data collected from users of our security systems and our online platform, we will seek to provide targeted, one stop marketing solutions to businesses.
 
In the elevator security space, our “Smart Elevator” security and management system provides a solution to lower the operation cost of elevators and promote the safety of passengers. The system will include an emergency and rescue terminal and a data collection system. Once installed, our terminals will collect data of the elevator’s operation, regular maintenance services, annual inspections and any malfunctions which enables faster and more efficient error detection and repairs.
 
We also plan to become a national provider of big data processing services in China. We are in the process of developing systems to analyze industry trends, market and customer data, supply chain, financial information, risk detection and management.
 
Recent Developments
 
On March 15, 2018, we entered into a banking service direct sales cooperation agreement (or the Minsheng Agreement) with China Minsheng Banking Corp., Ltd, Tianjin Branch (or Minsheng Bank). Pursuant to the Minsheng Agreement, we will establish a portal on our “Xin Platform” through which the platform users may purchase financial products offered by Minsheng Bank. In consideration, Minsheng Bank will pay us service fees calculated based on the amount of the financial products the platform users purchase and hold. For each specific product, the service fee will be calculated according to the following formula:
 
-1-

 

T-days service fee = annual rate (0.12%) × the amount of the financial products the platform users maintain as of day (T-1) × net value of the financial product ÷ 365
 
The Minsheng Agreement has a term of two years and will be automatically extended one more year if neither party terminates the Minsheng Agreement within the last month of the initial two-year term. 
 
On March 19, 2018, we entered into agency agreements with seven stockholders of our company. Pursuant to the agreement, such stockholders are authorized as agents to market Xin Platform APP in specific areas of China. Each agent is required to pay a Xin Platform APP usage fee of $764 and deposit $764 in financial products offered by China Minsheng Bank via Xin Platform APP. Each agent will receive $8 for each customer that applies for a credit card of China Minsheng Bank via Xin Platform APP.
 
On April 12, 2018, our board of directors and stockholders approved a one-for-three reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, which became effective on May 1, 2018, decreasing the number of outstanding shares from 57,511,771 to 19,170,827.

History 
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 26, 2014 under the name Rose Rock, Inc. On May 26, 2015, we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to Datasea Inc. Up until October 2015, our primary business activities have been providing consulting services to various U.S. companies seeking to do business in China as well as Chinese companies looking to enter the U.S. markets. Nonetheless, we were considered a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Act, as we had no or nominal business operations, employees and/or assets. 
 
On May 26, 2015, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement, Ms. Zhixin Liu purchased 20,000,000 shares, or 57.14%, of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from Mr. Xingzhong Sun, who was our sole officer, director and majority shareholder at the time of the transaction. As part of the transaction, Zhixin Liu was elected as the Chairperson of our Board of Directors (the “Board”). 
 
On October 29, 2015, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Ms. Zhixin Liu and Mr. Fu Liu, the members (“Members”) of Shuhai Information Skill (HK) Limited (“Shuhai Skill (HK)”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC, whereby the Members transferred all of their membership interests of Shuhai Skill (HK) to us in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of our common stock (the transaction, hereinafter referred to as the “Share Exchange”). Upon consummation of the Share Exchange, Shuhai Skill (HK) and its consolidated subsidiaries, Tianjin Information Sea Information Technology Co., Ltd., a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the PRC (“Tianjin Information”), became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Shuahi Information Technology Co., Ltd., also a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the PRC (“Shuhai Beijing”), through its existing contractual relationship with Tianjin Information, became our variable interest entity (“VIE”).

“Safe Campus” Security System
 
Overview
 
We are currently focusing our efforts on the promotion of our Shuhai Smart Campus Safety Management System, or “Safe Campus” security system, which provides a comprehensive campus information platform that is accessible online or via a smartphone application for teachers, students and their families to enhance the communications between them. Our “Safe Campus” users to date have included mostly elementary and middle schools, which are our target markets.
 
 The Safe Campus system consists of both hardware products and service platform, including student ID card terminals RFID readers, campus information management platform, partner management platform and mobile applications on teachers’ and parents’ cellphones, utilizing technologies such as RFID, GPS, LBS, and cloud based calculation. Through our smart student ID cards, schools can manage the profiles of all teachers and students and send campus-wide notifications. They are also able to grant and manage authority of teachers on the school platform. Through our platform, teachers are able to communicate with students via messages and calls; communicate with parents regarding their children; review daily and weekly class schedules; send out assignments and homework to students; notify parents of any class activities; receive notifications from school and any other school activities; and publish online education videos.
 
Through our platform, parents are able to communicate with teachers, locate and track the movement of their children; review class schedules and check-in record of their children; notify teachers/schools of any absence of their children; and review school news and online education videos. Parents can also block unauthorized numbers from reaching their children on their ID cards and set access limits for their children using our smart student ID cards. Our student ID cards automatically alarm parents in the event that their children enter any limited areas or take off their student ID cards. Through the parent terminals, parents can also purchase stationary, toys and food for their children in our online student shopping mall. Students are able to check in and out of school using their ID cards as well as send alarms in case of emergency.
 
Our student ID cards are worn by students every day. In addition, we estimate three mobile application users per student ID card (parents, guardians and other family members) and daily use of our mobile application at least twice a day per mobile application user. Our “Safe Campus” system is expected to generate revenue through advertisement display on student ID cards, all computer terminals and WeChat platform, and eight rotating banner spots reserved for advertisement publishers in our cellphone application. Other than advertisement placement, we also plan to generate revenue through (i) fee arrangements with O2O merchants selling through our online platform to our users; (ii) paid online education services for student users; and (iii) arrangements with financial institutions to offer financial services through our mobile application and terminals.
 
As of June 30, 2018, we had approximately 480,000 users on our cellphone application. We continue marketing our products primarily in key schools in big cities and engaging in negotiations with O2O product and service providers.
 
Campus Security Background and Potential Market
 
On-campus security and the safety of children in general is of great importance and has been increasingly gaining attention in PRC in the recent years. In March 2015, the PRC Office of the Ministry of Public Security and the Office of the Ministry of Education jointly issued Order No. 168, which provides that schools are obligated to ensure the security on campus and in certain circumstances, school administrators can be held responsible for major accidents and subject to administrative penalties or criminal penalties. At the PRC State Conference held on April 12, 2017, the Prime Minister of China emphasized that the measures should be taken to further ensure the security and risk control system on campus, including installation of on campus security systems.

According to the 2016-2022 Security Industry Market Prediction and Investment Strategy Analysis Report published by Prospective Industrial Research Institute, a comprehensive security system for a kindergarten is estimated to cost RMB 50,000 to RMB 200,000 (US$7,500 to US$30,000). Elementary, middle and high schools will cost approximately RMB 500,000 to RMB 1.5 million per school (US$75,000 to US$225,000). Average colleges and universities can cost between RMB 3 million to RMB 5 million (US$450,000 to US$755,000), with certain schools reach over RMB 10 million (US$1,506,000). Based on the number of schools in PRC published by the Ministry of Education in 2016, we believe the potential on-campus security market in China can reach between RMB 35 billion to RMB 230 billion (US$5 to 35 billion).
 
Our “Safe Campus” security system targets elementary and middle schools, which accounts for 85% of the entire campus security market in China and where students are more vulnerable. Our current distribution model prioritizes elementary schools and schools in the urban areas.

To date, the “Safe Campus” security system is still in trial period and has not generated any revenues. We expect our “Safe Campus” security system to generate revenues through advertisements placed on the terminals as well as advertisements displayed on the online platform. We also expect to generate revenues through the O2O shopping mall, other O2O business (including student meal and online education program providers), where we will receive 5% of the revenues for business generated through our platform. We are currently in negotiation with several O2O product and service providers for our platform.
 
“Smart Elevator” Security and Management System
 
With our “Smart Elevator” security and management system, we are aiming to provide a solution to lower the operation cost of elevators and promote the safety of passengers. The system will include an emergency and rescue terminal and a data collection system. Once installed, our terminals will collect data of the elevator operation, regular maintenance services, annual inspections and any malfunctions which enables faster and more efficient error detection and repairs. If any irregular data is detected on a particular elevator by the black box in our terminal, the distant surveillance system will automatically alarm the building and other responsible parties as a means of preventing major accidents. In case of sudden power loss, our system will immediately start the backup power and alarm the maintenance team. Our system can also enable passengers to alarm the building management in case of any emergency and facilitate their communication throughout the entire rescue process.
 
Through our Xin Platform, our “Smart Elevator” system also has the ability to locate the nearest maintenance crew and notify him/her of the emergency through text messages.
 
We plan to launch our “Smart Elevator” system once we complete our testing. We expect to complete testing by the end of 2018 and enter the market in 2019. Once launched, we expect to generate revenue through advertisements displayed on our system on the elevators as well as targeted marketing of elevator maintenance services once any potential safety concern is detected.
 
“Big Data” Processing Services
 
We also aim to become a national provider of big data processing services in China’s education industry. Currently, we are in the process of developing systems to analyze industry trends, market and customer data, supply chain, financial information, risk detection and management. We believe such processing services will be of use to businesses in a wide range of industries. In order to have the technical capacity to provide such services, our research and development process has two phases: data collection and data analysis. Through our “Safe Campus” platform, we obtain raw data on students, parents, teachers and schools. Since 2017, we have focused on collecting data from these platform end users to establish our database. We completed screening and cleaning the data by storing them into various categories based on marketplace needs in June 2018. We are in the process of analyzing the data by using mathematical formulas or algorithms to identify relationships among the variables, such as correlation or causation, and in particular, to investigate the behavioral tendencies of the students, parents, teachers and school administrations. Our goal is by the end of 2018 to have a clean and robust database on students, parents, teachers and schools and to have a deeper plan of collection and application in connection with our “Safe Campus” products. As of the date of this report, we are in the data collection phase.

Cybersecurity System and Equipment
 
We offer cybersecurity solution based on our Xin Platform to provide cybersecurity and online surveillance services by recording activities of the terminal users, including application/software usages and access to certain individualized websites and software. It can also limit access to software and websites of the terminal users. Our cybersecurity system meets the technical standards prescribed by the Ministry of Public Security of the PRC but also aims to satisfy market demands for commercial cybersecurity products. We have developed three types of indoor equipment designed for facilities of different sizes and one type of outdoor equipment primarily for use by local branches of the Ministry of Public Security. In January 2016, we secured a government procurement contract with the Bureau of Public Security of Daqing City in Heilongjiang Province, pursuant to which we installed wireless internet terminal collection equipment and 3G wireless network cards, as well as provided training services related to the use of the equipment. The project was completed and accepted by the customer in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, generating $140,774 of revenue during year ended June 30, 2017. Because of the relatively low profit margin of our cybersecurity program, our business focus has shifted over the past 12 months from cybersecurity systems to our “Safe Campus “and “Smart Elevator” and related marketing programs.  Our management has decided not to actively promote or internally advance our cybersecurity project for the time being. However, we are still maintaining our developed market and our products and may resume marketing activities for our cybersecurity system if market conditions are favorable.

Internet Service Provider Connecting Service
 
We have the technical capacity to provide ISP connecting service and also obtained the Value-Added Telecommunication Business Operating License in August 2015 from the PRC government to provide ISP connecting service. The major target consumers of ISP connecting services are merchants and public institutions that are users of Internet security equipment.
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that our quality control and marketing teams have core management experience in technology programs such as IDC and ISP. Unlike most of the security systems provided by our competitors, our “Safe Campus” security system offers comprehensive logins and user friendly interfaces and allow communication between schools, teachers, parents and students. Our “Smart Elevator” security and management system is in line with the Guidelines on Elevator Emergency Response Platform Development promulgated by the PRC General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine in April 2014.
Growth Strategy 
 
We plan to vigorously market our “Safe Campus” system and “Smart Elevator” systems through different channels such as charities, industry conferences and forums, online platforms and social media such as Weibo and free trials. Our plan anticipates that with the increase in user base of our security solutions, we will generate revenues from advertising placements on our platforms and hardware as well as revenue sharing with other product and service providers utilizing our platforms.
 
Additionally, we hope to become a national provider of big data processing services in the PRC. To this end, we are developing systems to analyze industry trends, market and customer data, supply chain, financial information, risk detection and management. Such processing services can be used by businesses in a wide range of industries. In order to have the technical capacity to provide such service, our research and development process has two phases: data collection and data analysis. As the user base of our security solutions increase, we will have access to more data to support the development of our big data processing service.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development effort is focused on developing new hardware and software and on enhancing and improving our existing products and services. Our engineering team has deep networking and security expertise and works closely with end-customers to identify their current and future needs. We believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customer and improving our competitive position. We test our products thoroughly to certify and ensure their quality and interoperability with third-party hardware and software products.
 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, our research and development expenses were approximately $361,616 and $203,600. We plan to continue to invest in resources to conduct our research and development efforts.

For cost savings purposes, we have outsourced the manufacture of hardware for our “Safe Campus” program to Shenzhen Yanze Technology Co., Ltd. (“Yanze”), a third party located in Guangdong Province. We have entered into three product purchase agreements – one dated September 6, 2016 and two dated April 1, 2017, respectively (collectively the “Yanze Agreement”). Pursuant to the Yanze Agreement, we agreed to purchase 4s electronic student cards, attendance machines and point-of-sale machines. We also agreed to pay 30% of the total price upon the execution of such agreement and another 70% within 10 days upon Yanze’s request when the products are ready. Yanze has the obligation to deliver the products within 30 days upon the receipt of first payment and meet the technical standards set forth by us and offers a warranty of 13 months.
 
Historically, we outsourced the production of Internet security equipment to Shenzhen Shunxin Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shunxin”), a third-party entity in Guangdong Province, China. Shunxin has a permit issued by the Ministry of Public Security for manufacturing Internet security products. We entered into a framework agreement dated October 12, 2015, pursuant to which we authorized Shunxin to use our trademark and logo on its Internet security equipment that meets both the standard issued by the PRC Public Security Bureau and requirements set by us. If the demands for our products increase in the future, we would need to negotiate agreements with new manufacturing contractors or build our own manufacturing facilities to meet increasing customer demands for our equipment. There has been no further substantive action taken by Shunxin or us under such letter of intent.
 
We are exploring corporative opportunities with other manufacturers and may change our suppliers from time to time. 
 
Marketing
 
We currently focus on the marketing of our “Safe Campus” security program. We promote our products and services through both traditional and new media marketing channels. We are partnering with various organizations, including China Council for the Promotion of National Trade, the Next Generation Foundation and other charitable foundations focused on the welfare of children to promote our “Safe Campus” system. We are in the process of establishing a nationwide distribution network consisting of agents in different regions for our “Safe Campus” security system and also plan to utilize social media, online commercials, industry forums and trade conferences to market the “Safe Campus” system. As of the date of this report, we have signed agreements with 30 schools in 10 provinces covering approximately 9,000 students, to use our “Safe Campus” program.
 
In addition, we maintain 12 full-time employees who focus on sales and marketing efforts relating to the promotion of our products and services. The marketing employees arrange for advertising events and prepare corporate literature for distribution to promote our products and services. By leveraging our technological expertise in new media marketing, we also target our potential customers through the social media application WeChat and our own Xin Platform.
 
Customers
 
During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, 85.1% and 100% of our revenue was generated through our historical cybersecurity business under a government procurement contract with the Bureau of Public Security of Daqing City in Heilongjiang Province, China, respectively.
