ITEM 1. BUSINESS    
Portillo’s Inc. (the “Company’) was formed and incorporated as a Delaware corporation on June 8, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of completing a public offering and related reorganization transactions (collectively, the "Transactions”) in order to carry on the business of PHD Group Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries (“Portillo’s OpCo”). Following the consummation of the Transactions on October 20, 2021, the Company became the sole managing member of Portillo’s OpCo, and as sole managing member, the Company operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Portillo's OpCo. As a result, the Company consolidates the financial results of Portillo's OpCo and reports a non-controlling interest representing the economic interest in Portillo's OpCo held by the other members of Portillo's OpCo (the "pre-IPO LLC Members"). Unless the context otherwise requires, references to "we," "us," "our," "Portillo's," the "Company" and other similar references refer to Portillo's Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Portillo’s OpCo.
Initial Public Offering and the Transactions
The Company's registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (Registration No. 333-259810), related to its initial public offering ("IPO") was declared effective October 20, 2021, and the Company's Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") under the symbol "PTLO" on October 21, 2021. On October 25, 2021, the Company completed its IPO of 23,310,810 shares of the Company's Class A common stock (including 3,040,540 shares sold to the underwriters pursuant to their overallotment option) at an offering price of $20.00 per share. The Company received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $430.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $29.1 million and other offering expenses of approximately $7.1 million. 
In connection with the IPO, we completed the following:
•We amended and restated the limited liability company agreement of Portillo’s OpCo to, among other things, convert all outstanding equity interests (except for those redeemable preferred units which were redeemed in connection with the IPO) into LLC Units.
•We became the sole managing member of Portillo's OpCo. Because we manage and operate the business and control the strategic decisions and day-to-day operations of Portillo’s OpCo and because we also have a substantial financial interest in Portillo’s OpCo, we will consolidate the financial results of Portillo’s OpCo, and a portion of our net income will be allocated to non-controlling interests to reflect the entitlement of the pre-IPO LLC Members who retained their equity ownership in Portillo's OpCo. In addition, because Portillo’s OpCo was under the common control of the pre-IPO LLC Members before and after the Transactions, we measured the assets and liabilities of Portillo’s OpCo at their carrying amounts as of the date of the completion of the Transactions.
•We amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to authorize the issuance of two classes of common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitles its holder to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The Class B common stock is not entitled to economic interests in Portillo’s Inc.
See the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements And Supplementary Data" for more information about the above-mentioned transactions as well as the other transactions completed in connection with the IPO. Following the completion of the Transactions, Portillo's Inc. owns 50.1% of Portillo’s OpCo. The pre-IPO LLC Members own the remaining 49.9% of Portillo’s OpCo. 
Overview of Portillo's
Portillo’s serves iconic Chicago street food through high-energy, multichannel restaurants designed to ignite the senses and create a memorable dining experience. Since our founding in 1963 in a small trailer which Dick Portillo called “The Dog House,” we have grown to become a treasured brand with a passionate (some might say obsessed) nationwide following. Our diverse menu features all-American favorites such as Chicago-style hot dogs and sausages, Italian beef sandwiches, char-grilled burgers, chopped salads, crinkle-cut french fries, homemade chocolate cake and signature chocolate cake shake. We create a consumer experience like no other by combining the best attributes of fast casual and quick service concepts with an exciting energy-filled atmosphere and restaurant model capable of generating tremendous volumes. Nearly all of our restaurants were built with double lane drive-thrus and have been thoughtfully designed with a layout that accommodates a variety of access modes including dine-in, carryout, delivery and catering in order to quickly and efficiently serve our guests. No matter how our guests order from us, our highly productive kitchens and team members consistently serve high-quality food and deliver a memorable guest experience. We believe the combination of our craveable food, multichannel sales model, dedication to operational excellence, and a distinctive culture driven by our team members gives us a competitive advantage. 
As of December 26, 2021, we owned and operated 69 restaurants across nine states, including a restaurant owned by C&O Chicago, L.L.C. ("C&O") of which we own 50% of the equity. 
Our Story 
We relish the opportunity to create lifelong memories by igniting the senses with unrivaled food and experiences.
An Iconic and Beloved Brand with Obsessed, Lifelong Fans. We capture the hearts, minds and stomachs of our guests with every meal. Our menu features something for everyone and appeals to a broad demographic that enables our restaurants to thrive across diverse trade areas and generate strong and balanced volumes across multiple dayparts, weekdays and occasions. Our new restaurant openings draw massive crowds of passionate fans who line up overnight with lines stretching around the block. 
No matter the location, our fans are bun-believably obsessed! Guests cake shake their way in for our Chicago-style hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, char-grilled burgers, cheese fries, fresh salads and famous chocolate cake. But it's not just our menu that sets us apart.
Energetic Restaurant Atmosphere that Engages the Senses. While our operating model is focused on getting delicious, made-to-order food to our guests quickly, our atmosphere makes the experience even more than a delicious meal. When guests walk into a Portillo’s, they get an experience completely different than a typical chain restaurant visit. Our restaurants engage all the senses to create a fun, relaxed and memorable occasion.
Our dining areas evoke nostalgia and local influences. No two Portillo’s are alike. Each of our restaurants has its own themed décor ranging from a 1930’s prohibition motif to a 1950’s jukebox, to a 1960’s hippie bus. The period music ties to the theme, from ragtime to doo wop to disco. No detail is too small, be it lighting, signage or even the stars subtly sparkling on the ceiling. Each restaurant also draws design elements from the community. The layouts create spaces comfortable for individual diners, families, large groups, and even wedding parties.
Beyond the space itself, the energy of a Portillo’s is unique. Our guests can see into our huge, open kitchens, where their meals are prepared right before their eyes. The smells of burgers broiling, french fries frying, and beef simmering emanate from the kitchen. Each completed meal is announced with a fun rhyme (“Number two, we got you”; “Number seven, welcome to Portillo’s heaven”). But the most important element of the energy is the enthusiasm of the scores of guests who are all excited to be there and enjoying their Portillo’s. We want every guest that visits to leave with a memorable experience, a satiated appetite and a desire to return.
Our Food
Our menu offers something for everyone. We obsess over each and every ingredient and curate our menu to ensure that each item receives high marks from our guests and meets our rigorous quality standards. We're known for our famous Chicago-style hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, chopped salad, cheese fries, homemade chocolate cake, and chocolate cake shake. Our Italian beef is slow-roasted for four hours, thinly sliced, and served on freshly baked French bread. Then, it's dipped in hot gravy made with our homemade blend of seasonings that we've been perfecting for 50 years. Our Chicago-style hot dogs feature mustard, relish, freshly chopped onion, sliced red ripe tomatoes, a kosher pickle and sport peppers piled high onto a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun, all finished with a few shakes of savory celery salt. Guests also love our craveable crinkle-cut french fries that are cooked in beef tallow resulting in a perfectly salted, crispy outside with a soft inside. Lastly, for those craving something sweet, our famous homemade fluffy chocolate cakes are baked with love each morning in every restaurant and generously iced with rich chocolate frosting.
Commitment to Quality. Our food is prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients, and our commitment to quality is brought to light by every item on the menu. We obsess over each and every ingredient and recipe to ensure our food is high quality, consistently prepared and tastes great. We have been perfecting our menu for over 50 years, and we are constantly seeking ways to further enhance the quality and selection of our offerings.
Our Menu. Our menu features unrivaled Chicago-style street food and all-American favorites. With something for everyone, our expansive menu creates a “veto-proof” proposition and drives a broad set of consumer occasions.
Menu Innovation. Our primary strategy for menu innovation is to drive traffic through truly craveable foods that can be made with a Portillo’s spin. New menu items are introduced when we believe they will offer superior guest satisfaction and typically coincide with the removal of an existing menu item to ensure a manageable menu size, so that our team members can maintain the operational efficiency that enables our high volumes and consistently high quality offerings.
Our Sales Channels
Our restaurants are thoughtfully designed for both their variety of access modes and the overall guest experience.
Drive-Thru - Our restaurants are built with double lane drive-thrus staffed with engaging attendants that ensure a pleasant and efficient experience with all food made to order. In February 2022, we opened our first off-premise only restaurant, located in Joliet, Illinois, featuring three drive-thru lanes, including one specifically for pickup of advanced orders placed on our app or website, and a pick-up area inside the restaurant for third-party delivery drivers.
Dine-In - Our restaurant dining rooms are elaborately decorated with timeless, nostalgic designs inspired by the local community. Our dining areas feature a variety of flexible seating arrangements designed to accommodate single diners, couples, families and large groups. Guests dining in our restaurants wait in an ordering line to place their order and walk up to a designated pick up area when their order is called.
Carryout - Guests placing a carryout order by phone, online or through our app have the option to walk into the restaurant to pick up their order at our service counter.
Delivery - We have established partnerships with multiple third-party delivery providers and have added self-delivery capability to fulfill larger orders through our team members. 
Catering Offerings - Our catering offerings include buffet-style packages of our ready-to-eat favorites like Italian beef, sausages and meatballs, gourmet salads, pastas and whole cakes. We also sell “Take & Make” offerings – a series of catering items and packages designed for convenient, at-home preparation by our guests. For impromptu gatherings we offer “Fast Packs,” which are convenient packages of eight of our most popular sandwiches, prewrapped and ready to top, which can be prepared and delivered quickly.
Direct Shipping Offerings - Our direct shipping offerings include some of our most popular menu items, including Italian beef (8 sandwich or 20 sandwich pack), Chicago-Style Hot Dogs (10 or 50 pack), sausages, chocolate cake and tamales. 
Our Growth Strategies
Expand Our Restaurant Base. We are in the early stages of our nationwide growth with 69 locations across nine states as of December 26, 2021. Since 2015, we have opened new restaurants at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 9.1%. Over the long term, we plan
to increase our number of restaurants by approximately 10%. Our near-term restaurant growth strategy is focused on leveraging our proven unit economic model primarily in adjacent and national markets outside Chicagoland with favorable macro-economic tailwinds where we already have a presence. We will also add select new restaurants in the Chicagoland market.
Increase Our Same-Restaurant Sales. We aim to continue delivering an outstanding value proposition to our guests and enhance our experience to grow our volumes. We believe the following initiatives will drive same-restaurant sales growth.
•Deliver a Consistently Outstanding Guest Experience. Our relentless focus on operational excellence enables us to drive significant throughput in our restaurants, provide a one-of-a-kind experience and a compelling everyday value proposition to our guests and thereby drive increased customer trial and frequency.
•Purposeful Menu Enhancements. We are constantly studying ways to further enhance our existing offerings while thoughtfully adding new high-quality items. We are also disciplined in maintaining the number of options on our menu. When a new item earns its way onto our menu, we often replace an existing item to maintain our operational efficiency. We believe this purposeful enhancement drives increased guest frequency and reinforces our everyday value proposition that is key to our success.
•Increase Brand Awareness Through Non-Traditional and Social Marketing. We do not rely on mass media advertising or promotion to drive traffic to our restaurants. We actively engage our fans and guests through a dynamic social media effort that includes email, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and other platforms. Our social media activity generates significant engagement with our guests and provides our most passionate fans an opportunity to share their enthusiasm with their followers. 
•Enhance Our Off-Premises Guest Experience. We have always been committed to providing our guests with our delicious food however and whenever they want it. In February 2022, we opened our first off-premise only restaurant, located in Joliet, Illinois, featuring three drive-thru lanes, including one specifically for pickup of advanced orders placed on our app or website, and a pick-up area inside the restaurant for third-party delivery drivers.
Leverage Our Infrastructure to Drive Profitability. Our attractive business model generates strong operating margins and cash flow. We constantly focus on restaurant-level operations while ensuring that we do not sacrifice the quality and experience for which we are known. Our strong average unit volumes and operational focus give us the ability to manage variable costs and leverage our fixed costs. We believe we will continue to grow revenue and system-wide profitability by executing our growth strategy and leveraging the experience of our existing general managers to lead our new restaurants to drive successful and efficient new openings. Our investments to enhance our multichannel capabilities and drive a frictionless guest order experience are also expected to further leverage our fixed costs. We have made significant investments at the corporate level, which we believe we will leverage in the future, exclusive of the additional costs of operating as a public company.
Our Team - Human Capital Management 
Our team member base, as of December 26, 2021, consisted of 7,453 team members. This included 155 Restaurant Support Center (“RSC”) team members and 267 restaurant managers and above restaurant leaders, with the remainder being hourly team members. Our team members are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. Our executive officers have more than 140 years of experience in the restaurant industry.
Values-Driven, People-Centered Culture. In February 2021, we were named one of Forbes Top Midsize Employers to work for. We believe this is attributed to our conviction that our People are the Heart of Portillo’s. We hire and train great people who can turn their obsession for our brand into a profession. Our team members are passionate about our food, love our guests, and call their teammates “family.” And that family is both diverse and inclusive. We strive to foster a sense of individuality, safety, support, belonging and fairness through inclusive practices in talent acquisition, talent management, total rewards and learning and development such as career pathing and unconscious bias training.
This people-centric culture is centered on working together to create a fun, energetic atmosphere while living our values:
“Family” – We work together to make everyone feel at home, and we step up when someone needs help
“Greatness” – We are obsessed with being the best and work hard to continuously improve. Our greatness is rooted in Quality, Service, Attitude and Cleanliness (“QSAC”)
“Energy” – We move with urgency and passion, while maintaining attention to detail
“Fun” – We entertain our guests, we connect authentically, and we make each other smile
These values extend beyond our restaurants, to every team member. For example, during the holiday season, our RSC team members lived our value of family by volunteering to work shifts in the restaurants. This connected our RSC team members to our restaurants as well as provided hands-on perspective on how they can better support the restaurants in their daily responsibilities.
Living these values enforces the culture we’re proud of. It’s why we are passionate about attracting and selecting team members who are aligned with our purpose and values, as well as why we established an employee value proposition centered around culture. It’s also why our team members are our best ambassadors and why we’ve seen success with our referral program. Our culture results in top quartile industry retention for management and hourly team members. 
Leadership Development. We provide a full spectrum of resources, from skill building to leadership development, at every level in the organization. Our philosophy is to develop people to be ready before a position is open, as opposed to waiting for a position to be open and then training them. We view this investment as fundamental to our growth, building a pipeline of leaders for our future. In 2021, more than 80% of our leadership openings were filled internally. 
We are committed to continuing education and providing ways for individuals to build their talents. We hold quarterly career interest days, we work with team members and managers to build individual development plans with training and experiences, we hold regularly scheduled development programs throughout the year for each level of leadership, we created a training lead program to provide a dedicated team member in each restaurant to oversee station and new initiative training, and we hold bi-annual talent and succession planning to identify and support individuals with career pathing and development opportunities. 
Engagement & Experience. We believe in our team members having a voice to share their ideas, feedback and contribute to organizational success. In 2021, we partnered with Gallup to implement our EverEngaged survey to gather, listen to and act on the team members’ feedback. Our engagement results for our multi-unit and general managers were in the top quartile scores. Our team members reflected that they know what is expected of them at work and strongly agree they have what they need to do their jobs right. These are both foundational to an individual’s engagement and success. We will conduct this survey annually to measure improvement and areas of focus. In addition to the survey, we regularly hold roundtable discussions with team members and stay interviews with leaders to gain insights into ways we cultivate an energizing, collaborative work environment. 
We have also prioritized a flexible work environment, addressing work-life flexibility and balance across our different workplaces. We piloted a new scheduling system that allows our hourly team members to align their work schedule with their personal schedule, as well as submit schedules, trade shifts and submit all time-off requests in an easier way. To improve work-life flexibility for managers, we’re also testing shift leaders closing restaurants. For our RSC, we provide the option to work remote or at the office based on personal preference and business needs. Quarterly, we hold engagement-focused RSC culture weeks to bring the team together for connecting, recognition and development. 
Total Rewards. Early in 2021, we conducted a Total Rewards survey to understand team member preferences. The physical, financial, and mental well-being of our team members remains our top priority, and we continue to invest in their success. We believe in a total rewards philosophy of providing top quartile pay in our restaurants, especially across our leadership positions. We conducted an independent pay equity analysis of our U.S. workforce to identify risks and pay gaps in our organization by gender and race/ethnicity. The results did not identify preferential treatment to any class of team members, which supports our commitment to ensuring we pay our team members equally across gender and race/ethnicity. 
This commitment is evidenced by our investment in our compensation packages and robust suite of benefit offerings. In 2021, we improved our paid time off program, made our medical health care program more affordable for hourly team members, added extra hourly pay on key holidays, and implemented a Daily Pay option for team members to access their pay when needed. To prioritize overall well-being, we also added a wellness platform that provides access to fitness and wellness programs and offer personalized mental health assistance through our medical plan. 
At the time of our IPO, in recognition of the team's hard work, we issued Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) to each manager and RSC team member employed on the day of the IPO. We will continue this practice for our General Managers on an annual basis to continue to provide our team with opportunities to own our shares and support retention of key team members, with the next RSU grant to be issued in 2023. We also celebrate team members who have been with Portillo’s ten plus years by awarding a celebratory $100 bonus.
Impact of COVID-19. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized the health and safety of our team members who in turn helped our business not only survive but thrive. We continue to support our team members with a concierge-style service of a centralized “Wellness Team” to advise on and monitor the well-being of our teams. We also continue to fund our foundation called “The Heart of Portillo’s Fund” to support team members who have fallen on hard times due to unexpected circumstances, with more than 40 grants provided in 2021 alone.
Our Sourcing and Supply Chain
We are committed to maintaining our high-quality food standards which depends on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other supplies that meet our demanding specifications from suppliers. We partner with a variety of companies that are similarly aligned with producing and providing high quality products. We are always looking for the best way to provide high-quality food at an incredible everyday value.
Our supply chain approach is based on alignment with key strategic partners that are identified through a comprehensive evaluation process to ensure our standards and expectations are met on a continual basis. This platform affords our organization the opportunity for real time performance assessments to identify any potential gaps and implement corrective measures where required. Robust contingency platforms are reviewed and updated on a regular basis to provide assured supply of products and services for the organization. Through a risk assessment strategy, the supply chain team will identify areas critical to supporting the restaurants and any necessary adjustments or alternate programs are undertaken. 
Supplier and distribution partners are managed under both a code of conduct and a pricing protocol that provides transparent insight to costing mechanisms. In addition, we engage directly with manufacturers to ensure compliance with negotiated contract pricing and requisite volume expectations. Our distribution network is comprised of several independently operated partners aligned under the UniPro umbrella, the largest food service distribution cooperative in the United States. This strategy affords us the opportunity to align with right sized organizations that are dedicated to us and allows us to leverage volume and scale for a competitive advantage and exceptional customer service. 
We operate two commissaries that we leverage to supply our network of restaurants with several of our most iconic products and ensure product consistency and quality. Our commissaries produce our signature beef, peppers and gravy for our Italian beef sandwiches. The prepared ingredients are shipped to our restaurants where our team members will finish the preparation in our kitchens to serve our guests the food they love. Our commissaries also fulfill orders for our direct shipping business, which enables us to deliver our delectable food to our fans all over the country.
Quality and food safety are paramount to protecting our brand and are treated with the utmost priority. Our supplier and distribution partners participate in third party audits to ensure all applicable quality system expectations are being met and our commissaries undergo Silliker auditing. In addition, we employ dedicated team members focused on the food safety portion within our restaurants.
Our Competition
We compete in the highly competitive and fragmented restaurant industry. We compete primarily with quick service and fast casual concepts, and to a lesser extent, full-service restaurants. The number, size and strength of competitors vary by region. Our competition in these segments includes a variety of small locally owned restaurants, medium-sized regional restaurant concepts, and larger national restaurant concepts that provide some combination of dine-in, carry-out, drive thru and delivery services to their guests. We believe competition with these restaurants is based primarily on food quality, taste, ambiance, convenience, service speed, price, and value.
Our Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property includes our trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (including Portillo’s ® and other names used by our restaurants), the trade dress of our restaurants, our websites and domain names (including our website at portillos.com and other websites and domain names used by our restaurants) and other unregistered intellectual property.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
Regulation and Compliance
We are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulation, including those relating to, among others, public health and safety, nutritional content labeling, zoning and fire codes, environmental protection, and employment regulations. Failure to obtain or retain food or other licenses and registrations or exemptions would adversely affect the operations of restaurants. Although we have not experienced and do not anticipate any significant problems in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining such licenses, permits, registrations, exemptions, or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a restaurant in a particular area. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in frequently revised state and local government regulations affecting our business beginning in March 2020. Such regulations govern, for example, employee leave, opening and closing of restaurants and dining rooms, sanitation practices, guest spacing within dining rooms and other social distancing practices and personal protective equipment.
The development of additional restaurants will be subject to compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to zoning, land use, water quality and retention, and environment. We believe federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on operations, but more stringent and varied requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors, among others, could delay construction and increase development costs for new restaurants.
We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and various federal, state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages, exempt versus non-exempt, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements and other working conditions. As a result of wage pressures, our team members are all paid more than the applicable minimum wage in the area where they work, and increases in federal or state minimum wages or unemployment benefits may result in increases in the wage rates paid. We are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment, which may require us to design or modify our restaurants to make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons.
For a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors." 
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in that our revenues are typically nominally higher during the second, third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year. Our quarterly results have been and will continue to be affected by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated pre-opening expenses. As a result of these factors, our financial results for any single quarter or for periods of less than a year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
