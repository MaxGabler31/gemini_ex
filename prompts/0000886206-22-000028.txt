ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General Information

Franklin Covey is a global company focused on organizational performance improvement. Our mission is to “enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere,” and our global structure is designed to help individuals and organizations achieve results that require collective behavior change. From the foundational work of Dr. Stephen R. Covey in leadership and personal effectiveness, and Hyrum W. Smith in productivity and time management, we have developed deep expertise that extends to helping organizations and individuals achieve desired results through lasting behavioral change. We believe that our clients are able to utilize our content and offerings to create cultures which include high-performing, collaborative individuals, led by effective, trust building leaders who execute with excellence and deliver measurably improved results for all of their key stakeholders.

The Company was incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the state of Utah, and we merged with the Covey Leadership Center in 1997 to form Franklin Covey Co. Our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 totaled $262.8 million and our shares of common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “FC.”

Our fiscal year ends on August 31 of each year. Unless otherwise noted, references to fiscal years apply to the 12 months ended August 31 of the specified year.

The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 2200 West Parkway Boulevard, Salt Lake City, Utah 84119-2331, and our telephone number is (801) 817-1776. Our website is www.franklincovey.com.

Franklin Covey Services and Offerings

Our mission is to “enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere,” and we believe that we are experts at solving certain pervasive, intractable problems, each of which requires a change in human behavior. Our services and products are designed to help our clients succeed in four key areas:

1.Develop exceptional leaders at every level.
2.Instill habits of effectiveness in every individual.
3.Build an inclusive, high-trust culture.
4.Use a common execution framework to pursue their most important goals.

We believe that when organizations partner with us, their people change behavior—both individually and collectively—in ways that help solve an organization’s most pressing problems and achieve breakthrough results. Lasting behavior change begins with individuals from the inside out, with how people see themselves and the world around them. These insights translate into how individuals engage and lead others. Our content, which is based on timeless principles of human effectiveness, is designed to help people change both their mindset and behavior.

We seek to combine the best content, people, and technology to help our clients achieve results at scale—across an entire organization. We believe the combination of powerful content, teams of experts, a dynamic behavior change platform, and key metrics can guide leaders and teams through impact journeys that deliver exceptional results again and again.

Our services and products are primarily delivered through our subscription offerings, which are comprised of the All Access Pass (AAP), which is primarily sold through our Enterprise Division, and the Leader in Me membership, which is designed specifically for our Education Division. We believe the AAP is a revolutionary and innovative way to deliver our content to clients of various sizes, including large, multinational organizations, in a flexible and cost-effective manner. Clients may utilize complete offerings such as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The Four Disciplines of Execution, and The 5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity, or use individual concepts from any of our well-known offerings to create a custom solution to fit their organizational or individual training needs. Since the introduction of the All Access Pass, we have developed the role of Implementation Specialists to provide our clients with the direction necessary to create meaningful impact journeys using our tools and content. An impact journey is a customized plan to utilize the content and offerings on the AAP to achieve a client’s specific goals and to provide them with the keys to obtain maximum value from the pass. We have also translated AAP materials into numerous additional languages, which allows the AAP to be used effectively by multinational entities and provides for greater international sales opportunities.

In our Education Division, we offer the Leader in Me membership, which provides access to the Leader in Me online service, and authorizes use of Franklin Covey’s proprietary intellectual property. The Leader in Me online service provides access to digital versions of student leadership guides, leadership lessons, illustrated leadership stories, and a variety of other resources to enable an educational institution to effectively implement and utilize the Leader in Me program. We believe that the tools and resources available through the Leader in Me membership will provide measurable results that are designed to develop student leadership, improve school culture, and increase academic proficiency.

To deliver these services and products, we operate globally with one common brand and a business model designed to enable us to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service. To achieve this high level of service we have sales and support associates in various locations around the United States and Canada, and operate wholly owned subsidiaries in Australia, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. In foreign locations where we do not have a directly owned office, we may contract with independent licensee partners who deliver our content and provide services in 150 other countries and territories around the world.

Further information about our content and services can be found on our website at www.franklincovey.com. However, the information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute any part of this Annual Report.

Business Development

Our business is currently structured around two divisions, the Enterprise Division and the Education Division. The Enterprise Division consists of our Direct Office and International Licensee segments and is focused on selling our offerings to corporations, governments, not-for-profits, and other related organizations. Franklin Covey offerings delivered through the Enterprise Division are designed to help organizations and individuals achieve their own great purposes through behavior changing content and coaching. Our Education Division is centered around the principles found in the Leader in Me and is dedicated to helping educational institutions build cultures that will produce great results, including increased student performance, improved school culture, and increased parental and teacher involvement.

Following the launch of our AAP subscription service and Leader in Me membership, we have consistently sought to improve the technology, content, and overall client experience with these offerings. Bob Whitman, our former Chief Executive Officer and current Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors described our commitment to continued development as, “We don’t want to fall in love with our current solutions, we want to ‘fall in love with problems’ and keep working to find solutions that help people make real progress.” We believe that continued investments in technology, content, and personnel are key to subscription service renewals and the future growth of our offerings.

In addition to the internal development of our offerings, we have on occasion sought to grow our sales through acquisitions of businesses and content licenses, and opening new international offices. Over the past few years, our growth investment efforts have included the following:

Acquisition of Strive Talent, Inc. – In April 2021 we purchased Strive Talent, Inc. (Strive), a San Francisco-based technology company which has developed and markets an innovative learning deployment platform. The Strive platform is expected to enable the seamless integration and deployment of our content, services, technology, and metrics to deliver behavioral impact at scale, primarily through the Company’s AAP subscription. We are excited to fully roll out the new capabilities of the Strive platform in early fiscal 2023 and believe the new Impact Platform will provide significant additional value to our clients and appeal to potential new clients.

Investment in New Client Partners – On August 31, 2018, we had 214 client partners. Despite the recent employment turmoil during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing recovery, we have increased the number of client partners to 300 at August 31, 2022. We expect to hire additional sales professionals in fiscal 2023 and future periods to provide additional growth opportunities.

We seek to consistently deliver world-class content with the broadest and deepest distribution capabilities through the most flexible content delivery modalities and expect to make additional investments in technology, content, and personnel in fiscal 2023 and in future periods as market conditions allow. These investments may include business acquisitions, the acquisition of license rights, and hiring additional personnel.

Our Associates

We have approximately 1,150 associates worldwide, who are mostly full-time employees. We also utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. None of our associates are represented by a union or collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a material labor interruption due to labor disagreements. For more information regarding our associates refer to the Human Capital Resources disclosures found later in this section.
Our Industry and Clients

According to the Training magazine 2022 Training Industry Survey, the total size of the U.S. training industry is expected to increase 10 percent over 2021 and is estimated to be $101.6 billion. As such, we believe that there is ample room for growth and increased market share within our industry. Overall, the training industry is highly fragmented and includes a wide variety of training and service providers of varying sizes. We believe our competitive advantages in this industry 

 


stem from our fully integrated principle-centered training offerings, our wide variety of delivery options, and various implementation tools to help organizations and individuals measurably improve their effectiveness.

The training industry is a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and we compete with a variety of organizations of assorted sizes that offer services comparable with ours. Based upon our annual sales, we believe that we are a significant competitor in the performance skills and education market. Other significant comparative companies that compete with our Enterprise Division include: LinkedIn Learning, Development Dimension International, SkillSoft, Coursera, Udemy Business, Harvard Business Publishing, Cornerstone, Workboard, and Korn Ferry, among others. Our Education Division competes with entities such as: Second Step, Avid, Responsive Classroom, Panorama Education, and 7 Mindsets.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industry in which we compete include the following:

Quality of offerings, services, and solutions
Skills and capabilities of people who develop and deliver our content
Innovative training and consulting services combined with effective technology and products
Ability to add value to client operations
Reputation and client references
Pricing
Global reach and scale
Branding and name recognition in our marketplace

Given the relative ease of entry into the training market, the number of our competitors could increase, many of whom may imitate existing methods of distribution, or could offer similar content and programs at lower prices. However, we believe that we have several areas of competitive differentiation in our industry. We believe that our competitive advantages include: (1) the quality of our content; (2) the breadth of our delivery options, including the AAP and Leader in Me membership; (3) our global reach, which allows truly multinational clients to scale our content uniformly across the globe; and (4) the significant impact which our offerings can have on our clients’ organization and results.

We have a relatively broad base of clients, which includes thousands of organizational, governmental, educational, and individual clients in both the United States and in other countries that are served through our directly owned operations. We have thousands of additional organizational clients throughout the world which are served through our global licensee partner network, and we believe that our content, in all its forms, delivers results that encourage strong client loyalty. Our clients are in a broad array of industries and we are not dependent on a single client or industry group. During the periods presented in this report, none of our clients were responsible for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues.

Our Intellectual Property

Our success has resulted in part from our proprietary content, methodologies, and other intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements. We claim rights for over 660 trademarks in the United States and foreign countries, and we have obtained registration in the United States and numerous foreign countries for many of our trademarks including FranklinCovey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The 4 Disciplines of Execution, and The 7 Habits. We consider our trademarks and other proprietary rights to be important and material to our business and we regularly review the status of our trademarks and renew them to prevent the trademark protection from lapsing.

We claim nearly 235 registered copyrights, and own sole or joint copyrights on our books, manuals, text and other printed information provided in our training programs, and other electronic media products, including audio and video media. We may license, rather than sell, facilitator workbooks and other seminar and training materials in order to protect our intellectual property rights therein. We place trademark and copyright notices on our instructional, marketing, and advertising materials. In order to maintain the proprietary nature of our product information, we enter into written 

 


confidentiality agreements with certain executives, product developers, sales professionals, training consultants, other employees, and licensees.

Our Products and Sustainability

We offer training materials and related accessories in either digital or paper formats. Our printed training materials are primarily comprised of paper, which we believe is a renewable and sustainable resource. We purchase our training materials and related products from various vendors and suppliers located both domestically and internationally, and we are not dependent upon any one vendor for the production of our training and related materials as the raw materials for these products are readily available. Our training materials are primarily warehoused and distributed from an independent warehouse facility located in Des Moines, Iowa.
Seasonality

Our fourth quarter of each fiscal year typically has higher sales and operating income than other fiscal quarters primarily due to increased revenues in our Education Division (when school administrators and faculty have professional development days) and to increased sales that typically occur during that quarter from year-end incentive programs. Overall, training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training, which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and certain vacation periods.
Human Capital Resources

A Culture of Belonging at Franklin Covey

Our mission is to “enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere,” which is also the cornerstone of our culture. To fulfill that mission and successfully implement our strategy, we must attract, develop, and retain highly qualified associates for each role in the organization. We currently have approximately 1,150 associates worldwide dedicated to providing the best service possible for our clients and for each other. Our goal is to have every associate feel they are a valued member of a winning team doing meaningful work in an environment of trust. To accomplish this ideal outcome, we are continuously focused on attracting, developing, and retaining talent while looking through the lens of diversity, equity, and inclusion in each area.
Providing Focus and Accountability

We have historically attracted "mission-driven" people who care deeply about making a difference in the world. Our approaches to ensure accountability and responsibility to our mission and culture are shared by all of us and are further fortified through our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Core Council, the Director of Learning, Development, and Inclusion, and the Manager of Diversity Partnerships.

The purpose of the DEI Core Council is to provide input, insight, feedback, and guidance on our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity commitments and initiatives as we strive to enhance our intent of being the workplace of choice for achievers with heart. This multi-disciplinary council is comprised of approximately 35 associates from across our organization. During fiscal 2022, the DEI Core Council focused on hiring and promotion opportunities, and building cultural competence.

The role of Director of Learning, Development, and Inclusion is accountable for the internal learning and development of our associates in ways that align with our strategic plans for growth through the multi-dimensional lens of inclusion. In fiscal 2022, we grew the Mentorship and Employee Resource programs and evaluated our Contribution Conversations program for effectiveness. We also worked to align our Human Resource Information System and Learning Management Systems (LMS), and to support the professional development of our internal LMS stakeholder groups.

‎




Attracting Talent

Our recruiting and hiring efforts cast a wide net when looking for candidates by partnering with many groups and agencies, including alumni organizations, multiple diversity job boards, diversity career fairs, the Utah Governor’s Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities and Business Relations, and ElevatHER – an organization designed to promote women in leadership. 

We remain steadfast in our commitment to recruiting and developing underinvested and underrepresented groups of employees. Women currently constitute 67 percent of our workforce, while the number of women in leadership grew to 44 percent. Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) associates currently comprise 19 percent of our workforce, which represents growth of more than five percent over the prior year. We continue to make efforts to increase the representation of BIPOC, veterans, women, and individuals with disabilities in our workforce while ensuring that our associate promotions are fair and equitable.

Developing Talent

We believe that building an environment that encourages lifelong learning and development is essential for us to maintain a high level of service and to achieve our goal of having every associate feel they are a valued member of a winning team doing meaningful work in an environment of trust. We believe Franklin Covey is one of the world’s premier training and consulting organizations. We develop and deliver various offerings, including leadership and individual effectiveness, to clients around the globe, and we provide these same world-class offerings to our associates. During an associate’s first year, they complete a three-part Company culture orientation, including our 7 Habits of Highly Effective People offering, which is the cultural operating system for our organization. Our associates have unlimited access to our content and training through the AAP, where they can experience the exact high-quality solutions available to our clients.

If an associate struggles with reaching their goals or producing the results required of the role, a thoughtful and thorough performance plan is created and implemented by the associate's manager and our Chief People Officer. The performance plan is designed to help the associate recalibrate and bring performance up to expectations. Through this transparent coaching process, struggling associates can learn how to improve their performance and become engaged, successful contributors in their roles. We believe this process strengthens our associate base while reducing the cost of finding and training new associates.

Retaining Talent

Talented people are always in high demand, and even more so when talent searches align their purpose and values with the organizations and teams they work for and with. From June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2022, our associate turnover rate in the United States and Canada was 17 percent, which we believe is reasonable for our industry and the make-up of our workforce, especially considering the impact of the “great resignation,” which has impacted workforces around the world over the past few years.

To retain our associates, we believe it is crucial to continually focus on making sure our associates are highly engaged and feel valued. We further address retention efforts in several ways, including training our leaders in our solutions such as The 6 Critical Practices for Leading a Team, Multipliers, Unconscious Bias, and Leading Change. Our employee retention practices include holding consistent, compelling one-on-one interviews, where leaders regularly take time to connect with their associates and to understand what is working well for them and what is not. In our 2022 Culture Survey, 86 percent of associates said they had at least one meaningful conversation with their manager in the past year. Though one conversation seems like a low benchmark, these conversations are essential because they are not performance reviews. Our Contribution Conversations are an open, ongoing dialogue focused on how our associates want to contribute and bring their “best selves” to work. Based on these discussions, leaders are encouraged to “clear the path” of those things that may hold the associate back. We aim to establish a culture of feedback where feedback for both leaders and associates is a normal and worthwhile part of how work gets done. Contribution Conversations align with our core value to focus on the whole person and allow our associates to find their voice. We believe these efforts are vital to creating an atmosphere of continuous improvement.

 




We currently have six Employee Resource Groups (ERGs): Veterans and First Responders, BOLD (Black Originators, Leaders, and Doers), WIN (Women's International Network), Global Wellness, FC Ability, and LGBTQ+. These employee-led networks serve historically underinvested and underrepresented associates and allies. They offer safe spaces for people to come together based on a shared interest in a specific dimension of equity and inclusion while actively working to enhance career opportunities, build cultural competence, and foster community within the organization. We believe our ERGs represent and support our diverse workforce, facilitate networking, and foster connections and engagement within the organization.

The Mentorship Program is company-wide and is for all employees. Mentees and mentors are paired based on self-selected areas of interest and ability, giving the partners a great deal of flexibility for how they can best engage with each other for mutual benefit and professional development. This program started as 30 pairs of mentors and mentees and has now increased to 86 pairs of participants.

Our compensation plans are audited periodically to confirm ongoing pay equity. We provide a generous personal time off benefit as well as a flexible and inclusive holiday schedule, reflecting the diversity of our workforce and the celebration of various cultural and religious affiliations. We also offer 100 percent salary continuance for up to 12 weeks in a rolling 12-month period, for qualifying medical leaves, and provide many other employee-minded benefits.

Our focus on human capital has been a hallmark of Franklin Covey for decades, understanding that people truly are a company’s most valuable asset, and that culture is an organization’s ultimate competitive advantage. In 2017, our Organization and Compensation Committee determined to make Talent Stewardship a standing agenda item at committee meetings, and we recently included diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts as an additional standing agenda item. The Organization and Compensation Committee is actively involved in helping to determine best practices and implement new and innovative ways to help us continually improve in attracting, developing, and retaining top talent for Franklin Covey.
