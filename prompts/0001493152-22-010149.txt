Item 1. | Business
------------+---------

Organization
 
We were originally incorporated as WrapMail, Inc. in Florida on October 11, 2005 in order to tap into a largely un-serviced segment of the web-based advertising industry. Effective January 5, 2015, WRAP acquired 100% ownership of Prosperity Systems, Inc., a New York corporation incorporated on April 2, 2008, in order to acquire Prosperity’s office productivity software suite as a complement to WRAP’s existing intellectual property. After its acquisition, the Company transferred Prosperity’s operations to WRAP; however, the Company does not currently actively operate its WRAP or Prosperity divisions pending decision on whether to hold on to, sell or repurpose such assets.
 
Around the first quarter of 2017, the Company began to transition into the health and wellness space, including the development, processing and sale of hemp derived products, and now operates three distinct divisions: retail sales, R&D and manufacturing, and durable medical devices. The Company also has a hemp cultivation division which is currently non-operational.
 
On May 15, 2017, WRAP changed its name to Canbiola, Inc. to reflect its transition. On March 6, 2020 CANB changed its name to “Can B̅ Corp.” in order to segregate its corporate identity from its lead products branded under the Canbiola™ brand.
 
Effective December 27, 2010, WRAP effected a 10 for 1 forward stock split of its common stock. Effective June 4, 2013, WRAP effected a 1 for 10 reverse stock split of its common stock. On March 6, 2020, Can B̅ effected a 1 for 300 reverse stock split of its common stock. The accompanying consolidated financial statements retroactively reflect these stock splits. On March 13, 2022, the Company effectuated a 1 for 15 reverse split of its stock.
 
Business Segments
 
The Company is in the business of promoting health and wellness through its development, manufacture and sale of products containing cannabinoids derived from hemp biomass and the licensing of durable medical devises.
 
Hemp is thought to contain anywhere from 60 to over 100 naturally occurring compounds (cannabinoids) thought to interact with cannabinoid receptors present on the surface of cells in various parts of the central nervous system. The effects of cannabinoids are thought to depend on the area of the brain involved. Cannabidiol (“CBD”) is probably one of the most well-known of these compounds, thought to have many beneficial uses. CBD is incorporated into many of the Company’s products; however, the Company has recently begun extracting and processing cannabinol (“CBN”), cannabigerol (“CBG”), delta-10 and delta-8 for its products and for wholesale to third-parties looking to incorporate such compounds into their products. The Company has all of its hemp based raw materials to incorporate into products tested by a 3rd party independent laboratory. The Company aims to be the premier provider of the highest quality natural hemp cannabinoid products on the market through sourcing the very best raw material and developing a variety of products it believes will improve people’s lives in a variety of areas.



I- | Pure Health Products 
---+-------------------------

 
Pure Health Products, LLC, a New York limited liability company (“PHP” or “Pure Health Products”) is the Company’s manufacturing arm. PHP manufactures all of the Company’s CBD products and also provides white label manufacturing and production services to third parties and performs research and development for the Company. Through PHP, the Company is able to control the manufacturing process of its products while reducing its production costs. Pasquale Ferro is the president of PHP.
 
In December, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests in Pure Health Products, with which it had had and has an exclusive production agreement, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement (“PHP Acquisition Agreement”). In January, 2019, PHP acquired certain assets from Seven Chakras, LLC (“Seven Chakras”), a former competitor, which assets included the rights and title to (i) Seven Chakras’ proprietary formulas, methods, trade secrets, and know-how related to the production of Seven Chakras’ CBD products, (ii) Seven Chakras’ tradename, domain name, and social media sites, and (iii) other assets of Seven Chakras including but not limited to raw materials, equipment, packaging and labeling materials, mailing lists, and marketing materials.

The Company currently has four in-house branded CBD products that are manufactured by PHP and sold to consumers, Canbiola™, Nu Wellness™, Seven Chakras™ and Pure Leaf Oil™.
 
The Company’s Canbiola™ CBD products are sold via medical professionals under distribution agreements and directly by the Company via its website and vending machines. The Canbiola™ assets are held directly by the Company and include tinctures, soaps, bath soaks, cryo-gel, salves, massage oils, powders, capsules and roll-ons.
 
The Company’s Pure Leaf Oil™ assets are held by PHP. Pure Leaf Oil™ CBD products are sold via PHP’s website, direct to consumer via walk-in business, and through distributors and are meant for retail customers not referred through the medical community. Pure Leaf Oil™ products include massage oils, joint salves, bath salts, nano sprays, drops, and cryo-gels. PHP also holds the assets related to its Seven Chakras™ brand. Seven Chakras™ is targeted toward health clubs, spas, and beauty lines and CBD products include lotion, massage oils, roll-ons, isolate, powders, capsules, and bath soaks. Severn Chakras™ has its own internet website and direct markets to its customer base.
 
PHP has also created a new brand, Nu Wellness™, which it intends to market through distributors as an independent pharmacy brand targeted towards independent retail drug stores. Nu Wellness™ has yet to launch or make sales, which are intended to occur sometime in 2022.
 
All finished products are stored for time- quality measurement, and each batch of every product is sent to an independent third-party lab for a Certificate of Analysis (“COA”) of the finished products. These COA’s are both listed on our web site and available via the QR code on every retail package.
 

II- | Hemp Operating Division 
----+----------------------------

 
The Company’s hemp operating division performs R&D for the Company including for CBN, CBG, delta-8 and delta-10. It also produces industrial hemp and processes hemp biomass, isolate and isomers.
 
Around March 17, 2021, the Company acquired assets through its newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary, Botanical Biotech, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“BB” or “Botanical Biotech”). Such assets include certain materials and manufacturing equipment and marketing or promotional designs, brochures, advertisements, concepts, literature, books, media rights, rights against any other person or entity in respect of any of the foregoing and all other promotional properties, in each case primarily used, developed or acquired by the Sellers for use in connection with the ownership and operation of the BB Assets.
 
Around August 12, 2021, the Company and CO Botanicals LLC, a Nevada limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of CANB (“COB”) acquired hemp processing assets from TWS Pharma, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company and L7 TWS Pharma, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company. COB operates out of Mead, CO.
 
Around August 13, 2021 the Company and TN Botanicals LLC, a Nevada limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of CANB (“TNB”) acquired assets from Music City Botanicals, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company (“MCB”) including certain equipment, inventory, and intellectual property. TNB operates out of Mcminville, TN.
 
From its Miami lab, the Company processes hemp isolate into isomers such as CBN, CBG, delta-8 and delta-10. At its Tennessee location, the Company produces industrial hemp, processes hemp biomass to isolate, processes isolate to isomers such as CBN, CBG, delta-8 and delta-10, and performs research and development on cannabinoids such as such as CBN, CBG, delta-8, delta-10, CBD and CBDA. At its Colorado facilities, the Company produces industrial hemp and processes hemp biomass to isolate. The biomass and isolate processed by the Company may be produced by the Company or purchased from third parties. All of the Company’s end products contain .3% or less of THC (delta-9).
 
The Company is also in the process of building out an event/consumption lounge at its Miami lab for showcasing its products and building brand awareness. It is intended that he lounge will attract corporate executives, socialites, influencers and celebrities as a place where they can hang out and sample the Company’s products, including vapes and edibles (each non-THC). The lounge will have 1,500 sqft indoor space and a 1,000 sqft patio. The lounge will have a plug and play surround sound system, 140 inch hi-def 4k bridged TVs and host podcasts, karaoke, and DJ with stage capabilities and will offer bar grub and food truck menus. The Company has also executed a contract with a developer to build and operate additional lounges across the country, subject to certain terms and conditions, including the success of the Miami lounge once open.



III- | Durable Medical Equipment 
-----+------------------------------

 
Through its medical device division, Duramed, Inc. (“Duramed”) and Duramed MI LLC, a Nevada limited liability company fka DuramedNJ, LLC (“Duramed MI”), the Company serves the post-surgery medical patient arena aiming to aid in recovery and pain reduction.

In November 2018, the Company formed Duramed, Inc. to facilitate the manufacture and sale of durable medical equipment (“DME”) incorporating CBD. On January 14, 2019, Duramed entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “Sam MOU”) with Sam International (“Sam”) and ZetrOZ Systems LLC (“ZetrOZ” and, collectively with Sam, the “Manufacturers”). Pursuant to the Sam MOU, the Manufacturers granted Duramed the exclusive right to distribute sam® Pro 2.0 (SA271) and sam® Gel Coupling Patches (UB-14-72) within the United States for the Personal Injury Protection/No Fault Market during the term of the Sam MOU. Duramed has agreed to purchase monthly minimums from the Manufacturers at a price per Unit of $2,447. The exclusivity of the Distribution License granted to Duramed under the Sam MOU was dependent upon meeting the monthly minimum, which did not happen. In addition, Duramed was granted the right to distribute sam® Gel Capture Patches (UB-14-24). Duramed will get rebates of 2%-3% based on the volume of products sold by it. We did not meet the monthly minimums as contemplated by the Sam MOU and as such we are currently distributing the aforementioned products on an at-will, non-exclusive basis.
 
On May 29, 2019, the Company created Duramed MI to execute the same business strategy into the no-fault insurance market in New Jersey that it had developed in New York; however, Duramed MI is not currently operating in NJ and is in the process of moving its operations to Michigan, which have not begun yet. None of Duramed’s products are reimbursable under any federal program.
 

IV- | Green Grow Farms 
----+---------------------

 
Green Grow Farms, Inc., a New York corporation (“GGFI” or “Green Grow”) served as the Company’s hemp cultivation arm. Through GGFI, the Company grew its own hemp in New York and partnered with third party growers in other states whereby GGFI provided the farmers with seed and training and splits profits with the farmers. GGFI was to supply the Company with all hemp needed for the Company to produce its CBD products, which hemp would be processed by a third party and shipped to the Company’s production facility in Lacey, WA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, currently, it is less expensive to buy crude oil and isolate than to produce such from hemp grown by the Company. Accordingly, the Company has stopped its Green Grow operations in favor of buying raw products from third parties. If and when it makes economic sense to grow its own hemp again, the Company will resume Green Grow operations.
 

V- | Imbibe Wellness Solutions 
---+------------------------------

 
On February 22, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase additional CBD brand assets from Imbibe Health Solutions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The assets have been placed into the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Imbibe Wellness Solutions, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (fka Radical Tactical LLC) (“Imbibe Wellness”), and include the intellectual property rights, including trademarks, logos, know how, formulations, productions procedures, copyrights, social media accounts, domain names and marketing materials relating to the Imbibe™ branded products, including a muscle and joint salve, unscented fizzy bath soak, CALM massage oil, Me x 3 Metabolic Energy (energy and dietary supplement), and Muscle, Joints & Back CBD Cryo Gel. Imbibe Wellness is intended to develop and sell specific celebrity endorsed products and products promoted through influencer branding, which brands are expected to launch in 2022. Walter Hoelzel is the president of Imbibe Wellness.
 
FDA DISCLAIMER
 
The statements found herein have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Company’s products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or medical condition.
Competitive Conditions
 
The CBD and cannabis markets are flooded with competition ranging from mom and pop operations to multi-million-dollar conglomerates, many with longer operating histories, more capital and/or more industry knowledge than the Company. The Company hopes to partner with or engage industry specialists to help set it apart from its numerous competitors. The Company believes that one of those points of differentiation will be its 3rd party independent testing “Certificate of Analysis” conducted on all of the CBD isolate products it purchases and posting of those lab results on its website. The three largest CBD companies known to the Company are Elixinol LLC, a UK based company with $37 million revenue, GW Pharmaceuticals also UK based with $19 million revenue, and Aurora Cannabis based in Canada with just over $19 million revenue. The top USA companies include Medical Marijuana, CV Sciences, Gaia Herbs, and Charlotte’s Web with respective revenues of $59, $48, $45, and $17 million. Worthy of note is that Charlotte’s Web is on the shelf right next to us at Northwell Health.
 
Hemp biomass and its derivative products have glutted the US market, benefiting our manufacturing divisions with less expensive product but causing our hemp cultivation and processing division to become financially imprudent until the oversupply issue has resolved. Thus, we have halted operations in such division for the time being but may resume such operations should a sound opportunity present. Although we have contract farm agreements in place to grow and harvest hemp biomass, other raw materials for our finished products have at least three sources of supply in the open market and we have little risk of any ingredient supply at this time.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company employs, through its Pure Health Product LLC division, two full time product researchers and developers and technology experts who, on a daily basis, set the quality standards and new product development status and time-line agendas under the direct supervision of the Company’s management team.
 
The Company has not been granted any patents or trademarks by the USPTO or by any patent or trademark office of a foreign nation.

This information may be found at www.sec.gov and posted on our website at www.canbcorp.com.
Government Regulation
 
The cultivation and sale of hemp and hemp products is federally regulated under the United States Farm Bill. The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp as a Schedule 1 Substance under the Controlled Substances Act; however, rules and regulations relating to manufacture and sale of CBD and other hemp derivative products under the Farm Bill must still be promulgated and are expected to impact the Company’s operations. As the industry and our product lines expand, it is uncertain what other statutory schemes and agencies will start to regulate our products. The FDA currently still considers the addition of CBD to food products, cosmetics or supplements to be illegal and prohibits the advertisement of CBD products with health claims. The Company must also comply with each state’s laws relating to the sale and manufacture, as applicable, of hemp-based products, with some states allowing the sale of cannabinoid products, some states limiting to medical purposes and some states banning outright. These regulations may affect, among others, the way the Company manufactures and distributes its products, the way the Company is taxed, the way the Company banks, the location of the Company’s facilities, the content and testing of the Company’s products, and the quality of the Company’s services. The Company has not sought or received approval of any of its products from the FDA or any state agency. Should the Company be sanctioned by the FDA or state agencies, it could materially, negatively impact the Company’s operations and revenue sources.
 
We are also subject to general business regulations and laws as well as Federal and state regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce or other online services, and increase the cost of providing online services. These regulations and laws may cover sweepstakes, taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. Unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business and results of operations. CBD sales are additionally state regulated for shipping and the Company maintains a current list.
