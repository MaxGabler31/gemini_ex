ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
LSEB Creative Corp. (the Company) was incorporated on April 3, 2019 in Wyoming. Our business office is located at 30 N. Gould St. #4000, Sheridan, WY 82801. Our telephone number is 1-800-701-8561.
 
LSEB Creative Corp., a company incorporated in the State of Wyoming, is a specialty retailer that offers men and women elevated swimwear designs, constructed with the highest quality materials and techniques. With the recent substantial growth seen in the swimwear industry, our affluent, contemporary target market is in search of assortment and impressive concepts. By offering a new concept to swimwear; gender-coordinating collections that allow the wearer to look and feel powerful, partnered or individually, we will capture this new, sought-after space within the market. Our priority is to design products that offer superior fit, performance, and comfort while incorporating both function and fashionability. Our strategy is to capitalize on these existing opportunities in the luxury swimwear market through the development and growth of our web site wwwlaurenbentleyswim.com, and wholesaler partnerships on a global scale. We believe eCommerce will allow our target market convenient and easy access to our products while effectively building brand awareness and entry into new markets. We are committed to building a highly recognized brand, offering captivating customer experiences that drive long-term loyalty. By focusing on these key areas and tactics, we will successfully align ourselves with our target market and profit accordingly.

Focusing on luxury swimwear items for both men and women, LSEBs collection will embody its affluent, contemporary target market entirely. The individual mens and womens sub-collections will be coordinating, as the partnered portion of our target market values looking well put-together as a couple, as well as individually.

LSEBs designs are highly influenced by ready-to-wear fashions. Our intention is that individually, our designs are versatile enough that they can exceed their intended purpose; swimming and lounging, making appearances in the customers daily wardrobe. To ensure the highest quality in fabrics, hardware and embellishments, LSEB will put emphasis on the sourcing process for each individually item. Newest technologies in fabrics and manufacturing will be utilized in design and production stages, and may include technologies such as, quick drying finishes or shapewear fabric. From goods to packaging and labeling, the brand identity has been absolutely thought through and is evident across all areas.
 
Our mission is to become a single source of innovative luxury swimwear for our target market. The Company has recognized the sales and profit potential of luxury swimwear for men and women, as consumers are willing to invest in the swimwear category and seek new brands and product assortment.

Based on our financial history since inception, our auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company currently has no revenue, and has limited operating history. We do not consider our self a blank check company and we do not have any plan, arrangement, or understanding to engage in a merger or acquisition with any other entity. We do not consider ourselves a blank check company, as we have a specific business plan and have moved forward with our business operations. Specifically, we, while in the development stage, are proceeding with our business plan by constructing and implementing an automated website. We have taken certain steps in furtherance of this business plan including establishing the website and the establishment of relationships with suppliers and manufacturers.
Swimwear Market Trends
 
The Company believes the outlook for the swimwear industry, and LSEB in particular, is very promising. Over the next several years, LSEB is expected to benefit significantly from certain favorable demographic and industry trends. With the swimwear market forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2018 to 2024, it is clear that consumers are not only willing to invest in swimwear goods, but are seeking new brands and product assortment. According to Allied Market Research, the global swimwear market was valued at $18,454 million in 2017 and is projected to reach $28,148 million by 2024. Asia-Pacific and Latin America, Middle East and Africa (LAMEA) collectively contributed a global market share of over 30 percent in 2017. Asia-Pacific individually is projected to grow at a significant CAGR of 8.4 percent. Key players in the global swimwear industry include Haddow Group Plc, Nike Inc., Boardriders, Inc., Arena Italia S.p.A., ONeill, Inc., Swimwear Anywhere, Inc., Adidas AG, Gap Inc., Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation (PVH Corp.), and Perry Ellis International Inc (Allied Market Research). Recent movement in the industry includes Perry Ellis International, Inc., entering into Nike Swim distribution agreements in Latin America with R1 Sports Ltda in Brazil, Uldin SA in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Superdeporte Plus Peru S.A.C in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.
Luxury in Swimwear
 
As of 2021, luxury accounted for 9% of the womens swimwear market. By 2025, the market share grew to 16%, with most-stocked brands being Eres, Solid & Striped, and Melissa Obadash. Luxury e-commerce platforms, such as Farfetch and Matches, have increased their womens swimwear offerings from anywhere between 288 – 349%. Market forecasters believe that its the global luxury e-commerce retailers who will be most successful in expanding the swimwear category (Edited.com).
Travel and Tourism
 
Travel and tourism is one of the worlds largest industries, reaching a global economic contribution (direct, indirect and induced) of a record $8.8 trillion in 2018. In 2017, $882.4 billion was invested in tourism. This was forecasted to rise by 4.8% in 2018 and by 4.3% in continuing years, making total investment US$1,408.3 billion by 2028. (World Travel & Tourism Council, 2018). Of this, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa experienced a combined economic activity increase of $767 billion since 2017. The industrys fastest-growing region is the Caribbean, which generated 15.5 percent more economic activity this past year, than in 2017 (Forbes). According to recent data obtained by IATA (International Air Transportation Association), approximately 35% of vacationing Americans had intentions of travelling internationally to destinations that require swimwear attire in 2018, which is a 9% increase from 2016. The average consumer is changing their spending habits, and travel is benefiting as a result. In addition to these statistics, there is also a growing social trend of spending on experiences, such as travel, rather than tangible goods (Deloitte, 2017). With tourism and travel expected to continue growing at consistent rate to 2025, the swimwear industry is sure to reflect a similar advance.
 
Luxury in Travel and Tourism
 
According to a report titled Luxury Travel Market – Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2021-2022, published by Allied Market Research, the global luxury travel market is expected to generate $1,154 billion by 2022, increasing at a CAGR of 6.4% during 2016-2022. An increase in middle and upper-class spending, in addition to a growing tendency for exotic travel, is resulting in a rapid increase in the demand for luxury travel. Americans with an annual income of more than US$100,000 make up 20% of the total population, however, that same 20% make up more than half of all US travel spending (Skift, 2018).

Operations
 
Product
 
Our product design and development efforts are led by Lauren Bentley and include a team of designers based in the US and abroad who are dedicated to premium quality. Our design and development team identifies trends based on market intelligence and research, proactively seeks the input of our target market and broadly seeks inspiration consistent with our goals of fit, style and function superiority. As we strive provide our customers with intricately designed and skillfully constructed garments, our team works closely with our suppliers to ensure specifications are reached. We will partner with independent inspection, verification, and testing companies, who conduct a variety of tests on our fabrics, testing performance characteristics including retention, abrasion resistance, colorfastness, and sun damage. We offer premium swimwear that is optimized for fit, comfort, functionality and style. By combining functionality with elevated design, our brand not only has strong consumer appeal, but also attracts a growing core of consumers that desire swimwear suited to their lifestyles. We believe our superior quality and technically advanced products allow us to maintain premium price points and encourage repeat purchases among our customers.
Design and Styling
 
Focusing on luxury swimwear items for both men and women, LSEBs collection will embody its affluent, contemporary target market entirely. The individual mens and womens sub-collections will be coordinating, as the partnered portion of our target market values looking well put-together as a couple. The physical presence of our collection has the following defining attributes; fine details and finishings, alluring silhouettes, coordinating pieces, and a runway-ready look. The designs are highly influenced by ready-to-wear fashions Our intention is that individually, our designs are versatile enough that they can exceed their intended purpose - swimming and lounging, making appearances in the customers daily wardrobe. To ensure the highest quality in fabrics, hardware and embellishments, LSEB will put emphasis on the sourcing process for all items individually. Newest technologies in fabrics and manufacturing will be utilized in design and production stages, and may include technologies such as, quick drying finishes or shapewear fabric. From goods to packaging and labeling, the brand identity has been absolutely thought through and is evident across all areas.
Adjustability, Fit, and Sizing
 
We believe the authenticity of our products is driven by a number of factors. These factors include our inspired design process, our use of technical materials, our sophisticated manufacturing methods and our innovative product features
 
LSEB is wholly committed to developing garments that enhance the customers body, evoking feelings of empowerment and boldness. Technologically advanced fabrics, techniques, and adjustable features, will collectively result in a truly tailored fit, unmatched by anyone.
 
Womens
 
Adjustability functions that appear in some of our womens designs include adjustable shoulder straps, tie-back straps, and hook & eye bra closures. Additional notable fir features include shapewear inserts, underwire or floating underwire to give added support, and molded cups. Each womens SKU is designed and constructed with the intention of enhancing the female figure. Sizing scales to vary based upon individual styles but will categorize as one of the following; numeric sizing (Ex: 2-18) or bra sizing (Ex: 32B/C – 38 B/C).
  Page | 7

Mens
 
Our goal is not to reconstruct, but to enhance the fit and styling of mens swimwear currently on the market. We believe that men desire and deserve a perfectly fitting swim garment, just as women do. An example our improvements includes the addition of hidden, inner drawstring to our swim trunks, which will reinforce the zipper and snap closure, ensuring security during use. Other styles include waist fasteners on either side of the body, which allow the wearer to further adjust the garment, creating a tailored fit. Our technologically advanced stretch net lining conforms to the body without restriction for optimal comfort. Along with these features, our size offering, which will be numeric (Ex: 26-40) and inseam length options (Ex: 4 or 6), will provide the perfect fit for every man.
Pricing Strategy
 
Upon launch, LSEB will follow a competitive pricing strategy; the process of selecting strategic price points to best take advantage of a product-based market relative to competition. We comprehend the trials and tribulations that come with launching a new brand in a conglomerate-ruled industry (luxury). Our competitive strategy will allow us to effectively reach our target market, build brand recognition, and establish unisons with our primary competitors. Following this introduction stage, we will look to restructure this pricing strategy to a premium pricing strategy to further create desirability among consumers.
Womens

● | Cover-up; $275-400 USD

Mens
 

● | Swim trunk; $220-240 USD

Product Sourcing
 
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We instead choose to contract with third-party vendors for fabrics, trims, and garment manufacturing. We do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources for the production and supply of noted components, as we believe in commissioning work where we will see exceptional results, which is constantly evolving. An additional way in which we ensure customers are receiving superior product is with our design and development team, who works closely with our suppliers to ensure the particular specifications of our products are met.
 
Our manufacturers are well versed in luxury fashion products and provide us with the skills and efficiency necessary to adapt to changing trends and new technologies. We plan to support future growth through multiple manufacturers. We have developed relationships with a number of our vendors and take great care to ensure that they share our commitment to quality and ethics. We do not, however, have any long-term agreements requiring us to use any specific manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products in the long term. We require that all of our manufacturers adhere to a code of conduct regarding quality of manufacturing, working conditions and other social concerns. We will also work with a leading inspection and verification firm to closely monitor each suppliers compliance to applicable law. In managing our sourcing relationships, Ms. Bentley has existing relationships with manufacturers and will continue to explore new vendors, making changes when and if necessary.
 
Our company stands for the highest level of quality, thus our materials and trims will be sourced from various countries across the world; each geographic region and specific factory have individual capabilities, skills, and technologies. Our belief is to source based on quality, not ease. Manufacturing will take place in Europe, as this is where craftsmanship was born. Here we will find the best of swimwear, intimates, and dressmaking ateliers. The Company currently has relationships with the following suppliers Carvico USA Inc, Eurojersey S.p.A, Tessitura Taiana Virgilio S.p.A, Lampo by Ditta Giovanni Lanfranchi S.p.A,, and Chargeurs * PCC Fashion Technologies.

It is also worth noting that our millennial market values the longevity of a garment, as they are aware of the importance of sustainability in fashion. By sourcing based on quality, and manufacturing in small quantities at the most qualified factories in the world, we will be able to meet our markets values and expectations.
Distribution
 
LSEB will be utilizing a multi-channel distribution strategy, which will include both B2B and B2C relationships. Upon launching LSEB, our main distribution channel will be eCommerce, as it will ensure our highest profitable margins and allow immediate access for the consumers. Additionally, during the development and launch stages of the company, emphasis will be placed on establishing relationships with buyers and retailers worldwide, with the intension of pursuing a retail distribution channel following our introduction stage.
Technology
 
Our ecommerce platform will be powered by a bespoke Wordpress website - developed by Stories Design Studio Ltd., - as Wordpress software is secure, easy to use, and offers features such as responsive web design, search engine optimization (SEO), and fully customized pages. Its these key features that set Wordpress apart from other ecommerce software and will allow us to build an advanced platform for our customers to shop.
 
Because LSEB understands the importance of our customers and focusing our strategies based on their needs and wants, an advanced Customer Relationship Management system (CRM system) will play a critical role in the success of our business. The system will gather, organize, and analyze customer information and preferences, which will allow us to cater to each individual customer better. The advantage is improved efficiency and increase sales.

Marketing and Brand Recognition
 
Strategic communications are central to building and reinforcing the LSEB brand. Our advertising, marketing and public relations strategy will be established by the Companys marketing team and, where appropriate, implemented with the support of industry professionals. The Companys marketing communications strategy will focus on both brand awareness, as well as more traditional product/price advertising. Marketing imagery and content will focus primarily on product details and fit, as well as brand personality, exhibiting our competency and identity as a luxury brand. Focusing on the consistency and quality of our complete marketing mix will establish brand recognition, and ultimately LSEB as an industry leader.
 
Mobile and Web Marketing/Sales
 
Through our research we found that 67% of the buying process now takes place digitally (Digital Marketing Institute). We plan to capitalize on this evidence by directing majority of our focus towards content, processes, and analytics across these channels. Our eCommerce website will be built bespoke by our favored marketing agency, Stories Design Studio Ltd. Website optimization, striking content, and the development of an omni-channel experience will be of primary focus. Modern day consumers are most likely to stay engaged when digital information and content is quick to access and easily understood. Consistency and interconnection across all digital platforms, including web and mobile, are detrimental to the natural growth of our brand and sales. Additional web and mobile tactics, such as reduced clicks, eye-catching content, and aesthetically pleasing graphic design, will be utilized to guarantee customer satisfaction. By implementing said tactics and regularly updating our platform with fresh content, the Company will ensure consistent traffic and sales.
 
Below you will see mobile and web design mock-up images;
 

Email Marketing
 
In 2020, email remains the leading communication channel for consumers, placing it as an important focus for the Company. Prior to launch, great emphasis will be put on composing and expanding our Email List, communicating with the regularly to tease sneak-peaks, our launch date, and any additional marketing campaigns. By doing so, we will secure an audience among our target market and create excitement and desirability around the launch of our brand. To gain said Email List, we will draw on A) industry contacts, B) prompt consumers with an opt-in form available and linked to all web and mobile outlets prior to launch, and C) an Email Marketing Service such as Drip, which focuses on intelligent marketing automation to convert visitors into subscribers. These tactics, along with others, will successfully capture our audience and ensure tailored, consistent communication as our brand launches and expands.

Event Marketing
 
Upon the launch of LSEB, there will be an event held to raise awareness of the brand, generate excitement, and most importantly, showcase the collection. It will be attended by industry professionals, potential buyers, press, influencers, and supporters. The collection will be presented as an ongoing runway show throughout the evening. Location, décor, food and drinks, and music will be thoughtfully chosen in order to best represent the brands overall style and values.
Direct Mail
 
Our strategy for direct mail focuses on PR packages. The packages will include a selection of products from the collection, brand information, and a personalized note. This will be sent to influencers that embody the brand, such as fashions favorite couple Negin Mirsalehi and Maurits Stibbe (Instagram; negin_mirsalehi and m_stibbe), power couple Desi Perkins and Steven Perkins (Instagram; desiperkins and stevenperkins), and female entrepreneur Audrey Leighton Rogers (@frassyaudrey). These influencers, along with others, would then wear and document themselves wearing our product on their social media platforms. This strategy is expected to have great impact brand recognition and sales, as these influencers often have reach of one-million plus followers worldwide.
Print Advertising
 
Although it may seem print advertising is diminishing with todays technology, the fashion industry and its consumers remain appreciative and continue to invest in the tactile sensation of printed media. Accordingly, print advertising will play an important part in our strategy, with focus on securing featured advertising in various fashion publications across the world. By establishing healthy relationships with industry professionals and hosting them at our launch event, we will then be able to nurture further conversations regarding potential publication features.
Marketplace
 
Competition
 
General
 
The market for swimwear is highly competitive. In conjunction with increasing competition from established companies that are expanding their production and marketing, we are seeing an influx of new entrants to the market.
 
LSEB believes it will be well positioned to compete against many swimwear brands by concentrating on providing high levels of professional service and focusing on improving customer satisfaction and guidance. The Company believes that consumers will pay for its value-added services and will be attracted to its premium selection of mens and womens swimwear products. Competition in the luxury swimwear industry is based principally on brand image and recognition as well as product quality, innovation, style, distribution, and price. We believe that we can successfully compete based on our premium brand image and our innovative product. We also believe our ability to introduce new product innovations and combine versatility and fashion will set us apart from our competitors.
 
Many swimwear products are available to our customers from a number of retailers. In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products.
 
Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices. Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results.
 
Generally speaking, specialty swimwear brick and mortar retail stores focus on low to mid-end inexpensive lines. High-end or luxury department stores best cater to our target market, but also provide very little price comparison or depth of product. They tend to offer small collections of few select brands, which does not allow much option for consumers.
 
Womens
 
The womens swimwear market has become increasingly saturated with brands that embody similar brand personas and business models. Generally speaking, these brands offer trend-driven styles, average fit and construction standards, at mid-high tier pricing. These brands tend to lack concise business or marketing plans and relying on social media marketing for sales conversions. While this may prove successful during the rise of the swimwear industry, it will not ensure long-term success or profitability. Although, such repetition has revealed an untouched area in the market; a consumer base that values an air of sophistication and exclusivity.
  Page | 11

Mens
 
In contrast to womens, the total market share for mens swimwear is comprised of few brands. Athletic brands and global fashion houses are the leading suppliers of mens swimwear, with few additional options falling in-between. Historically, male consumers have valued few choices, ease of purchase, and brand recognition. However, during the last five years, we have seen this shift considerably. Its become evident that men have come to value the art of shopping, and particularly appreciate experiential shopping experiences. This matured consumer mentality among men urges the industry to react by offering fresh designs and unparalleled customer experiences and service.
Current Alternatives
 
Note; the following Competitive Analysis examines The Companys decided primary competitors. Each company is considered a Primary Competitor based on the following shared elements; Product Offering, Price Point, Target Market, and Quality
Amaio Swim – Womens Line
 
Analysis
 
Amaio is a Los Angeles based brand that aims to break the traditional swim and resort space by merging swimwear with runway fashions. Designed for the cosmopolitan woman, the brand places a large emphasis on creating the next generation of Après Swim, a term that refers to activities following swimming and the attire associated with it. This concept, along with their soaring prices, allows Amino to hone in on an extremely niche market, and in return, has exceptional customer loyalty.
 
The company uses a premium pricing strategy, similar to LSEB, however their prices are extremely high in relation to majority of brands in the industry. This is mainly due to the intricate construction of their designs, as well as the heritage mills they source fabrics from. However, these factors also cause large variances in prices across each commodity (maillot, two-piece, resort wear). By reducing the number of price points across each commodity, the customers perceived value from one item to the next will be more in-line. A clear and concise pricing strategy is easier for consumers to understand and allows them to feel comfortable with their purchase.
 
With digital sales increasing at an unfathomable rate, it is important that modern retail businesses concentrate on expanding their reach and sales via digital platforms. Although Amaio swimwear utilizes strong, brand-focused visual content on their social media platforms, it is clear by their number of followers that these platforms do not have high conversion rates. With only 19.8K followers on Instagram, Amaio may want to consider social media growth strategies to increase traffic and conversion rates, as well as brand recognition.
 
ERES Paris
 
Analysis
 
ERES Paris was founded in the late 1960s when Irène Leroux made the courageous decision to carry swimsuits year-round after haven taken over her parents sport shop. Along with offering this commodity year-round, the company became a leader in the industry through their early adoption of Lycra and introduction of mix-and-match swimwear sets, which allowed women to better personalize their fit and look. The brand focuses on offering exceptional quality goods in simplistic silhouettes that complement the female body, which has positioned them as a staple swimwear retailer in the industry.
 
Chanel Groupe acquired ERES Paris in 1996, which was a fitting partnership, as the two brands gained popularity from their timeless, polished, feminine looks. Unlike Chanel, who continues to incorporate innovative fashion items into their assortment, ERES strictly focuses on simplistic designs and refrains from offering fashion items. This narrow assortment results in a missed market amongst women looking for statement swimwear.
 
ERES practices vertical integration, which allows the company to avoid additional surcharges and fees related to manufacturing, duties, freight, etc. The company currently offers lingerie loungewear, and accessories in addition to swimwear. Its likely that ERES will look to expand their product category offering in future to gain additional business and customers. As a result of being vertically integrated, introducing new commodities could result in the hire of an additional specialized team, or sourcing new supplier with little to know previously stablished relationships.

Orlebar Brown – Mens Line
 
Analysis
 
Notable for bringing the concept of tailored clothing to mens swimwear, Orlebar Brown is a staple in the industry. As the first brand of their kind, the company was able to quickly gain a customer following. But it is their consistency in product quality and customer focus that has allowed them to obtain the robust level customer loyalty they have to this day. The company is most widely known for their quirky Snap Short, which is a featured photograph printed swim short each season.
 
The company was established in 2007, but has since been acquired by Chanel Inc. in 2018, which has provided them with extensive resources, financial support, and recognition. The companys assortment has grown from an exclusive swim short offering to additional categories, such as mens resort wear and accessories, as well as kidswear. The company has a definite opportunity in expanding their assortment with new commodities and/or markets, such as womens swimwear or mens ready-to-wear.
 
Between their progressive ecommerce website, seven bricks and mortar stores, as well as countless wholesalers across the world, Orlebar Browns reach is extremely impressive and effective. Where the company has opportunity to increase reach is by undertaking an Experiential Marketing strategy, which could include more frequent, innovative events with customers or enhancing the traditional bricks and mortar environment to be more engaging or interactive for the customer.
 
Frescobol Carioca
 
Analysis
 
Influenced by the Brazillian landscape and denizens, or otherwise known as Cariocas, Frescobol Carioca offers a range of luxury lifestyle products; Mens swimwear being the majority. The brand was founded in 2009 with a strong focus on environmentalism, quality, and ultimately allowing their customers to live like a Carioca.
 
Frescobol Carioca has increased their brand recognition through collaborations with world-renowned companies, such as Louis Vuitton and Eden Rock Hotel. Although such collaborations have increased the companys business, it is evident that they did not successfully market these ventures and therefore did not take full advantage of the opportunity. Although the company has powerful social media outlets, it is their ecommerce that is lacking curated content and fresh graphic design. By upgrading their ecommerce and harmonizing their various platforms, Frescobol Caricoa would increase communication, customer traffic, and time spent on the platform.
 
Due to Frescobol Cariocas focus on environmental impact, they use an artisanal approach by running limited quantities of the items in their collections. Concepts such as this create great urgency for customers to buy, however it also prevents potential sales above and beyond the quantities produced. By producing larger quantities and shipping more stock to wholesalers and bricks and mortar locations, the brand could profit from additional sales rather than selling-out.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
LSEB will be well positioned to maintain healthy competition with brands. Notable competitive strengths include concept and assortment, high-functioning eCommerce platform, and our adept management team. Competition in the luxury swimwear industry is based principally on brand image and recognition as well as product quality, innovation, style, distribution, and price. We understand and hold the delicate balance of these factors necessary to find success in our industry.
 
Below are the strengths that differentiate the Company and are viewed internally as critical to our success;
 
Premium Swimwear Brand
 
LSEB aims to be the leading destination for both mens and womens luxury swimwear. We believe customers will associate the LSEB brand with high-quality, premium swimwear that incorporates technically advanced materials, innovative designs, and precise garment construction, providing the best fit for our consumers. We believe our focus on coordinating mens and womens sub-collections differentiates us from competitors and positions LSEB to address a void in the growing market. The nature of our premium brand will be reinforced by our B2C retail strategy and selective distribution through high-end retailers and hotel resort boutiques. We believe this approach allows us to further control our brand image and merchandising.
Distinctive E-Commerce Experience
 
We have designed our website with consumers in mind, focusing on easy navigation, eye-catching visuals, and elaborate product details. By incorporating tactics such as responsive web design, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and advanced Customer Relationship Management system (CRM system), we strive to offer a seamless shopping experience for our customers. These tactics will allow us to gather, organize, and analyze customer information and preferences, helping us cater to each customer and their individual needs.

Innovative Design Process
 
We attribute our ability to develop superior products to a number of factors, including: our customer-driven design process; our collaborative relationships with third-party suppliers and manufacturers to develop finest-constructed and technically advanced products; and our multi-channel retail strategy that allows us to integrate both customer and retailer feedback into our product.
Experienced Management Team
 
Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Lauren Bentley, leads our design team and plays a central role in corporate strategy and promoting our distinctive corporate culture. After graduating from post-secondary school with an Advanced Diploma in Fashion Business Management, she quickly climbed the ladder of her career through hands-on experience, finding employment of various capacities in the fashion industry. Her industry experience includes sales, design, sourcing, distribution, and finance. Ms. Bentley will assemble a management team with a complementary mix of retail, design, operations, product sourcing and marketing experience from leading swimwear and retail companies. We believe our management team will be well positioned to execute the long-term growth strategy for our business.

Inventory / Order Fulfillment / Distribution
 
We plan to utilize our current facility for storage and distribution purposes. This will allow the Company to hold inventory, fulfill orders, and process shipments within one facility, while optimizing space and time. The order fulfillment process entails, checking and monitor for incoming orders (during business hours), verifying product inventory availability and handling any clarifications with customer before charging their credit card. In addition, this same team screens all orders, ensuring the proper verification procedures and specifically ensuring receipt of proper (and fraud-proof) credit card information following our fraud screening steps. All orders placed by credit card are subject to address verification by our credit and fraud avoidance department, which, in some cases, may delay the processing of the order. Orders shipping to an address different from the billing address may require additional information in order to protect consumers against credit card fraud that is overwhelming the internet.
 
We currently operate and will distribute goods from our offices in Miami and in Toronto, Canada. Our facilities are leased or owed by third parties who allow us to utilize the space at no cost.

Terms with Suppliers
 
We carry net 30 day terms with most of our suppliers and in some cases we work on a cash and carry basis where we pay the supplier upfront for a product. In addition, we negotiate separate payment and shipment terms with each supplier.
Website Product Management and Support
 
To streamline operations, we have an in-house team responsible for uploading new products and copy to the LSEB website. This team uploads data files and image feeds manually. Their responsibilities, include categorizing product correctly, guaranteeing that all products, images, and copy information are properly visible and located in correct sub-categories on our website, and making sure that the correct key word search terms are added in our shopping cart for each product.
Customer Inquiry Management
 
The operating team will handle inbound customer calls in the US and Canada during the working hours from 8-8 pm EST. We will begin extended hours and provide support service for International inquiries in the second half of our operating year once we develop quality level standards that are consistent across multiple markets. Said extended services will include a 24-hour global customers handling by phone, email and chat.

Customer - Privacy and Security
 
LSEB has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website;
 
We do not sell customer e-mail address or related information to third parties and unless customers opt-in to our Mailing List they will not receive advertising e-mails from us. We track IP addresses for security reasons to discourage fraudulent activity attempts. By doing so we are making our customer shopping experience more safe and secure.
 
Our site uses cookies to keep track of customer shopping carts for multiple purchases while shopping with us. We do not require our customers to open an account with us in order to shop, therefore each purchase session usually means you may need to re-enter your information.
 
Our sites registration form requires users to give us contact information, such as their name and email address, and unique identifiers. We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about purchases that have been processed. The customers contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary if they have subscribed to the mail list. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by choosing to unsubscribe.
 
Returns
 
We have a general set of standards we use to manage our returns process. Returns are accepted for the full product credit if received within 15 days form the date of purchase. Merchandise returns are not accepted after 15 days from the date of purchase. LSEB provides the customer with a pre-paid delivery slip that can be found inside the package, meaning the customer can send back the products free of charge (hereafter, the Prepaid Slip), by sticking the Prepaid Slip on the return package and depositing it at a post office. No return fees will be refunded by LSEB to the customer if the customer decides not to use the Prepaid Slip that has been made available. Shipping cost refunds will not include reimbursing of the original shipping fees.
 
Each product must be returned new, in its original packaging. If the Product has lost value due to any handling other than to ascertain the nature and characteristics of the Product, LSEB reserves the right to refuse the refund or exchange of the Product. LSEB will not refund orders if any Products returned by the customer do not correspond to those ordered, or if they originate from anywhere other than the LSEB online boutique. Our Close-Out and Special Orders are not returnable.
 
Shipping
 
The shipping department within our warehouse will decide which shipping company to use for each particular shipment. For domestic shipment orders we will ship via FedEx, UPS Ground, United States Postal Service Priority Mail, or Canada Post Priority Mail depending on the size and weight of the order. Small orders generally ship Priority Mail. Large orders generally ship by FedEx. Very small orders, at our discretion, may be sent via First Class Mail with a reduced shipping and handling charge. The absolute minimum shipping and handling charge per order is $9.95.

International Shipments
 
Shipping charges for international orders vary greatly. For international shipping destinations not outlined on our eCommerce website, we have requested that customers email us with the items they are interested in buying with their address and the destination country. We respond to international customers with information on ordering, including shipping and handling charges. Long-term, LSEB is planning to expand its international shipping destination roster, at which time we will partner with FedEx CrossBorder and Mail Forwarding to service a broader range of international customers. FedEx CrossBorder works within a retailers e-commerce platform and shopping cart platform, offering tools to help with regulatory compliance, secure payment processing, multi-currency pricing and credit card fraud protection. As a U.S. e-retailer, selling outside the country will be as simple as a domestic transaction.
Payment Handling
 
For our website business, LSEB has created a PayPal account which will allow us to accept all major credit card providers.
 
Warranties
 
Any other product defects are addressed on a case-by-case basis. Customers can call our Toll-Free telephone number and we will work to resolve their product warranty claims within the first 15 days.
Acquisitions
 
Consolidation Opportunities
 
The Company believes that it will be able to capitalize on the projected growth in the swimwear industry and on consolidation opportunities upon completion of this financing. The industry trends are expected to fuel continued growth, positioning LSEB to advance alongside it.
 
The fragmented nature of the North American swimwear marketplace provides a significant opportunity for LSEB to grow through strategic acquisition of privately operated eCommerce web sites.
 
Criteria and Process of Identification of Acquisitions
 
A strategy of the Company is to pursue opportunities to advance its business through the acquisition of privately operated eCommerce sites. However, there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be identified. The Company may adopt acquisition strategies that require it to seek additional financing. If LSEB is unable to obtain sufficient financing on satisfactory terms and conditions, it may not be able to maintain or increase its market share or expand its business.
 
Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions of Independent Swimwear Brands and ECommerce Sites
 
While LSEBs goal is to be one of the largest swimwear suppliers, the fragmented nature of the marketplace provides a significant opportunity for LSEB to grow through the acquisition of independently operated swimwear lines, stores and e-commerce sites. Management believes the Company will be well positioned to acquire strategic sites from independent and banner operators by offering attractive opportunities to become a partner of the LSEB brand.
 
All potential acquisitions will be evaluated by management of the Company and will be subject to approval by the board of directors of the Company. The Company will pursue acquisitions or developments that meet the Companys objective of acquiring swimwear brands with positive cash flow.
 
Method of Financing Acquisitions
 
The Company proposes to use the proceeds from its offering, bank financing, issuance of treasury shares or other securities, private or public financing, joint venturing of projects or any combination thereof or other means to finance acquisitions. If treasury shares are issued, such issuance could result in a change in control or further dilution to shareholders. The Company aims to limit debt financing for all acquisitions to no more than 40% to 50% of the Common Shares equity.
