Separation from Honeywell

On October 1, 2016, Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”) completed the previously announced separation of AdvanSix Inc. The separation was completed by Honeywell distributing (the “Distribution”) all of the then outstanding shares of common stock of AdvanSix on October 1, 2016 (the “Distribution Date”) through a dividend in kind of AdvanSix common stock, par value $0.01, to holders of Honeywell common stock as of the close of business on the record date of September 16, 2016 who held their shares through the Distribution Date (the “Spin-Off”). Each Honeywell stockholder who held their shares through the Distribution Date received one share of AdvanSix common stock for every 25 shares of Honeywell common stock held at the close of business on the record date of September 16, 2016. We filed our Form 10 describing the Spin-Off with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which was declared effective by the SEC on September 8, 2016 (the “Form 10”). On October 3, 2016, AdvanSix stock began “regular-way” trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the “ASIX” stock symbol. The Spin-Off is further described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Description of Business

AdvanSix Inc. is an integrated manufacturer of Nylon 6, a polymer resin which is a synthetic material used by our customers to produce engineered plastics, fibers, filaments and films that, in turn, are used in such end-products as automotive and electrical components, carpets, sports apparel, fishing nets and food and industrial packaging. As a result of our backward integration and the configuration of our manufacturing facilities, we also sell a variety of other products, all of which are produced as part of our integrated Nylon 6 resin manufacturing process including caprolactam, ammonium sulfate fertilizers, and other chemical intermediates:

• | Nylon – We sell our Nylon 6 resin globally, primarily under the Aegis® brand name. In addition, we use our Nylon 6 resin to produce nylon films which we primarily sell to our customers under the Capran® brand name.


• | Caprolactam – Caprolactam is the key chemical compound used in the production of Nylon 6 resin. In recent years, approximately 60% of the caprolactam we have produced at our facility in Hopewell, Virginia has been shipped to our facility in Chesterfield, Virginia to manufacture Nylon 6 resin. We market and sell the caprolactam that is not consumed internally in Nylon 6 resin production to customers who use it to manufacture polymer resins to produce nylon fibers, films and other nylon products. Our Hopewell manufacturing facility is one of the world’s largest single-site producers of caprolactam as of December 31, 2017.


• | Ammonium Sulfate Fertilizers – Ammonium sulfate fertilizers are derived from the caprolactam manufacturing process. Because of our Hopewell facility’s size, scale and technology design, we are the world’s largest single-site producer of ammonium sulfate fertilizer as of December 31, 2017. We market and sell ammonium sulfate primarily to North American and South American distributors, farm cooperatives and retailers to fertilize crops.


• | Chemical Intermediates – We manufacture, market and sell a number of other chemical products that are derived from the chemical processes within our integrated supply chain. Most significant is acetone which is used by our customers in the production of adhesives, paints, coatings, solvents, herbicides and other engineered plastic resins. Other intermediate chemicals that we manufacture, market and sell include phenol, alpha-methylstyrene (“AMS”), cyclohexanone, methyl ethyl ketoxime (“MEKO”), cyclohexanol, acetaldehyde oxime, 2-pentanone oxime, sulfuric acid, ammonia and carbon dioxide.

Each of these product lines represented the following approximate percentage of total sales:

For information concerning revenues and assets by geographic region, see “Note 16 – Geographic Areas and Major Customers – Financial Data” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K, which information is incorporated here by reference.
Our manufacturing process is backward integrated. We use cumene, a chemical compound produced from benzene and propylene, to manufacture phenol, acetone and AMS, at our Frankford, Pennsylvania plant. The majority of the phenol we manufacture is further processed at our Hopewell facility through an integrated series of unit operations which also consume natural gas and sulfur, to produce caprolactam and ammonium sulfate. In recent years, approximately 60% of our caprolactam is then shipped to our Chesterfield plant, where it is polymerized into Nylon 6 resin. In addition, we use our Nylon 6 resin to produce nylon films at a facility located in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, which we primarily sell to our customers under the Capran® brand name.

Our integrated manufacturing process, scale and the quantity and range of our products make us one of the most efficient manufacturers in our industry. We consistently focus on and invest in improving production yields from our various manufacturing processes to build on our leading cost position. Our global logistics infrastructure enables a reliable intra-plant supply chain and consistent and timely delivery to our customers. In addition, we strive to understand the product applications and end-markets into which our products are sold, which helps us upgrade the quality, chemical properties or packaging of our products in ways to attract price premiums and greater demand.

We serve over 500 customers globally located in more than 40 countries. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had sales of $1,475 million, $1,192 million and $1,329 million with net income of $147 million, $34 million and $64 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our international sales were $286 million, $216 million and $372 million, respectively.

AdvanSix is a single reportable segment, operating through four integrated U.S.-based manufacturing sites located in Frankford and Pottsville, Pennsylvania and Hopewell and Chesterfield, Virginia. The Company's headquarters is located in Parsippany, New Jersey. 
Competitive Strengths
Large-Scale Single-Site Producer of Caprolactam and Ammonium Sulfate. We operate one of the world’s largest single-site caprolactam and ammonium sulfate production facilities, which is a competitive advantage in our fragmented industry. Our scale provides operating leverage and the opportunity to achieve stronger business performance than our competitors in several ways. Most fundamentally, it enables us to spread fixed and overhead costs across more pounds of production, thereby enabling us to produce caprolactam at a lower per pound cost than our competitors, as well as benefiting our procurement activities for raw materials and services. We believe that our reputation as one of the world’s largest producers of caprolactam, Nylon 6 resin, ammonium sulfate and associated chemical intermediates, encourages potential customers to approach us for stability of their supply requirements.

Low Cost Position Driven by Favorable Geographical Location, Integrated Manufacturing Footprint and High Utilization Rates. Our access to lower cost raw materials, backward integrated manufacturing facilities and high plant utilization rates help us maintain our position as the world’s lowest cost producer of caprolactam. First, the location of our manufacturing operations in the United States affords us access to the world’s lowest cost natural gas, which is a key raw material needed to manufacture the ammonia used in the production of caprolactam as well as the source of energy for our manufacturing operations. By contrast, a significant number of our competitors are located in geographic locations where energy prices are substantially higher. Second, we are backward integrated into several key feedstock materials necessary to produce caprolactam and Nylon 6 resin, particularly phenol, ammonia and oleum/sulfuric acid, which we believe is a unique advantage in our industry. Backward integration contributes to higher operating margins by lowering raw material transportation, handling and storage costs. It also allows us to remain flexible, while optimizing sales from our diverse portfolio of products. Finally, our long-term customer relationships and contracts enable us to maintain high plant utilization rates, which, along with our large scale, provide significant operating and purchasing leverage.

Global Reach. The global reach of our sales and marketing capabilities enables us to compete everywhere nylon resin, caprolactam, ammonium sulfate and chemical intermediates are consumed. In 2017, approximately 19% of our sales were outside the United States. Our freight and logistics capabilities and terminal locations position us well to serve global markets, including the dock and loading facility at our Hopewell facility which serves ocean-going freight vessels. Our global reach enables us to arbitrage geographic price variations to ensure we are receiving the highest value for our products.
Technical Know-how, Customer Intimacy and Application Development Capabilities. Intimate knowledge of our customers and end-market applications, combined with our technical know-how, enables us to develop specialty products that are often valued higher by customers compared to commodity products. We have an R&D department consisting of approximately 50 scientists and engineers with advanced degrees in polymer synthesis, catalysis and chemical engineering, who work not only on developing new products for nylon resins but also driving unique offerings for our chemical intermediates and ammonium sulfate customers. Our R&D team has expanded our capabilities to test and scale production of copolymer Nylon 6/6.6 resin, which is used in food packaging films and other applications. We also have R&D resources located in Shanghai, China that specialize in working with nylon resin customers to develop products for specialty applications. Further, our agronomists provide the latest scientific information on the importance of sulfur nutrition for crops and how to optimize the benefits of ammonium sulfate fertilizer to our global customers through a variety of channels including webinars, an “Ask the Agronomist” blog, technical training sessions for retailers and direct grower meetings.
Diverse Revenue Sources from the Sale of Fertilizer, Acetone and Other Chemical Intermediates. Due to our specific chemical manufacturing processes, backward integration and scale, we produce ammonium sulfate fertilizer, acetone and a wide range of other chemical intermediates that enable us to diversify our revenue sources. Most significantly, for every pound of caprolactam produced, we produce approximately four pounds of ammonium sulfate, a fertilizer used by farmers around the world. For the past two decades, we have employed agronomists to educate growers and retailers in the Americas on the yield value of using ammonium sulfate fertilizer on key crops including corn, wheat, coffee, sugar and cotton. Sales of ammonium sulfate in 2017 were $277 million and represented 19% of our total sales. We are among the most significant suppliers of acetone to a variety of end-markets in North America. Sales of acetone in 2017 were approximately $231 million and represented 16% of our total sales. In addition to fertilizer and acetone, other products from our manufacturing process include high-purity phenol, AMS, cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol, sulfuric acid, ammonia, MEKO and carbon dioxide. The diversity of our sales portfolio helps to mitigate, to some extent, the cyclicality in our end-markets.
Business Strategies
Build on our Low Cost Leadership Position. Through our size, access to low cost raw materials, backward integration and high utilization rates, we seek to expand operating margins by reducing our Nylon 6 resin, caprolactam and ammonium sulfate production costs. Our focus on operational excellence and ongoing productivity improvements concentrate on the following:

• | Increasing production volume through asset reliability, flexibility and capacity;


• | Investing in intermediate chemical buffer storage capacity to mitigate the unfavorable impact of routine maintenance and unplanned interruptions;


• | Energy and direct material initiatives aimed at increasing plant productivity and lowering costs; and


• | Procurement processes, competitive bidding and supplier diversification to reduce raw material costs.

Leverage our R&D Investments and Applications Expertise. Our customers typically buy caprolactam and nylon resin for compounding or extruding with additives and other materials, to increase strength or flexibility or to add color to make the resin more suitable for use in their end products such as textiles, packaging and industrial materials. We leverage our R&D investments, customer intimacy and knowledge of product applications to develop new formulations of resin products to better serve our customers and increase the value of our resin products portfolio. For example, engineered plastics that utilize Nylon 6 and Nylon 6.6 resin are being increasingly used in automobiles to reduce weight as automobile manufacturers 
7

strive to meet stricter fuel efficiency standards. We work with our customers serving this market to develop resin products specifically tailored for these product applications. Likewise, we are working to develop and sell nylon resin products with differentiated characteristics for wire and cable applications and flexible food packaging. Another focus of our R&D initiatives includes nylon resin processing technologies that can produce existing high value resins at lower costs. Our R&D team works with existing and potential customers to understand end-use applications, build application development capabilities and protect the value proposition of our new products.
Selective Investments to Produce Higher Value Products. Historically, a significant portion of our Nylon 6 resin was sold as a commodity product and, as a result, was subject to cyclicality. Over the past several years, we have invested in capabilities to increase the value of our product portfolio. We installed a production line at our Chesterfield facility that is capable of producing multiple grades of higher value Nylon 6 resin as well as copolymer Nylon 6/6.6 resin, both of which are used in engineered plastics for the automotive industry, films for food packaging, as well as other higher value applications. Similarly, we will explore other investments that will enable us to produce products that meet customer specifications in certain high value industries.
Use of Toll Manufacturers to Produce Higher Margin, AdvanSix-Developed Specialty Products. We use our technical know-how and customer intimacy to develop products that blend our nylon resin with other types of nylon and non-nylon resin products and additives to produce higher value products. Where we do not have the in-house manufacturing capabilities to produce these products, we contract with third-party compounders to toll manufacture for us. Utilizing third party toll manufacturing has enabled the Company to diversify away from certain commodity end-markets, provide a low cost way to access certain geographic regions and, in some cases, explore new end-markets and applications with less risk.
Pursue a Highly-Selective Acquisition Strategy. We evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to supplement our organic sales by broadening our customer base, expanding our geographic reach and developing our technology and product portfolios. 

Industry Overview

Nylon and Caprolactam. According to PCI Wood Mackenzie, estimated 2017 annual global demand for Nylon 6 resin was approximately 5,500 kMT, spanning a variety of end-uses such as engineered automotive plastics, carpets, textiles, industrial filament, and food and industrial films. The market growth typically tracks global growth but varies by end-use. Some of these end-markets, such as engineered automotive plastics, are experiencing increased demand due to trends in lightweighting to meet stricter fuel efficiency standards. We expect this trend of increasing demand to continue as our customers find new uses for Nylon 6 resin within existing and new applications.

Generally, prices for Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam reflect supply and demand in the marketplace as well as the value of the basic raw materials used in the production of caprolactam, consisting primarily of benzene and, depending on the manufacturing process utilized, natural gas and sulfur. The price of benzene is a key driver of caprolactam prices because it is the common chemical compound used in the petrochemical derivatives, such as phenol and cyclohexane, which are the key feedstock materials for caprolactam depending on the chosen manufacturing technology. As a result, the global prices for caprolactam typically track as a spread over the price of benzene. Generally, Nylon 6 resin prices track the cyclicality of caprolactam prices, although, to the extent Nylon 6 resin producers are able to manufacture specialized nylon resin products, prices set above the spread are achievable.

The global market for Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam has undergone significant change in the past seven years as Chinese manufacturers have entered the market and increased global supply at a time when demand growth has remained relatively stable. As a result of the increased capacity and competitive intensity, margins for Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam have declined to historic lows over this period. Throughout 2017, industry spreads fluctuated near marginal producer cost.

Ammonium Sulfate. Ammonium sulfate fertilizer products are primarily sold in North and South America. Ammonium sulfate is used as a nitrogen fertilizer on key crops that benefit from sulfur micronutrients and, as of December 31, 2017, accounts for approximately 5% of the global market for nitrogen fertilizer. Global prices for ammonium sulfate fertilizer are influenced by several factors including the price of urea, which is the most widely used source of nitrogen-based fertilizer in the world. Urea pricing has declined in recent years due to global production expansions outpacing demand. In late 2017, urea prices firmed as Chinese environmental regulations reduced exports. Another global factor driving demand for ammonium sulfate fertilizer is general agriculture trends including the price of crops.

Chemical Intermediates. Chemical intermediates are used as key inputs for a variety of end-market products including construction materials, paints and coatings, packaging and consumer applications. The prices for our chemical intermediates generally correlate to the prices of their underlying raw materials and supply and demand dynamics.

In 2017, 2016 and 2015, ammonium sulfate sales were 19%, 24% and 25% of our total sales, respectively.
Chemical Intermediates
We produce and sell chemical intermediates to a range of customers for use in many different types of end-products. In 2017, our chemical intermediates generated $487 million of sales, of which $399 million, or 82%, came from sales of acetone, phenol and cyclohexanone, and $88 million, or 18%, came from sales of our other chemical intermediates. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales of chemical intermediates were 33%, 31% and 30% of our total sales, respectively.

Phenol is a key chemical intermediate of caprolactam, and we produce the phenol we use in our caprolactam manufacturing process at our Frankford plant. Approximately 75% to 80% of the phenol we produce is used in production of caprolactam and other chemical intermediates at Hopewell, and approximately 20% to 25% of our phenol is sold to customers for use in their product applications such as resins, epoxies and Bisphenol A.

All our acetone is sold to customers for use in end-products such as adhesives, paints, coatings, solvents, herbicides and other engineered plastic resins. Acetone is typically used by our customers as a key raw material in the production of a variety of other chemicals which are then used in the applications listed above.

We also produce and sell alpha methylstyrene ("AMS"), methyl ethyl ketoxime ("MEKO"), cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol, acetaldehyde oxime and 2-pentanone oxime. We use some of these products in our manufacturing process and sell some to customers for use in end-products such as resins, inks, paints, coatings and agricultural chemical intermediates and detergents.

Raw Materials

9

The primary raw material used in our manufacturing process is cumene, which is produced from benzene and propylene. We purchase cumene from multiple suppliers to ensure stability of supply and optimal terms. Other important raw materials used in our manufacturing process are natural gas and sulfur, which are used to produce caprolactam and ammonium sulfate. We purchase natural gas and sulfur from a diverse set of suppliers.
Historically, we have been able to renew contracts with our suppliers and obtain sufficient quantities of cumene, sulfur, natural gas and any other key raw materials. Global supply and demand can significantly impact the price of our key raw materials, and historically prices have been cyclical. We primarily mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of long-term, formula-based price contracts with our suppliers and formula-based price agreements with customers. We continually seek to reduce costs of key raw materials and do not foresee any material constraints in the near term resulting from pricing or availability.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We have a global sales force with long-standing customer relationships and deep expertise with our products, product applications and end-markets. We predominantly sell directly to our customers, primarily under contracts but also through spot transactions under purchase orders.

Our products are supported by our global logistics capability that we employ to ensure reliable and timely delivery to our customers while maximizing distribution resources and efficiency.

Customers

Globally, we serve over 500 customers in a wide variety of industries located in more than 40 countries. In 2017, the Company's 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of total sales. Our largest customer is Shaw Industries Group, Inc., one of the world’s largest consumers of caprolactam and Nylon 6 resin which we sell to them under a long-term contract. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales to Shaw were 22%, 17% and 16%, respectively, of our total sales. We typically sell to our other customers under short-term contracts, with one- to two-year terms, or by purchase orders. We have historically experienced low customer turnover. 
Seasonality

Except for sales of our ammonium sulfate fertilizer products, which are influenced by seasonal growing patterns in North and South America, sales of most of our products are subject to minimal or no seasonality. We occasionally build up higher inventory balances because the production volumes are generally steady month-to-month rather than tied to seasonal demand for fertilizers.
Backlog

In general, the Company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Therefore, the Company believes that backlog information is not material to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial return. However, we do have long-term supply contracts that carry minimum order obligations.
Research & Development and Intellectual Property

We believe success in our industry is driven not only by operational excellence and cost position but also through technological strength and innovation. Our R&D activities focus on improving our chemical manufacturing processes to increase efficiency, capacity, and productivity, and lowering our production and operating costs, as well as innovating and developing new product applications.

We benefit from numerous patents and trademarks that we own. We sell our Nylon 6 resin under the Aegis® brand name, our nylon films under the Capran® brand name and our ammonium sulfate fertilizer under the Sulf-N® brand name. Chemical intermediates are sold under the brand names of Nadone®, Naxol® and EZ-Blox™. We also benefit from technology covered by trade secrets, including know-how and other proprietary information relating to many of our products, processes and technologies. We do not consider any individual patent, trademark or licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We intend to continue taking steps as necessary to protect our intellectual property, including when appropriate, filing patent applications for inventions that are deemed important to our business.

10

We conduct R&D at technology centers with approximately 50 researchers in total. We lease R&D space from Honeywell in Colonial Heights, Virginia and have R&D resources located in Shanghai, China. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our R&D expenses were approximately $12.9 million, $13.8 million and $12.8 million, respectively.
Regulation and Environmental Matters

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental impact, and any resulting financial liability. Some risk of environmental impact is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.

We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. It is possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws, standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.

Among other environmental laws and regulations, we are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” also known as the “Federal Superfund Law”); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and similar state, foreign and global laws for management and remediation of hazardous materials; the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and the Clean Water Act, for protection of air and water resources; the Toxic Substance Control Act (“TSCA”), for regulation of chemicals in commerce and reporting of potential known adverse effects. There are also numerous other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing materials transport and packaging, under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party liable for cleanup costs associated with current operating sites and various hazardous waste sites.

In July 2013, a consent decree was finalized among the United States, the Commonwealth of Virginia and AdvanSix regarding alleged violations of the CAA and the air operating permit at our manufacturing facility in Hopewell, Virginia. In the consent decree, we agreed to pay a civil penalty of $3 million and, among other things, install certain pollution control and other equipment in accordance with a schedule ending in 2019. In October 2015, a consent order was finalized between the Virginia Water Control Board and AdvanSix regarding alleged violations of Hopewell’s Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit and other discharge requirements. In the consent order, we agreed to pay a civil penalty of $300,000 and, among other things, take corrective action with respect to process sewers and sumps at our Hopewell facility in accordance with a schedule ending in 2018.

Our business may be impacted by potential climate change legislation, regulation or international treaties or accords in the foreseeable future. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.

Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in “Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We continuously seek to improve our environment, health and safety performance. We have expended funds to comply with environmental laws and regulations and expect to continue to do so.

Our Frankford and Hopewell facilities are regulated facilities under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) due to the nature of our operations and the proximity of the facilities to adjacent waterways. As a result, we are required to comply with numerous regulations administered by the Department of Homeland Security, including the development and implementation of compliant security procedures and protocols. Additionally, sales of acetone, which is a List II Chemical under the TSCA, are regulated by the Drug Enforcement Act. This classification subjects us to audits by the Drug Enforcement Administration and ongoing restrictions on our sales activities with respect to acetone.
See “Risk Factors – We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may result in unanticipated loss or liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” in Item 1A.
Employees

As of December 31, 2017, the Company employed approximately 1,510 people. Of this total, approximately 590 are salaried employees and approximately 920 are hourly employees. Approximately 760 employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2018 and 2021.
