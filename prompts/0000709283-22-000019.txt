ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Quantum is a data company with a portfolio of products and services for storing, managing, protecting, archiving, and enriching digital data. We specialize in solutions for video data, images, and other large files because this “unstructured” data represents more than 80% of all data being created, according to leading industry analyst firms. This unstructured data has driven a fundamental shift in the nature of data and the role data plays in every industry. It is exponentially larger than traditional corporate data, contains immense value, and must be captured, protected, and stored for many years, decades, and longer. 
We recognized this fundamental shift in the data landscape, and through a series of strategic acquisitions and internal innovation, we have transformed the company to offer end to end solutions for video and unstructured data. Quantum is a leading provider of cold storage infrastructure to the world’s largest hyperscalers. The world’s leading studios, broadcasters, sports teams, and visual effects studios rely on Quantum to create and archive content. The largest airports, hotels, and critical infrastructure rely on Quantum to capture mission-critical video surveillance data. And many of the world’s leading government agencies, research institutions, and well-known brands everywhere rely on Quantum to store, manage, and protect the data that is at the core of digital transformation. 
Products and Services
Our portfolio of products and services now includes:
•Asset Management and Workflow Orchestration Software to index, analyze, enrich video and image data.
•Primary Storage Systems for high-speed data ingest and capture – optimized for video and images with the fastest streaming performance, and highly available and resilient designs.

CatDV Asset Management Platform and Workflow Orchestration Software
CatDV is an agile asset management and workflow orchestration platform that provides powerful asset management, automation, and collaboration tools for any organization that manages large volumes of digital media. The software application indexes and catalogs video files, digital images, audio files, and other types of files. CatDV helps organizations browse their content and streamline their workflows. CatDV can be used with StorNext file storage, with ActiveScale object storage, as well as third party storage.
StorNext High-Performance File System Software
At the core of our high-performance shared storage product line is our StorNext software that enables high-speed ingest, editing, processing and management of digital video and image datasets. Major broadcasters and studios, post-production companies including streaming services, sports franchises, and corporations around the world use StorNext.
StorNext software is both a shared file system and data management platform. StorNext provides fast streaming performance and data access, a shared file storage environment for macOS, Microsoft Windows, and Linux workstations, and intelligent data management to protect data across its lifecycle. 
StorNext is sold as software based on a subscription licensing model, runs on standard servers, and is sold with storage arrays that are used within the StorNext environment. 
These storage arrays include:
•Quantum F-Series: A line of ultra-fast, highly available non-volatile memory express ("NVMe") storage servers for editing, rendering, and processing of video content and other large unstructured datasets.

•Quantum QXS-Series: A line of high performance storage arrays, offered with either HDD, SSD, or some combination of the two. Customers are now deploying our StorNext file system with a combination of NVMe storage and more traditional SSD and HDD storage to balance cost and performance. 
Our StorNext software can also manage data across different types, or pools, of storage, such as public cloud object stores and disk-based object storage systems. StorNext supports a broad range of both private and public object stores to meet customer needs. For customers that archive video and image data for years, StorNext is also integrated with our tape storage, and can assign infrequently used but important data to tape to create a large-scale active archive.
Solutions for Video Surveillance Recording and Retention
We offer a broad portfolio of products designed for the capture and analysis of video surveillance and security. These products include network video recording servers, as well as hyper-converged storage systems for video surveillance management and recording. In addition, we offer appliances designed for video surveillance analytics and to run different types of access control systems.
Quantum ActiveScale™ Object Storage
With the acquisition of the ActiveScale object storage business from Western Digital that was completed in March of 2020, we now offer leading object storage systems for massive-scale, online content repositories such as media archives, genome sequencing data repositories, and big data lakes. 
ActiveScale object storage provides high levels of data durability and facilitates the management of many petabytes and billions of objects. ActiveScale object storage software is sold via a subscription licensing model, stores data in object format and uses patented erasure-encoding software to protect data across storage nodes and across multiple geographic sites.
DXi Backup Appliances
DXi backup appliances provide high-performance, scalable storage for backup and multi-site disaster recovery. Advanced deduplication technology maximizes data reduction, replication enables multi-site protection and data recovery, and a high-efficiency design enables customers to maximize backup performance while minimizing data center footprint.
Scalar® Tape Storage
Scalar tape storage systems are low-cost, long-term data storage used by large cloud providers and leading enterprises to archive and preserve digital content for decades. The product line scales from entry-level libraries for small backup environments up to massive petabyte and even exabyte scale archive libraries. 
Our tape systems provide storage density, offline secure storage to protect against ransomware and malware, and an intelligent, advanced diagnostics engine designed to reduce downtime and operational expense relative to other tape systems. Our tape systems are used by thousands of enterprises around the world as well as by large cloud service providers. 
In addition to our tape systems, we also sell Linear Tape Open ("LTO") tape cartridges as well as standalone LTO tape drives for small business and desktop use.
Global Support and Services, and Warranty
Our global services strategy is an integral component of our total customer solution. Service is typically a significant purchase factor for customers considering long-term storage for archiving and retention or data protection storage 
solutions. Consequently, our ability to provide comprehensive installation and integration services as well as maintenance services can be a noteworthy competitive advantage to attract new customers and retain existing customers. In addition, we believe that our ability to retain long-term customer relationships and secure repeat business is frequently tied directly to our comprehensive service capabilities and performance.
Our extensive use of technology and innovative product intelligence allows us to scale our global services operations to meet the needs of our customers. We are currently able to provide service to customers in more than 100 countries, supported by 24-hour, multi-language technical support centers located in North America, Europe, and Asia. We provide our customers with warranty coverage on our products. Customers with high availability requirements may also purchase additional services to obtain faster response times on our high-performance shared storage systems, tape systems, and disk backup systems. We offer this additional support coverage at a variety of response levels up to 24-hours a day, seven-days-a-week, 365-days-a-year, for customers with stringent high-availability needs. We provide support ranging from repair and replacement to 24-hour rapid exchange to on-site service support for our midrange and enterprise-class products. In addition to these traditional installation and maintenance services, we also provide project management, managed services, and other value-added services to enhance our customer’s experience and engagement. These incremental services create a deeper relationship with customers that enables them to maximize the value of our solution and better positions us to retain our customers through technology transitions.
We generally warrant our hardware products against defects for periods ranging from one to three years from the date of sale. We provide warranty and non-warranty repair services through our service team and third-party service providers. In addition, we utilize various other third-party service providers throughout the world to perform repair and warranty services for us to reach additional geographic areas and industries to provide quality services in a cost-effective manner.
Research and Development
We compete in an industry characterized by rapid technological change and evolving customer requirements. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to introduce new products and features to meet end user needs. Our research and development teams are focused on technology and services to make our storage systems and data management software easier to manage at scale; software enhancements to make our storage more searchable and accessible, software-defined hyperconverged storage technology, next generation solid-state and hard-drive storage system software, data deduplication and other data reduction technologies, and making tape even more efficient as a storage medium for long term archival storage.
Sales and Distribution Channels
Product Sales Channels
We utilize distributors, value-added resellers ("VARs") and direct market resellers ("DMRs") in our sales process. Our reseller program provides our channel partners the option of purchasing products directly or through distribution channels and provides them access to a more comprehensive product line. Additionally, we sell directly to multiple large corporate entities and government agencies.
OEM Relationships
We sell our products to several original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") customers that resell our hardware products under their own brand names and typically assume responsibility for product sales, end user service and support. We also license our software to certain OEM customers that include this software in their own brand name products. These OEM relationships enable us to reach end users not served by our branded distribution channels or our direct sales force. They also allow us to sell to select geographic or vertical markets where specific OEMs have exceptional strength.
Customers
Our customers vary across multiple industries worldwide ranging from small businesses to global enterprises. In addition, we sell to OEMs, distributors, VARs and DMRs to reach end user customers. Sales to our top five customers represented 17%, 16%, and 23% of revenue in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, of which no customer represented 10% or more of our total revenue.
Competition
The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, characterized by rapid technological change and changing customer requirements. In some cases, our competitors in one market area are customers or suppliers in another. Our competitors often have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, or other resources than we do. Additionally, the competitive landscape continues to change due to merger and acquisition activity as well as new entrants into the market.
As our customers look to use more public cloud storage services, these providers offer a competitive alternative, as well as new platforms and new ways to deploy our software. We expect that the data storage infrastructures of the future will be both hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud, meaning our customers will store their data in the various large public cloud environments, and also want to use services from multiple public cloud vendors.
Our primary storage systems and object storage systems primarily face competition from the EMC business unit of Dell Inc., (“Dell”), International Business Machines Corporation, (“IBM”), NetApp, Inc., (“NetApp”), and other enterprise storage vendors in the markets we serve.
Our tape storage systems primarily compete in the midrange and enterprise reseller and end user markets with IBM and other tape library vendors. Competitors for entry-level and OEM tape systems include BDT Products, Inc. and several others that supply or manufacture similar products. In addition, disk backup products and cloud storage are an indirect competitive alternative to tape storage.
Our backup storage systems primarily compete with products sold by Dell, HPE and Veritas Technologies LLC. 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
Quantum has a global supply chain and operations organization, with contract manufacturers located in the U.S. and Mexico along with supporting third-party logistics companies in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, or (“EMEA”), and the Asia-Pacific region, or (“APAC”). Our supply chain and manufacturing strategy minimizes geo-political and environmental causal risks and provides flexibility to support demand fluctuations by region, further enhancing our variable cost structure.
Quantum primary storage and secondary storage systems are sold as appliances that combine Quantum software with servers that are procured from various server vendors. Quantum sources these servers from various vendors, then uses contract manufacturers for final integration and shipment to customers. Quantum tape storage systems are designed by Quantum and manufactured by a global contract manufacturer. 
Tape media is manufactured in Japan and distributed globally.
The global supply chain environment is constrained, both in terms of server supply and tape drive supply. These shortages are affecting the entire data storage industry, and many industries worldwide, and have resulted in longer lead times, increased costs, and a large backlog. To address these shortages, the supply chain organization is focused on a number of actions including alternate component qualifications, more aggressive management of contract manufacturers, and model changes for better logistics performance and visibility.
Backlog
The global supply constraints have resulted in a historically large backlog, and as of the end of fiscal year 2022, these supply constraints restricted our ability to fulfill all orders. Quantum is carrying a significant backlog of orders heading into fiscal year 2023, and is taking the actions outlined above to draw down this backlog over time while continuing to book new orders. 
Intellectual Property and Technology
We generally rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products. As of March 31, 2022, we hold over 170 U.S. patents. In general, these patents have a 20-year term from the first effective filing date for each patent. We also hold multiple foreign patents and patent applications for certain of our products and technologies. Although we 
believe that our patents and applications have significant value, rapidly changing technology in our industry means that our future success may also depend heavily on the technical competence and creative skills of our employees.
From time to time, third parties have asserted that the manufacture and sale of our products have infringed on their patents. We are not knowingly infringing any third-party patents. Should it ultimately be determined that licenses for third-party patents are required, we will undertake best efforts to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms. See Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies for additional disclosures regarding lawsuits alleging patent infringement.
On occasion, we have entered into various patent licensing and cross-licensing agreements with other companies. We may enter into patent cross-licensing agreements with other third parties in the future as part of our normal business activities. These agreements, when and if entered into, would enable these third parties to use certain patents we own and enable us to use certain patents owned by these third parties. We have also sold certain patents, retaining a royalty-free license for these patents.
We are a member of the consortium that develops, patents, and licenses Linear Tape-Open, (or “LTO® tape”) technology to media manufacturing companies. We receive royalty payments for LTO media technology sold under licensing agreements. We have also entered into various licensing agreements with respect to our technology, patents and similar intellectual property which provide licensing revenues in certain cases and may expand the market for products and solutions using these technologies.
Segment Information
We operate as a single reporting unit and operating segment for business and operating purposes. Information about revenue attributable to each of our product groups is included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and information about revenue and long-lived assets attributable to certain geographic regions is included in Note 2: Revenue and Note 4: Balance Sheet Information, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements and risks attendant to our foreign operations is set forth below in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Seasonality
As is typical in our industry, we generally have the greatest demand for our products and services in the fourth quarter of each calendar year, or our fiscal third quarter. We usually experience the lowest demand for our products and services in the first and second quarters of each calendar year, or our fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal first quarter, respectively.

Work Environment
Competition for talent in the technology industry continues to be aggressive and a candidates’ market. We continue to design, evaluate, and expand our total rewards programs so they remain competitive in attracting, motivating, rewarding, and retaining key talent. 
For the last two years, our focus has been about keeping our employees and office locations safe during the pandemic. We offer flexible and hybrid working arrangements that allow our employees to choose where and how they work. We ensure our work environments, whether onsite or remote, are safe, professional, and inclusive so our employees can be successful. 
To build high performing products and services, we start with building high performing teams that are inclusive, diverse, and respected regardless of gender, race, color, religion, age, sexual orientation, or disability. We invest in diversity hiring and training initiatives as well as performance development opportunities. We seek out candidates anywhere on the career spectrum from intern to a seasoned professional. We hire for energy first, excellence second, and experience last. This past year, we partnered with an outside firm for our annual anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training. The importance of diversity and inclusion is seen and heard from our executive team on a regular basis that includes celebrating diversity internally, promoting equality on social media, and some of our executive management serves as board members for organizations supporting women in leadership and minorities. We believe that having a work environment that is inclusive is a critical component to our culture of excellence.
Culture of Excellence, Accountability, and Innovation
Our company goals and leadership attributes set the tone for our culture of excellence and accountability. Through our Code of Conduct, Culture of Compliance survey, and monthly compliance newsletter, employees are empowered to ask questions, use their voice and report concerns without fear of retaliation. 
Our company culture supports and inspires innovation. Employees are encouraged to seek out new projects or experiences even outside their own working group. The leadership team created regular “no internal meetings” days so employees can have more time to work on innovative projects, plan, take a training course, or use the uninterrupted time for personal development. 
Talent Development 
Our talent is our greatest asset. We are actively growing our employees from a skills and leadership perspective while also retaining our high potential and most critical talent. We offer a worldwide mentorship program that lasts six months in duration and is available to any interested employee. All of our senior leaders participate in the program and get paired with an employee on key developmental skills or behaviors. In addition, we focus our performance reviews on a semi-annual basis in order to closely monitor and discuss our talent successes, needs, and aspirations. Our managers and employees participate in semi-annual discussions that help facilitate conversations of employee contributions, goals and expectations.
