Item 1.Business
​
Overview
​
Teladoc Health, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as “Teladoc Health,” the “Company,” or “we,” and is the global leader in whole person virtual care. We are forging a new healthcare experience with better convenience, outcomes, and value. Our mission is to empower all people everywhere to live their healthiest lives by transforming the healthcare experience. 
​
Teladoc Health was founded on a simple, yet revolutionary idea: that everyone should have access to the best healthcare, anywhere in the world on their terms. Today, we have a vision of making virtual care the first step on any healthcare journey, and we are delivering on this mission by providing whole person virtual care that includes primary care, mental health, chronic condition management, and more.
​
We have developed and built upon our diverse capabilities over the course of nearly 20 years, evolving our product and service portfolio from a suite of point solutions to a whole person offering. We are creating a truly unified and personalized consumer experience, developing technologies to connect patients and extend the reach of care providers, delivering the highest standard of clinical quality at every touchpoint, and enhancing health decisions and outcomes with smart data and actionable insights. Regardless of people’s healthcare needs, across any site of care, we aim to provide the right level of personalized support to meet that need. 
 ​
We believe that we have the largest breadth of integrated whole person products and services in the virtual care industry, capitalizing most recently on our combinations with Livongo Health, Inc. (“Livongo”), which significantly strengthened our chronic care management capabilities, and InTouch Technologies, Inc. (“InTouch”), which expanded our care delivery both inside and outside the hospital. Altogether, this creates a well-defined opportunity for us to treat the whole person, from their mental healthcare to their physical healthcare, and from their acute episodic needs to their chronic needs. Regardless of the healthcare need people come to us with, we strive to be their “front door” to the healthcare system, with a unique ability to connect them to the care, or blend of care, they need. People who come to us with one of these needs are in turn much more likely to rely on us for other healthcare needs, which creates the opportunity for us to build longitudinal relationships, with care that’s personalized for each individual.
​
We aim to achieve our vision of making virtual care the first step on any healthcare journey by delivering, enabling and empowering integrated whole person virtual care services and experiences that span every stage of the healthcare journey. We offer a portfolio of services and solutions covering hundreds of medical subspecialties from non-urgent, episodic needs like flu and upper respiratory infections, to chronic, complicated medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, cancer, congestive heart failure, and mental health conditions – all bolstered by technology, machine learning and human expertise to provide an effective care experience that people value and trust. By combining the latest in data science and analytics with an award-winning user experience through a set of highly flexible integrated technology platforms, we completed approximately 15.4 million telehealth visits in 2021. Additionally, our licensed platform enabled our Clients’ (as defined below) clinicians to provide approximately 4.1 million visits for their patients around the globe in 2021. We possess diverse distribution channels, including Business-to-Business (“B2B”) and Direct-to-Consumer (“D2C”), and we’re a leader in each of them. Our customers consist of employers (including approximately 50% of the Fortune 500), health plans, hospitals and health systems, insurance and financial services companies (collectively “Clients”), as well as individual members. 

​
We are also committed to empowering greater health equity and ensuring that the care we deliver is responsive to individual cultural beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy levels, and communication needs. We also conduct original research on critical topics facing underserved communities, such as the impact of race and gender on chronic conditions, and have launched innovative pilot programs to help us strengthen core services which better meet the unique needs and preferences of LGBTQ+ individuals.
​

As of December 31, 2021, over 53.6 million unique United States (“U.S.”) paid members and 24.2 million visit fee only individuals have access to our high-quality healthcare and expertise through a variety of integrated channels, including 0.7 million members with access to one or more of our chronic care solutions. We provide access to healthcare through our portfolio of consumer brands 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.
​
We believe that favorable existing secular trends in the healthcare industry were accelerated by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, driving greater consumer use of virtual care, and increased adoption by employers, health plans, hospitals and health systems, health care providers, and individuals. In combination with the expansion of our capabilities, we believe that these trends present significant opportunities for virtual healthcare to address the most pressing, universal healthcare challenges through trusted solutions, such as ours, that deliver convenient, affordable, and high-quality care; empower individuals to manage and improve their health; and enable providers to offer their best care for their patients. 
​
During 2020, we completed a $13.9 billion merger with Livongo, the leader in digital chronic condition management solutions for employers and health plans. Livongo brought us capabilities that empower people with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives, including diabetes, hypertension, weight management, diabetes prevention, and mental health. In 2020, we also acquired InTouch, the leader in providing scalable, integrated virtual care solutions to hospitals, health systems, and other provider entities, for aggregate consideration of $1.1 billion.
​
Our 2020 merger with Livongo positions us to offer integrated, comprehensive whole person solutions that we believe will meet the current and future needs of our Clients and members. By bringing together leaders in virtual healthcare and chronic condition management, we believe that the merger combines comprehensive clinical expertise with a rich technology and data-driven experience; prevention and chronic condition management with acute and specialty care; behavior change expertise with data science; global footprint with products meeting global need; access with innovation; and two of the fastest growing companies in health technology. The combined company’s platform features the full range of health support – from artificial intelligence (“AI”) engine-driven “nudges” and health coaches to therapists and board-certified physicians and the world’s leading specialists – available anytime, anywhere to ensure the right care is always delivered. We believe that delivering whole person care as a comprehensive partner with a patient and health system will drive better health and cost outcomes and fundamentally change how patients access and experience healthcare, and the combination of our data scale, technology, and clinical capabilities with the technology and data insights brought to us by the Livongo merger will underpin our ability to deliver differentiated care. We further believe that our significant member scale and the millions of virtual visits we provide each year will increase enrollment and utilization across our solutions as well as amplify overall member engagement and retention.
​
Who We Serve
​
Our Clients purchase our solutions to expand access to convenient, affordable, and high-quality healthcare to their constituents and to reduce their healthcare spending. Our solutions offer our Clients proven substantial savings opportunities and an attractive return on investment. On a direct B2B basis, we sell to our Clients on behalf of their beneficiaries, including employees and health plan members. In our various sales channels, a range of third parties, including health plans, pharmacy benefits managers, financial institutions, brokers, agents, benefits consultants, and resellers, sell our solutions to various end markets around the world. In addition to B2B, we also address the healthcare needs of individuals on a D2C basis across our businesses, most prominently through our BetterHelp brand, as well as through partnerships with other trusted brands.
​
We have over 100 health plan Clients, including some of the largest in the U.S. While health plans are Clients, they also serve as distribution channels to self-insured employers that contract with us through our relationships with the health plan. We serve more than 600 hospital and health system Clients and the self-insured employers that we serve include approximately 50% of the Fortune 500 companies. We also engage with Clients through channel partners such as brokers, resellers, and consultants.
​

How We Generate Revenue
​
We primarily generate revenue on a contractually recurring, access fee basis, typically on a per-member-per-month (“PMPM”) basis. In our D2C business, we primarily generate revenue through monthly member subscriptions. In some cases, Clients primarily pay monthly access fees based on a per-participant-per-month model, based on the number of active enrolled members each month. We also generate revenue from health system and provider Clients related to our licensed technology platform, primarily in the form of recurring access fee revenue as well as from the sale and lease of devices such as robots, carts, and tablets. 
​
Our access fees comprise the majority of our revenue and therefore provide us with significant revenue visibility. We also generate revenue on a per-telehealth visit basis through certain Clients with visit fee only arrangements. 
​
For certain Clients, we also earn visit fees or per-case fees in combination with access fees. Access fee services continue to be the most appealing to our Clients due to the proven effectiveness of our engagement science driving utilization of our services.
​
Access fees are paid by our Clients on behalf of their employees, dependents, policy holders, card holders, beneficiaries, clinicians, or as is the case with certain of our subscribers, fees are paid by our members themselves. Visit fees for general medical and specialty visits are typically paid by Clients and/or members. 
​
For the year ended December 31, 2021, 85%, 13%, and 2% of our revenue was derived from access fees, visit fees, and other, respectively. 
​
The Teladoc Health Brand Portfolio 
​
Our Teladoc Health family of brands – which include, among others, Teladoc, Livongo by Teladoc Health, and BetterHelp, deliver access to advice and resolution for a broad array of healthcare needs, in intuitive, award-winning experiences designed to meet the expectations of today’s consumers, from children to the senior population. The most common way for individuals to engage with our services is by using a mobile device, reflecting the growing consumer adoption of mobile technology and applications in managing their health.
​
Our Competitive Strengths
​
We believe that Teladoc Health is the leading global virtual healthcare provider because of our strong competitive advantages that address the most pressing challenges and trends in the delivery of healthcare around the world. We believe our history of innovation and long-standing operational excellence provide us with significant first-mover advantages, and we continue to invest and expand our services and geographic footprint globally. As the first comprehensive virtual healthcare company providing whole person care at scale, we have pioneered solutions and created what we believe are collectively the telehealth industry’s first and only offerings of their kind.
​
Comprehensive Suite of Virtual Healthcare Clinical Services
​
We believe that we are the first and only company to provide a comprehensive and integrated whole person virtual healthcare solution that both provides and enables care for a full spectrum of clinical conditions, including wellness and prevention, acute care, chronic conditions, and complex healthcare needs. We also provide a broad range of programs and services, including primary and specialty care telehealth solutions, chronic condition management, expert medical services, mental health solutions, and platform & program services.
​

Global Footprint Spanning Clients, Medical Operations and Members
We believe we have the only global virtual healthcare footprint spanning a diverse set of Client channels, medical operations, and members. Combining our suite of international clinical capabilities with our technology and operational scale uniquely equips us to meet the needs of multinational employers.
Unmatched Breadth of Solutions for Clients Across All Channels Served 
​
We deliver a comprehensive set of solutions to a diverse Client population through a highly efficient and effective distribution network wherein we reach Clients and individuals on a direct B2B basis through our Clients and channel partners as well on a D2C basis by marketing our solution directly to potential members. 
​
We believe the breadth of our distribution strategy allows us to directly reach individuals and Clients of nearly every size and in nearly every market. 
​
Comprehensive Engagement Model that Drives Utilization 
​
We believe that our ability to drive behavior change on a global scale to deliver the highest utilization of virtual healthcare services in the industry is a key competitive differentiator for Teladoc Health. We utilize a combination of our proprietary engagement science, our “surround sound” capabilities, personalized individual experiences, as well as our deep knowledge and expertise of various populations to increase the adoption of our virtual care services. 
​
Our engagement science is a unique combination of the application of predictive analytics and modeling, our deep experience with all population demographics, and expertise in applying this knowledge to our Client populations on a global scale. With our proprietary engagement science, we target members using behavioral triggers, advanced predictive modeling, and demographic/firmographic insights. This increases efficiency and the impact of our communications by reaching the right member, with the right personalized message, in the right micro moments of their day-to-day lives. 
​
We believe that our “surround sound” capabilities are unique in the breadth and scale of media mix, analytics, and targeting techniques that we actively deploy across our diverse Client populations on a global scale. We use these capabilities, plus our engagement science, to drive awareness and utilization of Teladoc Health services through innovative media strategies designed to reach members in their homes, on the go and in their moments of need. Our surround sound capabilities and strategies are continuously being evaluated, analyzed, and evolved to meet ever-shifting consumer behaviors.
​
Intelligent, Adaptable and Innovative Solution to Whole Person Care 
​
We have taken an innovative approach to technology to address whole person care. We have fused technology, logistics, mental health capabilities, and clinical science, with data science serving as the intelligent connective tissue that powers our whole person care model. We have a large and unique set of data points that gives us a longitudinal understanding of an individual’s clinical truth and enables us to engage in a holistic stepped care model. We integrate capabilities for our members across health plan, employer, and health system relationships, in a way that we believe is unique in the industry.
​
Highly Scalable and Secure API-Driven Technology Integrated Platform
​
Our core platform is a highly scalable, integrated, application program interface (“API”) driven technology platform, for virtual healthcare delivery, with multiple real-time integrations spanning the healthcare ecosystem.
​
It is equipped to serve over 100 million members and can provide the same level of member support and response time for upwards of 100,000 visits per day. Further, our platform has been built to accommodate the seamless and quick introduction of new clinical and digital services and products. 
​

We leverage and develop a unique combination of cloud-based technology that integrates smart connected devices with sophisticated data science to deliver personalized health insight. For example, we provide a unique and proprietary blood glucose meter to members enrolled in our diabetes program. This patented device, which includes the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA“) Class II certified glucose testing along with a cellular antenna and color touchscreen, is seamlessly integrated with our platform. Our proprietary software relays the blood glucose measurements and user inputs to our cloud service, and then displays targeted communications and AI-selected “nudges” based on the current context and medical history of the member. These communications are dynamically personalized and optimized using our algorithms to deliver improved clinical health outcomes, which drives value to the healthcare ecosystem. The software on the device can also be remotely upgraded through the cellular antenna to deliver usability improvements and program enhancements.
​
Our platform’s APIs power external connectivity and deep integration with a wide range of payors, electronic medical records, third party applications, and other interfaces with employers, hospital systems, and health systems, which we believe uniquely positions us as a long-term partner meeting the unique needs of the rapidly changing, healthcare industry. We are able to white label our solutions, so they fit into the plans and strategies of our Clients, all on a platform that is high performance and highly scalable.
​
Our platform is compliant with numerous international data and privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), data-in-country rules, and other national requirements. This gives us the opportunity and ability to offer our products and services internationally, using the host countries’ languages, currencies, and addressing their specific local needs. We are also able to customize our platform for key partnerships globally.
​
Due to the sensitive nature of our members’ and Clients’ data, we have a heightened focus on data security and protection. We have a rigorous and comprehensive information security program managed by a dedicated team of security engineers and analysts. We have implemented telehealth industry standard processes, policies, and tools through all levels of our software development and network administration, including regularly scheduled vulnerability scanning and third-party penetration testing to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in our system. In addition, our enterprise security program is periodically evaluated by expert third parties to ensure we are meeting or exceeding standards, best practices, and regulatory requirements. One example of such an independent third-party certification that we have achieved is HITRUST CSF.
​
To meet the growing needs of hospitals and health systems, as well as multi-national insurers, our proprietary licensed platform enables Clients to fully integrate private instances of our platform alongside their traditional modes of delivering healthcare to their patients. Leveraging the flexibility and customization available on the platform, most of these implementations incorporate deep integration with the hospital’s or health system’s electronic medical records (“EMR”) platform for scheduling and bi-directional clinical data sharing.
​
Our unique technology designed for the hospital and health system market is a complete end-to-end telehealth solution, including patient intake, emergent and scheduled encounters, video conferencing capabilities, access to medical images, full application-specific clinical documentation tools – including interfaces to health system EMRs, and complete operational and clinical reporting and analytics. The technology also supports industry-leading medical devices such as robots, carts, and tablets via a unique network architecture for maximum performance, reliability, and security. The solution supports the entire patient journey and the full range of telehealth use cases encountered by hospitals and health systems.
 ​
Clinical Capabilities Tailored to Virtual Care 
​
We deliver high-quality clinical care and advice in a virtual setting to our members through the unique mix of our proprietary guidelines, breadth and depth of clinical quality data and analytics as well as through our in-house and third-party medical professionals.
​
​
​

We apply analytics to the anonymized data points generated in our millions of visits with patients to continuously improve the clinical quality of our services. These data sets and insights are applied to enhance our providers’ ability to deliver quality care through tools such as our provider dashboards, as well as serving as a foundation for clinical innovation and collaboration with other leading healthcare organizations that are focused on the advancement of virtual care delivery. 
​
We established The Institute for Patient Safety and Quality of Virtual Care in 2019, the healthcare industry’s first Patient Safety Organization (“PSO”) dedicated to virtual care with the mission of conducting quality and safety initiatives with and on behalf of key healthcare stakeholders, including other PSOs, to improve the delivery of virtual care. This PSO is formally recognized by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and certified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
​
Our Growth Strategies
​
Enable A Virtual First Strategy for Consumer Healthcare Access
​
Our vision is to position virtual care as the first place individuals go to get the care they need and manage their health. For whatever healthcare needs an individual has, across any site of care, we aim to provide the right level of personalized support to meet that need. As we drive the world to a “virtual first” mindset, we believe Teladoc Health has the enterprise scale, technical capabilities, clinical depth, and consumer engagement expertise to achieve this vision. 
​
Teladoc Health’s platform delivers a single solution leveraging our comprehensive clinical expertise, data, and scale, to address the complete spectrum of conditions from non-critical, episodic care to chronic conditions and mental health conditions. The virtual first model is built on our integrated platform, combining smart technologies, AI and machine learning, rich data exchange, digital self-management tools, integrated remote patient monitoring devices, analytics, and scalability to streamline care and drive better outcomes. Our platform matches the expectations of today’s digital consumer by delivering a new kind of healthcare experience that is personalized, convenient, and connected.
​
Expand our Suite of Clinical Services to Address Unmet Needs 
​
We believe that our integrated technology platforms address significant unmet needs, and we intend to continue to expand our solutions across use cases and additional care settings and clinical conditions, including virtual primary care, home care, post discharge follow-ups, wellness/screening, and new areas in chronic care. 
​
Our virtual primary care offering, Primary360, is now available to commercial health plans, employers, and other organizations that sponsor healthcare for individuals and families in the U.S. It addresses persistent challenges in accessing high quality healthcare for millions of individuals, including the one out of four working age adults who do not have a Primary Care Physician (“PCP”), and the four out of five who do not have a strong relationship with a PCP, opening up for us an incremental total addressable market of approximately $140 billion in the U.S. alone. Our strategy is to deliver a reimagined model for primary care, build on a foundation of integrated, multi-source data, leveraging a unified whole person experience; dedicated care team of physicians and non-medical doctors for a personalized longitudinal care plan; continuous guidance and support; navigation and coordination with high quality providers; and “last mile” services like lab testing, prescriptions, and in-home exams. We believe that Primary360 will be an effective gateway to the full range of our services for an individual. We intend to continue to respond quickly to evolving market needs with innovative solutions.
​
With respect to the management of chronic conditions, we have launched both myStrength Complete and Chronic Care Complete. myStrength Complete is an integrated mental health service providing personalized, targeted care to consumers in a single, comprehensive experience. myStrength Complete’s proprietary stepped care model is designed to seamlessly combine app-based tools and coaching expertise with our therapists and psychiatrists to ensure that consumers get the level of mental health support and care they need, when they need it. Chronic Care Complete is a first-of-its-kind chronic condition management solution to help individuals improve their health outcomes while living with multiple chronic conditions. This solution provides members with a unified, comprehensive experience that leverages connected health monitoring devices, access to health coaches and support from physicians and mental health

specialists. Without appropriate care at the right time, chronic conditions can become acute, leading to greater illness and even death. Chronic Care Complete is designed to help people living with chronic conditions improve their health outcomes by providing personalized, high-quality support to address pre-diabetes, diabetes, hypertension, weight management, and mental health concerns.
​
Increase Engagement and Long-term Relationships with Our Members by Driving Expanded Access & Enhanced Touch Points
​
We believe there is significant opportunity within our existing membership base to increase engagement by continually driving awareness of and usage of our solutions. We believe our platform can become the primary entry point for on-demand, virtual healthcare for eligible individuals around the world. We expect to continually refine and enhance our user experience, which is a critical driver of new and repeat engagement, and building longer term relationships with our members, and to continue validating our member satisfaction with surveys and other proactive tools. 
​
Our mobile app is foundational for us as we have redefined virtual healthcare delivery. As we expand the range of products and services available to our members, we are investing in a seamless, relevant, and personalized mobile experience that provides smart guidance for our members. In addition, our integrated smart devices, such as our cellular blood glucose monitor, provide additional touch points for engaging members with relevant AI driven nudges to drive behavior change and improved health outcomes.
​
Our industry leading capabilities and expertise enable unique types of partnerships where our services are delivered to our partners with their brands, logos, and workflows on mobile and web platforms. These integrated member experiences drive higher member engagement, convenience, and utilization. 
​
Expand Penetration of our Suite of Services Among Existing Clients
​
We believe that we offer a highly differentiated suite of solutions for a broad range of market channels, spanning the spectrum of traditional healthcare system participants such as employers, health plans, and health systems as well as global financial services businesses and other organizations. We plan to execute this strategy by selling additional, high value services to our Clients, including our primary care services, chronic condition management programs, and mental health services. We believe that this strategy will help drive an increase in our average revenue per member over time.
​
Within existing Clients, we believe our current membership represents only a portion of the potential members available to us. Our existing health plan Clients and self-insured Clients associated with these health plans currently purchase our solutions for only a portion of their beneficiaries in the aggregate, and we estimate this provides us the opportunity to grow our membership base by expanding our penetration within our existing Clients. We also have substantial room to drive cross-sell opportunities of chronic condition management products into our Client base of telehealth customers, as we see limited overlap of existing Client bases.
​
Leverage Existing Distribution Channels and Expand Penetration of Global Markets
​
We have developed a highly effective and efficient global distribution network. Our international operations are headquartered in Barcelona, Spain with satellite locations in Europe, South America, and Asia. With these locations, we are able to provide 24x7 international services to our members worldwide. When medically necessary, our doctors can help members navigate the local health systems to obtain the best healthcare for their situation. 
​
Our international Client base, largely comprising global financial services companies, provides fertile ground for expansion of our product portfolio through existing partners in attractive markets where our infrastructure is already in place. For instance, we see opportunity for service expansion in global markets through the localization and application of our chronic condition programs for diabetes, hypertension, weight management, diabetes prevention, and mental health. We also see opportunity for marketing our Solo solution in international markets, supporting the needs of government health systems and hospitals, as well as private entities.

​
Drive Direct-To-Consumer Channel Growth
​
We plan to continue driving growth through investments in our D2C channels, which include mental health and general medicine as well as partnerships with Telefonica in Spain, Vivo in Brazil, and CVS Minute Clinic in the U.S. Relative to our mental health capabilities, BetterHelp is the leader in the D2C therapy market, both in terms of the number of individuals enrolled and the number of providers who provide services on the platform. The scale of our data and provider network, powered by our data science capabilities, creates a competitive advantage for us in providing an optimal match of an individual with a provider, increasing the rate of success in therapy. We leverage diverse customer acquisition channels and increased organic sources of traffic, which reduces dependence on any single source of member acquisition. Even with our strong historical growth, we believe there is substantial untapped growth potential, both domestically and internationally, as almost half of BetterHelp members have never sought therapy before. 
​
Expand Through Focused Investments and Acquisitions
​
We plan to continue to support our overall strategy and market leadership with selective investments and acquisitions. To date, we have completed multiple acquisitions that have expanded our distribution capabilities, broadened our service offering, and created a broad global footprint. Our acquisition strategy is centered on acquiring products, capabilities, clinical specialties, technologies, and distribution channels that are highly scalable and rapidly growing. We have also established a track record of integrating these acquisitions to deliver incremental value to our Clients and members. 
​
Sales and Marketing
​
We sell our services principally through our direct sales organization. Our direct sales team comprises enterprise focused sales professionals, who are supported by a sales operations staff, including product technology experts, lead generation professionals, and sales data experts. We maintain relationships with key industry participants including benefit consultants, brokers, group purchasing organizations, health plans, and hospital partners.
​
We generate Client leads, accelerate sales opportunities, and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target human resource, benefits, and finance executives in addition to technology and health professionals, senior business leaders, and healthcare channel partners. Our principal marketing programs include use of our website to provide information about our company and our solutions, as well as learning opportunities for potential members; integrated marketing campaigns; and participation in industry events, trade shows, and conferences.
 ​
Research and Development
​
Our ability to compete depends, in large part, on our continuous commitment to rapidly introduce new products, services, technologies, features, and functionality. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in research and development and acquisitions to enhance our existing solutions and introduce innovative products and capabilities. Our multi-disciplinary team includes a product development team responsible for the design, development, testing, and certification of our solutions. It also includes software engineering teams responsible for solution development and deployment, and a data science team providing the insight that powers our differentiated health actions. We continuously focus on developing new products and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance, and flexibility of our solutions.
​
Competition
​
We view as our competitors those companies that currently (or in the future will) (i) develop and market virtual care technology (devices, software, and systems) or (ii) provide virtual care services, such as the delivery of on-demand access to healthcare and chronic condition management. Competition focuses on, among other factors, experience in operation, customer service, quality of technology and know-how, and reputation. Competitors in the telehealth and expert medical services market include MDLive, Inc. (now owned by Cigna), American Well Corporation, Included Health, and Accolade, Inc., among other smaller industry participants. In the digital chronic condition management

market, competitors include Omada Health, Inc., Virta Health Corp., and other participants. In the market for technology solutions for hospitals and health systems, competitors include American Well Corporation and MDLive, Inc., as well as smaller technology providers. In the D2C mental health market, competitors include Talkspace and Cerebral, and other participants. We also face competition from large, well-financed health plans that in some cases have developed their own virtual care, expert medical service or chronic condition management tools, as well as large technology and retail companies, such as Amazon and Walmart, which have developed or acquired their own virtual care solutions.
​
Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A.
​
We contract for the services of our telehealth provider network through a services agreement with Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A. formerly Teladoc Physicians, P.A. (“THMG”). We do not own THMG, which is a 100% physician owned independent entity, or the professional corporations with which it contracts. Instead, THMG and the professional corporations (collectively, the “THMG Association”) are owned by physicians licensed in their respective states. Under the services agreement with THMG, we have agreed to serve, on an exclusive basis, as manager and administrator of THMG’s non-medical functions and services related to the provision of the telehealth services by providers employed by or under contract with THMG. The non-medical functions and services we provide under the services agreement primarily include member management services, such as maintaining network operations centers for our members to request a visit with THMG’s providers, member billing and collection administration, and maintenance and storage of member medical records. THMG has agreed to provide our members, through its providers, access to telehealth services and recommended treatment 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The services agreement also requires THMG to maintain the state licensure and other credentialing requirements of its providers. Under the services agreement, THMG currently pays us an access fee of $65,000 per month for network operations center and medical records maintenance, fixed fees of approximately $1,815,000 and $1,151,000 per month for our provision of management and administrative services and marketing expense, respectively, and a license fee of $10,000 per month for the non-exclusive use of the Teladoc Health trade name. The services agreement has a 20-year term and expires in February 2025 unless earlier terminated upon mutual agreement of the parties or unilaterally by a party following the commencement of bankruptcy or liquidation proceeds by the non-terminating party, a material breach of the services agreement by the non-terminating party, or a governmental or judicial termination order related to the services agreement. The THMG Association is considered a variable interest entity and its financial results are included in Teladoc Health’s consolidated financial statements.
​
Regulatory Environment
​
Our operations are subject to comprehensive United States federal, state and local, and comparable multiple levels of international regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules continue to expand and become more restrictive each year and are subject to frequent change. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers, to maintain all necessary licenses and to operate in compliance with applicable laws and rules. Those laws and rules continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare and medical practice regulation. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In many jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations. 
​
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, state and federal regulatory authorities have reduced or removed a number of regulatory requirements in order to increase the availability of telehealth services. For example, many state governors have issued executive orders permitting physicians and other health care professionals to practice in their state without any additional licensure or by using a temporary, expedited, or abbreviated licensure process so long as they hold a valid license in another state. In addition, changes were made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs (through waivers and other regulatory authority) to increase access to telehealth services by, among other things, increasing reimbursement, permitting the enrollment of out of state providers, and eliminating prior authorization requirements. It is uncertain how long these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect and whether they will continue 

10



beyond this public health emergency period. We do not believe that our operations or results will be materially adversely affected by a return to the status quo from a regulatory perspective.
​
For additional discussion of our regulatory environment, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Telehealth Provider Licensing, Medical Practice, Certification and Related Laws and Guidelines
​
The practice of medicine, including the provision of mental health services, is subject to various federal, state, and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, and approvals, relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, the practice of medicine (including the provision of remote care and cross coverage practice), equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication. The application of some of these laws to telehealth is unclear and subject to differing interpretation. Physicians, physician assistants, advanced practice registered nurses, nurses, and mental health professionals who provide professional medical or mental health services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine or to provide mental health treatment in the state in which the patient is located. We have established systems for ensuring that our affiliated physicians and mental health professionals are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our members occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in our services being found to be non-reimbursable or prior payments being subject to recoupments and can give rise to civil or criminal penalties.
​
U.S. Corporate Practice of Medicine; Fee Splitting
​
We contract with physicians or physician-owned professional associations and professional corporations to deliver our U.S. telehealth services to their patients. We frequently enter into management services contracts with these physicians and physician-owned professional associations and professional corporations pursuant to which we provide them with billing, scheduling, and a wide range of other services, and they pay us for those services out of the fees they collect from patients and third-party payors. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws, including those of New York, Texas, and California, that prohibit fee splitting or the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment. In addition, various state laws also generally prohibit the sharing of professional services income with nonprofessional or business interests. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. Under the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of certain states, decisions and activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates, and the hiring and management of non-clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine.
​
State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws vary from state to state and are not always consistent among states. In addition, these requirements are subject to broad powers of interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our engagement of a provider licensed in the state or the provision of telehealth to a resident of the state. However, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our providers, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee splitting. In this event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our providers, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our Providers that interfere with our business and other materially adverse consequences.
​
U.S. Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
​
Federal Stark Law
​
We are subject to the federal self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. Where applicable, this law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients to an entity providing “designated health services” if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a “financial relationship” with the entity, unless an 

11



exception applies. The penalties for violating the Stark Law include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services, civil penalties of up to $26,125 for each violation, and twice the dollar value of each such service and possible exclusion from future participation in the federally funded healthcare programs. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions may be fined up to $174,172 for each applicable arrangement or scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes, including the Stark Law can be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act (described below) based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
​
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
​
We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly worded and prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, or (iii) the purchasing, leasing, or ordering or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if “one purpose” of a payment is to induce referrals. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation, making it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the requisite state of mind or “scienter” required for a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, as discussed below. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, including civil monetary penalties of up to $105,563, and criminal fines of $100,000 per violation, and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration, and imprisonment of up to ten years. Imposition of any of these remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) has published safe-harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG.
​
False Claims Act
​
Both federal and state government agencies have continued civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies and their executives and managers. Although there are a number of civil and criminal statutes that can be applied to healthcare providers, a significant number of these investigations involve the federal False Claims Act. These investigations can be initiated not only by the government but also by a private party asserting direct knowledge of fraud. These “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits may be initiated against any person or entity alleging such person or entity has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government or has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, the improper retention of an overpayment for 60 days or more is also a basis for a False Claim Act action, even if the claim was originally submitted appropriately. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $11,803 to $23,607 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare programs. In addition, some states have adopted similar fraud, whistleblower, and false claims provisions.
​

State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
​
Several states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have also adopted or may adopt similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary by jurisdiction and are enforced by local courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any payor, including patients and commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
​
Other Healthcare Laws
​
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their implementing regulations, (collectively, “HIPAA”), established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non-governmental payors of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund an overpayment. These provisions are intended to punish some of the same conduct in the submission of claims to private payors as the federal False Claims Act covers in connection with governmental health programs.
​
In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties associated with the wrongful act. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The OIG emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts, and statutory or common law fraud.
​
Foreign and U.S. State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
​
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personally identifiable information (“PII”), including health information. In particular, HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”) and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. The THMG Association, our Providers, and our health plan Clients are all regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. Since the effective date of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule on September 23, 2013, HIPAA’s requirements are also directly applicable to the independent contractors, agents, and other “business associates” of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI in connection with providing services to 

13



covered entities. We are also at times a business associate of other covered entities when we are working on behalf of our affiliated medical groups.
​
Violations of HIPAA may result in significant civil and criminal penalties, and a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. Our management responsibilities to the THMG Association also include assisting it with its obligations under HIPAA’s breach notification rule. Under the breach notification rule, covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which has more than a low probability of compromising the privacy, security, or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to the HHS and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. The regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities, and others.
​
State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts.
​
Many states in which we operate and in which our patients reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to, or even more protective, and apply more broadly than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) protects the personal information of California consumers regardless of the location of the business holding the information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA or apply more broadly than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject. And numerous states are currently reviewing legislation that is similar to the CCPA. For example, Virginia passed the Virginia Consumer Data Protect Act in March 2021, which becomes effective on January 1, 2023, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act in July 2021, which becomes effective on July 1, 2023. We expect that states will continue to focus on enacting similar privacy laws. 
​
In addition to HIPAA and state information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal laws, including laws that prohibit unfair and deceptive practices which may include deceptive statements about privacy and security policies and practices. 
​
In recent years, there have been a number of well publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of PII and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. 
​
We are also subject to laws and regulations in non-U.S. countries covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. European Union (“EU”) member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure, processing, and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, contact information, and sensitive personal data such as health data. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time.

14



​
The GDPR imposes many requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals, and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric, or health data. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €10,000,000 or up to 2% of the total worldwide annual revenue from the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties.
​
We are also subject to EU laws on data export, as we may transfer personal data from the EU to other jurisdictions, in particular the United States. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. In addition, these rules are constantly under scrutiny. For example, following a decision of the Court of Justice of the EU in October 2015 (commonly referred to as the Schrems I), transferring personal data to U.S. companies that had certified as members of the U.S. Safe Harbor Scheme was declared invalid. In July 2016, the European Commission adopted the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield Framework which replaced the Safe Harbor Scheme. However, the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield Framework was also declared invalid by the Court of Justice of the EU in July 2020 (commonly referred to as Schrems II). While Schrems II affirmed the validity of corporate binding rules and standard contractual clauses as legal bases to transfer EU data to the United States, it also put into place stricter requirements for transfers based on standard contractual clauses.
​
Some countries outside the EU have adopted laws that are similar to the EU GDPR. For example, Brazil adopted the Brazilian General Data Protection Law, which is closely aligned with the EU GDPR and began to be enforced in August 2021. Additionally, China adopted the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), which also closely aligns with GDPR, although there are differences. PIPL went into effect on November 1, 2021. 
​
International Regulation
​
We expect to continue to expand our operations in foreign countries through both organic growth and acquisitions. Our international operations are subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by jurisdiction, including anti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate governance, privacy, data protection (including GDPR), data mining, data transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection, and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures; required localization of records and funds; and limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital. In addition, the expansion of our operations into foreign countries increases our exposure to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering provisions of U.S. law, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), and corresponding foreign laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the “U.K. Bribery Act”).
​
The FCPA prohibits offering, promising, or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. We also are subject to applicable anti-corruption laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and the DOJ have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The U.K. Bribery Act is an anti-corruption law that is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to all companies with a nexus to the United Kingdom. Disclosures of FCPA violations may be shared with the UK authorities, thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions. We have internal control policies and procedures and conduct training and compliance programs for our employees to deter prohibited practices. However, if our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing our international operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions, and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies, and criminal sanctions. 
​

15



We also are subject to regulation by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States. In addition, we may be subject to similar regulations in the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate.
​
Human Capital Management
​
At Teladoc Health, we live our values as a company through policies, governance, and deliberate investment in operating responsibly and sustainably. We are committed to making a positive impact in society and, perhaps even more importantly, to encourage others of like mind and spirit to join us in this critical work.
​
To fulfill our mission, we are focused on building a great company that becomes a global destination for amazing talent who want to build their careers, develop their capabilities, and grow both professionally and personally. We design a range of programs and initiatives to nurture talent, encourage curiosity and innovation, make room for diverse voices and perspectives, increase engagement and connectiveness, and mentor leaders for future roles. We build a range of total reward programs that support employees through fair, equitable, and competitive pay and benefits, and we invest in technology, tools, and resources to transform and increase the quality of work.
​
The Company employed approximately 5,100 people as of December 31, 2021. Our global workforce is comprised of approximately 85% full time employees and 15% part time employees. In addition, we augment our employee base with contractors to meet resource needs and to increase flexibility in managing our expense base. Of the total employee population as of December 31, 2021, approximately 64% of our employees worked in the U.S. and 36% worked in our international locations. Through the THMG Association and our D2C mental health platform, we also contract with a network of providers. In order to ensure predictable availability of providers and a consistent member experience, we expect that THMG will hire more providers and rely less on contractors.
​
We continue to look for ways to expand a range of programs and initiatives that are focused to attract, develop and retain our workforce – including a focused engagement through diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”). We have enhanced our efforts in recent years to include: 
​
Supporting Employees through Our Products and Services. We offer full access to our portfolio of solutions to our employees, including free mental and mental health resources, digital health devices, and on-demand access to the employee assistance program for employees and their dependents.
​
Talent Development. We prioritize and invest in creating opportunities to help employees grow and build their careers, through training and development programs. These include online and self-paced courses, live in-class education, professional speaker series, peer-to-peer learning, certification programs, and on-the-job training, as well as executive talent and succession planning paired with an individualized development approach.
​
Expanding the Voice of the Employee. We strive to build a culture of soliciting employee feedback through our pulse engagement surveys and listening circles and seeking opportunities to advance employee feedback.
​
Diversity Council. We continue to drive the Teladoc Health diversity council, a group of senior leaders from throughout the organization that champions ongoing dialogue and engagement with our teams. This group has reported its work and findings annually to our board of directors since 2018.
​
Equal Pay Study. In 2021, we completed a refreshed global organization-wide pay equity study to help ensure that compensation reflects our prioritization of gender and racial equity, and we are actively addressing any gaps in compensation and are committed to a recurring periodic review going forward.
​
Open Dialogue to Encourage Diverse Thinking and Voices. In 2020, we launched the “Courageous Conversations Series” as an instrument for unearthing opportunities for discussion through effective dialogue across 

16



topics that intersect or singularly focus on impacting DEI. In 2021, we expanded our Courageous Conversations to include a series of guest speakers to engage in a range of topics and foster ideas for improving our inclusive culture.
​
Business Resource Groups. In 2021, we expanded our business resource groups (“BRGs”), which we believe are a foundational element of the DEI ecosystem. Our seven BRGs, with more than 1,100 active members globally, include a focus on LGBTQ, women, multicultural, military veterans, neurodiversity and differing physical and mental abilities, and generational interests of employees who are engaged in four key pillars:
​

• | Building internal community/network
--+------------------------------------

​

• | Advancing external community
--+-----------------------------

​

• | Supporting business impact
--+---------------------------

​

• | Enhancing professional development
--+-----------------------------------

​
Focusing on diversity recruiting and talent acquisition. We broadened our diversity hiring manager training resources for performance-based interviewing, which included a screening tool to promote gender-neutral job descriptions and expanded our corporate and college/university partnerships to advance our pipeline of diverse talent.
​
Community Impact. We embrace the opportunity and the responsibility to have a meaningful impact in our global community, using our voice and our resources to help expand equitable access to care, and create a better future for families and our neighbors. Our efforts in 2021 represented a strong start to the greater impact we are poised to have in our communities. As we move into 2022, we look forward to expanding our efforts working toward further mobilizing our workforce to give back to the communities where we live and work through new volunteer programs and corporate matching opportunities for giving. 
​
We set out to advance positive social change in our communities by volunteering more than 10,000 hours around the globe in 2021 – a goal we exceeded by more than 20%. This was an ambitious goal that was consistent with our values, including those of respecting and taking care of people, doing what’s right, and succeeding together. For 2022, we have increased our goal to 15,000 volunteer hours.
​
Intellectual Property
​
We own and use trademarks and service marks on or in connection with our services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in the United States and around the world. We also have trademark applications pending to register marks in the United States and internationally. In addition, we rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties and on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets, know-how, and other unpatented proprietary processes and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. We require our employees, consultants, and certain of our contractors to execute confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement while using our property or which relate to our business.
​
Seasonality
​
We typically experience the strongest increases in consecutive quarterly revenue during the fourth and first quarters of each year, which coincides with traditional annual benefit enrollment seasons. In particular, as a result of many Clients’ introduction of new services at the very end of the current year, or the start of each year, a concentration of our new Client contracts has an effective date of January 1. Therefore, while membership increases, utilization is dampened until service delivery ramps up over the course of the year. Additionally, our business has become more diversified across services, channels, and geographies. We continue to see a diversification of Client start dates, resulting 

17



from our health plan expansions, cross sales of new services, international growth, and mid-market employer growth, all of which are not constrained by a calendar year start.
​
As a result of national seasonal cold and flu trends, we typically experience our highest level of visit fees during the first and fourth quarters of each year. Conversely, the second quarter of the year has historically been the period of lowest utilization of our provider network services relative to the other quarters of the year. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 and 2020, we did not experience the typical seasonality associated with national cold and flu outbreaks. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry —Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
