ITEM 1. Business
OVERVIEW
 
Salon is a technology-based advertising media business that wholly owns and operates an online news website, salon.com (“Salon.com”). Our award-winning journalism is committed to fearless journalism and combines original investigative stories and provocative personal essays along with quick-take commentary, articles, podcasts, and original video about politics, culture, entertainment, sustainability, innovation, technology and business.
 
Salon was originally incorporated in July 1995 in the State of California and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1999.  In 1999, we had our initial public offering.  In 2001, we adopted the name Salon Media Group, Inc. In March 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of our assets. Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets and our stock symbol is SLNM.
 
Material Agreements Entered into during Fiscal 2019 and First Quarter of Fiscal 2020
 
Asset Purchase Agreement 
 
On March 6, 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Salon.com, LLC (“Buyer”) under which we agreed to sell substantially all of our assets (the "Asset Sale"), including all pertinent intellectual property rights comprising the Company’s business of owning, operating and publishing the website known as Salon.com, (the “Business”), but excluding our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and certain contracts and right related to those contracts and tax refunds and insurance policies and rights related to excluded assets, to the Buyer for an aggregate Purchase Price of $5 million payable plus the amount of the Earn-Out Payment (as described below) and the assumption of certain assumed liabilities, all pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The purchase price is payable in cash as follows: (i) $550,000 in payable in cash at closing; (ii) $100,000 shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent, which amount shall be released to us in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement; (iii) $500,000 of which was previously paid to the Company as a deposit concurrent with execution of the term sheet for the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Deposit") and (iv) $3,850,000 via issuance of a 10% secured promissory note, which note shall be paid in 2 equal installments on the 12 month and 24 month anniversary of the closing date. This note shall be secured by all of the assets being sold to Buyer under the Asset Purchase Agreement.

First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement
 
On April 15, 2019, we entered into a First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement ("First Amendment") with Buyer. The primary purpose of the First Amendment was to amend the payment terms under the Technology Agreement and the Advertising Agreement as set forth below:
 
(a) for the month of March 2019: (i) ad fees under the Advertising Agreement shall be payable at 6.5%, and (ii) tech management fees payable pursuant to the Technology Agreement shall be $5,000 plus costs per the Technology Agreement;
 
(b) for the month of April 2019: (i) ad fees under the Advertising Agreement shall be payable at 6.5%, and (ii) tech management fees payable pursuant to the Technology Agreement shall be $10,000 plus costs per the Technology Agreement; and
 
(c) for the month of May 2019 and for each month thereafter: (i) ad fees under the Advertising Agreement shall be payable at 6.5%, (ii) tech management fees payable pursuant to the Technology Agreement shall be $10,000 plus costs per the Technology Agreement and (iii) an amount equal to 10% APR applied to the Deposit.
 
We also amended Section 10.9 of the Asset Purchase Agreement to include the term sheet related to the acquisition for the documents related to the entire agreement of the parties.
 
Second Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement
 
On June 30, 2019, we entered into a Second Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement with Buyer under which the parties revised the Asset Purchase Agreement to provide that amounts delivered into escrow upon execution would not be used to compensate any Buyer Indemnified Parties for any losses under the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Settlement Agreements with Jordan Hoffner and Elizabeth Hambrecht
 
On July 1, 2019, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release with each of Jordan Hoffner, our former CEO and Elizabeth Hambrecht, our former CFO. Under the terms of each agreement, we agreed to pay Mr. Hoffner and Ms. Hambrecht, as applicable, the total sum of Thirty Thousand dollars ($30,000.00) (the “Settlement Payment”) on the earlier of (i) 2 business days after the Closing of that certain Asset Purchase Agreement and (ii) December 31, 2019 (the “Payment Date”). Each of Mr. Hoffner and Ms. Hambrecht Claimant acknowledges that, upon receipt of the Settlement Payment, they will have been paid all wages, severance, all unreimbursed business expenses, and all accrued but unused vacation pay due and owing to them further waived any additional claims for unpaid salary or wage amounts, unreimbursed business expenses, and accrued but unused vacation pay. Each of Mr. Hoffner and Ms. Hambrecht executed a general release of all claims under their respective agreements.
 
Advances/Secured Notes from Related Parties
 
From June 2018 through August 2018, we received $114,500 in advances from related parties. These advances accrued interest at a rate of 10% per annum and payable on the one-year anniversary of such advances. On December 7, 2018, these advances and all accrued interest were exchanged for secured notes in the amount of approximately $118,899. These notes bear a 10% interest rate and are payable on June 30, 2019. In addition, on December 7, 2018, we issued warrants to the secured note holders to purchase 11,312,600 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The warrants expire five years from the issuance date and can be exercised with cash or cancellation of the secured notes referenced above.

Technology Support Agreement
 
On October 25, 2018 we entered into a Technology Support Agreement (the "Technology Agreement") with PubLife LLC under which PubLife agreed to provide certain technology support to us, including all web development activities for a six month term in consideration of $1,000 per month. The payment terms under this agreement were amended under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement (as set forth below).
General Advertising Services Agreement
 
On October 25, 2018, we entered into a General Advertising Services Agreement (the "Advertising Agreement") with Proper Media LLC ("Agent") under which we retained Agent to provide advertisement sales and trafficking services for our websites, including salon.com and related sites. The term of this agreement is for one -year, which term shall be extended for successive one-year periods under terminated by either party within 30 days’ notice prior to the end of any term. We agreed to pay agent its revenue share of all revenue invoiced by Agent in connection with Agent's performance of the services under this agreement. In addition, if we refer a 3rd party publishing partner and Agent executes an advertising services agreement with such 3rd party, Agent agrees to pay us 25% of the monthly revenue earned by Agent due to such 3rd party agreement for the first six-months of any such agreement. The payment terms under this agreement were amended under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement (as set forth below).
 
WGAE Agreement
 
In October 2018, we entered into an agreement with the WGAE for a three-year period.  As a result of the ongoing negotiations and accompanying legal fees as well as the higher cost structure per the negotiated agreement, the effect was detrimental to the company’s financial standing as we had to endure layoffs of management in order to accommodate the editorial staff.  In addition, the agreement with the union had a seemingly negative impact on our ability to obtain additional financing. 
 
Highlights from Fiscal Year 2019
 
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 (“fiscal year 2019”), we continued to execute our business strategy to refine and broaden our editorial products in order both to attract an engaged audience and premium advertising, which would increase revenues. However, now that the landscape for publishers has permanently changed, we faced increased competition from both new and larger websites for online advertising campaigns during the year, and in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, significant changes to the algorithms used by Google and Facebook led to sharp decreases in traffic.  Despite changes to our advertising footprint to capture the greater programmatic opportunity for our display and video advertising inventory, and resulting higher CPMs from our programmatic advertising compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 (“fiscal year 2018”), the reduced traffic led to a smaller ad footprint and suppressed our revenues. In addition, in March 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of our assets.  Upon consummation of this transaction, if consummated, we will cease to be an operating company. The highlights of our fiscal year 2019 relating to current operations are listed below:

● | Total revenue in the fiscal year 2019, as it related to discontinued operations, decreased 33% to $3.0 million, compared to $4.5 million in the fiscal year 2018. We have been working on strategies to better monetize our Website and increase advertising revenues per session. A continued significant industry shift in online advertising from advertising sold by a direct sales team to advertising being sold through software-based “programmatic” technology has taken place. Our advertising sold through networks that access these programmatic buys accounted for 72% of our advertising revenue for the fiscal year 2019. We have been making changes to our advertising footprint to capture the greater programmatic opportunity for our display and video advertising inventory, and we will continue to focus our efforts to allow better management of our advertising inventory and targeting for our advertisers.

● | Net loss for the fiscal year 2019 was $2.7 million, a 13% decrease from $3.1 million in the fiscal year 2018. This included a net loss from continuing operations for the fiscal year 2019 of $2.8 million, a 4% increase from $2.7 million in the fiscal year 2018. Net income from discontinue operations for the fiscal year 2019 was $0.2 million compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of $0.4 million for fiscal year 2018.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have continued to roll out our strategy to produce original video content focused on news, politics, and entertainment under the banner of Salon TV, Salon Talks and Salon Stage. Our goal is to add high quality diversified content to our Website, and to attract premium video advertising that commands higher CPMs as compared to display advertising. Featured guests on Salon Talks have included Senator Doug Jones, Janet Napolitano, Stacey Abrams, Matthew Broderick, Kathy Griffin, Jesse Eisenberg and Tina Brown. Furthermore, to monetize our growing library of nearly one thousand episodes of original video programming, we have been distributing our video programming across key Over-the-Top (OTT) channels such as Apple TV, Amazon and Roku.

● | Our peak monthly users for Salon.com traffic in fiscal year 2019 was in November 2018 when we recorded 7 million users, as measured by Google Analytics. In total, the average number of monthly users in fiscal year 2019 was 6.2 million, compared to 10.6 million in fiscal year 2018, a decrease of 41%. We attribute the decline in overall traffic to a combination of events, including the changes in the algorithms used by Facebook to promote news content, which led to lower referral traffic from Facebook, and reduced referral traffic from other major websites like Yahoo and Twitter. Our focus on growing traffic has shifted from volume to quality, in order to maximize our ability to monetize our page views with higher CPM video and display advertising. In order to achieve that, we made changes to our editorial mix in order to publish more content in the categories of Food, Science, Innovation and Health that attract higher CPMs, such as pre-roll video and native advertising.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook and referral traffic from other websites continue to be major drivers of traffic, at approximately 34.6% of Website visitors as of March 2019. In fiscal year 2019, we made a concerted effort to increase the number of platforms to distribute Salon content so that we can be less reliant on Facebook’s volatility in traffic. New traffic partners include Quora, LinkedIn, Smartnews, News360 and Flipboard. As a result, we increased our social media followers 9% from 2.0 million in 2018 to 2.2 million in 2019.

● | In August 2015, Salon initially recognized the Writers Guild of America, East, Inc. (“WGAE”) as the collective bargaining representative of our non-supervisory editorial staff. In October 2018, we entered into an agreement with the WGAE for a three-year period. As a result of the ongoing negotiations and accompanying legal fees as well as the higher cost structure per the negotiated agreement, the effect was detrimental to the company’s financial standing as we had to endure layoffs of management in order to accommodate the editorial staff. In addition, the agreement with the union had a seemingly negative impact on our ability to obtain additional financing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We expanded our paid subscription program in October 2018 that is targeted at our users who prefer not to see advertisements on both mobile applications as well as the web browser. We offer a monthly or yearly subscription plan in exchange for an ad-free experience using a Salon app for the phone or through the browser on both the phone and desktop. In March of 2019, we began our program of gated premium content, initially in the Sex and Love category.

● | Mobile users accounted for 74% of all users in March 2019, which is up slightly from 66% in March 2018. We continue to have a company-wide focus on our users’ mobile needs, especially quick and easy access to fast-loading content optimized for better readability on smaller screens. We also have increased focus on monetization of mobile traffic through implementation of native and other mobile-optimized advertising.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We continually work toward leaner, more efficient technological systems through automation, improved architecture and adoption of emerging best practices. During the fiscal year 2019, we rebuilt our backend and content management systems in order to keep pace with the industry and reduce site latency.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | During 2019, we recognized the desirability to either merger with another company or pursue other strategic options. In this regard, we engaged the services of an investment bank and opened discussions with other interested parties. Changes in the overall digital publishing industry required us to make investments in technology that were beyond our financial capability. In the absence of making those investments, and following the substantial adjustments we had already implemented, it was clear we could not continue in our present form.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consistent with this view we entered into technology and advertising relationships with Proper Media and PubLife. The impact of these changes confirmed our belief that improving our advertising technology platform would improve our revenues and user experience. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Following a three month trial period of working closely with Proper Media and PubLife, and after considering other strategic options, we decided to sell all of the operating assets of the company to Salon, LLC, a company related to Proper Media and PubLife.

Salon Strategy 
 
Our strategy has focused on improving monetization of our user base by innovating our ad technology in order to better match our highly educated and affluent users with advertisers.  In the past few years, we have successfully attracted a sizeable user base, which in fiscal year 2019 averaged 6.2 million users per month who consumed an average of 15.2 million page views per month.  Our number of page views translates to our number of viewer impressions that can be sold to our advertisers and offers opportunities to develop business relationships with companies that want access to our attractive user base. We currently sell our impressions to advertisers programmatically based on Run of Site private marketplaces, or at times, based on editorial content that falls in a particular category such as “Movies” or “Innovation.” The CPM is driven by market demand for each category of content we offer and the demographics of our audience.  During the 2019 fiscal year we have continued to shift our focus to growing higher value traffic that maximizes our ability to monetize our page views with higher CPM video and display advertising. As a result, we have continued to adjust our editorial mix and products in order to publish more content to attract a wider universe of advertising clients and products. Going forward, the CPM that we can charge our advertisers will increasingly be based on our ability to deliver highly targeted and defined users to our advertiser.   In addition, in March 2019, we signed the Asset Purchase Agreement to consummate the Asset Sale.  If we consummate the Asset Sale, we will cease to be an operating company.  The strategies discussed in this section only apply prior to consummation of the Asset Sale (and upon any failure to close the Asset Sale).
 
Our strategy is predicated on the following core principles: (1) create high quality diversified content that meets our users’ and advertisers’ interests; (2) hire the best possible talent to create centers of excellence and (3) innovate to bring great products to our users and advertisers. Our focus on these core principles underpins our goal to continue to grow our user base, and to develop new strategies around Website monetization that will provide opportunity for future growth.
 
In fiscal year 2020, our goal is to continue our mission of creating fearless journalism and making the conversation smarter, while anticipating continued shifts in the online advertising market to better monetize our Website until consummation of the Asset Sale discussed above.  Following the Asset Sale, we intend to cease to do business and intend to not engage in any business activities except for dealing with post-closing matters (in the event the Asset Sale is consummated) and for the purpose of liquidating our remaining assets, paying any debts and obligations, distributing the remaining assets to stockholders, and doing other acts required to liquidate and wind up our business and affairs.  We will pay or make provision for payment of our known or reasonably ascertainable liabilities that have been incurred or are expected to be incurred prior to liquidation.  After that, we will distribute the remaining assets to our stockholders in proportion to their respective stockholder interest in the Company.  To reach our goals, and to achieve profitability in advance of the Asset Sale, we will push ahead in the following areas:
 

● | Develop a broader mix of provocative content in addition to the core areas of news and politics, building off the original definition of a “salon” as a center of intellectual discussion
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop new strategies to attract new readers, and decrease reliance on specific social media websites or search engines
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Integrate into our advertising approach a deeper focus on new advertising products that match our high-quality user with appropriate advertisers using data and innovative ad products
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to drive new revenue streams, including subscription, TV programming, e-commerce and book publishing to supplement advertising revenues, while keeping a keen eye on costs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Develop a Broader Mix of Provocative Content
 
We target an educated, culturally engaged audience interested in original thinking and smart commentary. We pursue that audience by featuring a diverse array of voices and perspectives, and by covering a wide range of topics including News & Politics, Life Stories, the Economy & Innovation, Culture, Health & Science, and Food. Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days per year, Salon invites users to immerse themselves in thought-provoking content that impassions and empowers them to be the intellectual and cultural leaders of our time.
 
While we continue to focus on breaking news coverage with a focus on politics, culture and world events, our new categories have been building up to a critical mass of content over the past year. These new categories include Food, Health & Science, and Economy & Innovation, and aim to give our users a wider variety of topics to choose from. The focus on these categories gave our advertisers more category-focused inventory, which has shown a year over year increase in our revenue per thousand pageviews (“RPM”) of 36.6% in March 2019 from March 2018.
 
As we continue to focus our editorial to our users’ needs, our primary goal is to grow visitors to our Website since the resulting page views serve as a platform for advertising impressions, a key driver of our revenue generation. Using data analytics in real-time, we can assess where our users’ interests are shifting, and respond by determining content, site layout and structure to best suit their needs in the moment. In fiscal year 2020, we intend to respond to users’ interests by expanding our news coverage in Washington DC for the upcoming Presidential election and key Senate races. We will expand into Washington by reallocating internal resources, making some key hires as well as continuing to have content partnerships to diversify our content offerings across various verticals. We are continually evaluating the needs of our users and trying to adjust and create new solutions to meet their needs.
 
Attract New Readers 
 
We continually need fresh content and new ideas to attract readers to our Website. We plan to continue to focus on developing our audience through a combination of editorial enhancements, increased dynamic content and new user-focused functionalities and products. 
 
One area of growth will be to attract more female users. As of March 2019, women accounted for 37.2% of our readership, down from 37.9% in March of 2018. We believe that our overall tone of the site, our community and social audience has begun to change to embrace more female readers and that will be a continued area of focus in the next year.
 
The importance in Website traffic from social media and third party distribution platforms was underpinned by the significant number of Facebook “likes” at more than 995,000, and Twitter followers at 1,005,000 as of March 2018. However, social media traffic can be variable due to changes in each platform’s approach to news content, a high number of fake accounts on these platforms, and the large number of “likes” and “followers” lost some of its prior ability to drive traffic to our website. Therefore, we have focused on building audience segments on other distribution platforms in order to diversify away from Facebook. In fiscal year 2020, we plan to continue our efforts to build our audience on social media, and place more emphasis on other emerging platforms such as Quora, Flipboard and Reddit, through a continuation of the strategies we have employed in the past two years.

Develop New Revenue Streams
 
In March 2018, we launched a subscription product that allows users to pay for ad-free content. We offer a monthly or yearly subscription plan in exchange for an ad-free experience using a Salon app for the phone. In October 2018, we added onto our subscription product a browser-based offering for those users who did not want to download an app and can see the full Salon offering off of their web browsers. In March 2019, we added on premium content in the Love and Sex category that is only offered through the paid service. 
 
Also, as a result of solid conversion ratios in e-commerce, we have also made our Salon e-commerce partnership more prominent on our Website by placing it on our top navigation bar in order to drive additional revenues. We have expanded our product categories to CBD products and productivity software and plan to add more product categories that are in line with some of our editorial strategies such as food and health.
 
In addition to these existing initiatives, we are exploring possible business opportunities in other areas such as podcasting, book publishing and a possible Salon TV show.
 
A Deeper Focus on New Advertising Products that Match our User with Appropriate Advertisers 
 
In order to expand our base of advertisers and increase our advertising revenues, we plan to integrate into our advertising approach a deeper focus on new advertising products that match our high-quality user with appropriate advertisers using data and innovative ad products. This includes entering possible partnerships with advertising technology companies that can offer highly tailored products that leverage new advertising technology and add software and data capabilities to understand our users better. This will allow us to match our readers’ interests with advertisers more closely.
Path to Profitability
 
Our operating losses in fiscal year 2019 decreased compared to fiscal year 2018, a result of our continued attempts to make adjustments to our revenue model in order to increase advertising revenues, and keep costs low in order to get closer to profitability. Due to an industry shift in advertising dollars toward programmatic and video advertising, and a decline in traffic during the year, our direct advertising increased 76% and programmatic advertising decreased 43% leading to total decrease in advertising revenues of 30% in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018. At the same time, our production costs decreased 24% from a year ago, which resulted in smaller losses.
 
Entering fiscal year 2020, we plan to build on the progress we made in increasing CPMs and advertising rates at programmatic marketplaces, and take advantage of marketing opportunities and an active news cycle to increase our page views and video views. Furthermore, in October 2018, we took steps to reduce further our expense base and shift resources to create content that will generate higher CPM advertising. Given these changes, we anticipate that fiscal year 2020 will better align production costs with our revenue potential in an effort to reach profitability.
 
OUR BUSINESS
 
We target an educated, culturally engaged audience interested in original thinking and reporting on the day’s big stories.  We pursue that audience by featuring a diverse array of voices and perspectives, and covering a wide range of topics including politics, race, religion, culture, entertainment, sustainability, innovation, technology and business.  In addition, in March 2019, we executed the Asset Purchase Agreement relating to the Asset Sale.  If the Asset Sale is consummated, we will cease to be an operating company.

Revenue Sources, From Discontinue Operations
 
Most of Salon’s revenues are derived from advertising from the sale of promotional space on its Website. Internet advertising revenues accounted for 79% of revenues in fiscal year 2019. Revenue from referring users to third party websites primarily accounted for the remaining 15% of revenues in fiscal year 2019.
 
Internet advertising is affected by broad economic conditions, like other forms of advertising, but overall it has continued its upward trend even through economic turbulence. According to the 2018 IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report conducted by PwC Advisory Services LLC, the compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) over the past ten years for Internet advertising in the United States was 16.8%, which over the past few years has been largely driven by the growth of mobile. The rapid growth of the mobile advertising platform has resulted in a CAGR of 53.8% over the past five years. Internet advertising revenue in the United States totaled $107.5 billion in 2018, a 21.8% increase from $88.3 billion in 2017. In 2018, the sources for advertising revenues were search (45%), banner (including banners, sponsorships, and rich media) (31%), video (15%) and other (9%).
 
The bulk of online advertising remains concentrated in a relatively small number of dominant Internet companies, with the top ten companies accounting for 75% of online advertising in the December 2018 quarter, and another 7% captured by the next tier of companies ranked 11th through 25th. Therefore, we believe our market opportunity falls roughly at 18% of the online advertising market, or $19.3 billion.
 
The primary factors in our ability to increase our advertising revenues in future periods are growth in our audience and the addition of higher CPM ad products, such as pre-roll video. Attracting more unique visitors to our Website is important because these users generate additional page views, and each page view becomes a potential platform for advertisements. Advertising comprises banners, video, rich media and other interactive ads across our desktop, tablet, mobile browser and apps platforms. Advertisers pay for advertising based on a CPM, and different platforms attract different CPMs. CPMs for mobile have been less than for desktop. Videos and sponsored content on mobile devices continue to grow in popularity and can demand a higher CPM. We believe that continuing to add videos and sponsored content to our mobile platform and improving and optimizing the platform’s design will help increase revenues from our mobile platform.
 
Overall, monthly unique visitors to our Website have grown from 6.3 million in March 31, 2011 to a peak of 19.6 million in June 30, 2015, and has reverted to 6.6 million in March 31, 2019. Our full year average monthly unique visitors were 6.4 million, 10.6 million, 11.2 million, 16.9 million, 16.6 million, 12.7 million, 10.6 million and 6.2 million in fiscal years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. These fluctuations reflect changes in content areas on our Website over this period, and adjustments to search engine optimization and social media algorithms.

Sales and Marketing
 
As a news and lifestyle Website that competes against much larger websites, we have sought to distinguish ourselves in the marketplace by offering customized, innovative and integrated advertising products that appeal to users and seamlessly and organically incorporate our advertising clients and their objectives into our Website. We work with our programmatic advertising partners to launch advertisements that match our high-quality audience, and innovate with new products as they become available. In addition, we also offer sponsorships of content that come through direct sales.
 
Our sales and marketing operation are located in New York, with one advertising sales and operations employee who actively solicits orders as of March 31, 2019.
 
Infrastructure and Product Development 
 
We recognize that users come to the site for online news, reporting, opinion and an engaging, active community of writers, users and commenters. Users engage with the site through desktop computers, mobile phones and social networking platforms and other referral partners. To meet users’ rapidly evolving online media needs, we are continually innovating and developing our Website, mobile Website and social media presence – by adding new features, design updates and technologies that improve the user experience, speed and search engine optimization. We have developed an internal culture of innovation where the Edit, Technology and Sales teams collaborate on product development.
 
Our Website is hosted on cloud-based virtual servers running open-source Linux operating systems and various open-source web and network software packages. Our top technical priority is the fast and reliable delivery of pages to our users. Our systems are designed to handle traffic growth and network failures by balancing the requests among several pools of servers across the globe that automatically scale to match traffic demands. We rely on multiple tiers of redundancy/failover and third-party Content Delivery Network to achieve our goal of 24 hours, seven-days-a-week Website uptime. Regular automated backups protect the integrity of our data. Our servers are continuously monitored by numerous third-party and open-source monitoring and alerting tools.

In fiscal year 2017, we launched a Website redesign that put in place a publishing infrastructure that better takes advantage of current technologies. The redesign allows a better user experience as a result of quicker load time, and improved re-circulation of Salon content on each page, and improved monetization due to improved viewability of ads on our website. As a part of this redesign, we continued building new products for video and mobile, expanded our social media integration, and improved security and scaling capabilities.
 
In fiscal year 2018, we completed our Website and advertising architecture redesign from the previous year aimed at improving the user experience. As part of this effort, we will continue to explore new products that meet the immediate needs of our mobile users, build out new advertising products for video and mobile and improve our security and scaling capabilities.
 
In fiscal year 2019, we completed our backend systems and content management system upgrade to allow for faster speeds that allow us to be more competitive for programmatic advertising fill rates and prices as latency time decreased by 75%.
 
Competition
 
The bulk of online advertising remains concentrated in a relatively small number of dominant Internet companies, with the top ten companies accounting for 75% of U.S. online advertising in 2018 and another 8% captured by the next tier of companies ranked 11th through 25th. Therefore, we believe our market opportunity falls roughly at 18% of the online advertising market, or $19.3 billion. We compete for advertising revenues with numerous websites, including major portals such as Yahoo/AOL, major search engines such as Google, major social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, and other online large media publications such as Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, New York Times, Washington Post, MSNBC and CNN.com. We also compete with many smaller news and politics-oriented websites, such as Slate, The Daily Beast, The Atlantic, Talking Points Memo, Politico and Axios for staff, audience and advertising sales.
Proprietary Rights
 
Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on the goodwill associated with our trademarks, trade names, service marks and other proprietary rights and on our ability to use U.S. laws to protect our intellectual property, including our original content, content provided by third parties, and content provided by columnists. We have a registered trademark on our Salon name and logo.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, Salon has 24 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. We believe our relations with our employees are good. We commenced collective bargaining with our non-supervisory editorial employees in November 2015, and signed a three-year agreement with the Writers Guild of America East (WGAE) in October 2018. Our future success is highly dependent on our ability to attract, hire, retain and motivate talented personnel.
