Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Energizer Holdings, Inc. (Energizer), through its operating subsidiaries, is one of the world’s largest manufacturers, marketers and distributors of household batteries, specialty batteries and lighting products, and a leading designer and marketer of automotive fragrance and appearance products. 
Energizer is the beneficiary of over 100 years of expertise in the battery and portable lighting products industries. Its brand names, Energizer® and Eveready®, have worldwide recognition for innovation, quality and dependability, and are marketed and sold around the world. 
On July 1, 2015, Energizer completed its legal separation from our former parent company, Edgewell Personal Care Company (Edgewell), via a tax free spin-off (the Spin-off or Spin).
On January 15, 2018, Energizer entered into a definitive acquisition agreement with Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (Spectrum) to acquire its global battery, lighting and portable power business (Spectrum battery acquisition) for a purchase price of $2.0 billion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. The transaction was subject to various conditions, including regulatory approval. The Company has received required regulatory approval, with the exception of the European Commission (EC). On November 15, 2018, we entered into an amended definitive acquisition agreement with Spectrum and proposed a remedy for consideration to the EC. The remedy set forth by Energizer includes the divestiture of the Europe-based Varta® consumer battery business, including manufacturing and distribution facilities in Germany. Based on the original purchase price, net of anticipated divestiture proceeds, the Company now expects our net purchase price to be in the range of $1.4 to $1.5 billion. Contingent upon the EC’s approval of the proposed remedy, Energizer expects to close the Spectrum battery acquisition at the beginning of calendar year 2019.
On November 15, 2018, Energizer entered into a definitive acquisition agreement to acquire Spectrum’s global auto care business, including Armor All®, STP®, and A/C PRO® brands, for a purchase price of $1.25 billion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments (Spectrum auto care acquisition). The purchase price is comprised of an estimated $938 million in cash and $312 million of newly-issued equity to Spectrum. The Spectrum auto care acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second fiscal quarter of 2019.
Energizer operates as an independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol "ENR."

 Our Reporting Segments
Operations for Energizer are managed via two major geographic reportable segments: 
•Americas, which is comprised of North and Latin America; and
•International, which is comprised of Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific.

Prior to January 1, 2018, the International segment was reported as two separate geographic reportable segments:

Our Products
Today, Energizer offers batteries using many technologies including lithium, alkaline, carbon zinc, nickel metal hydride, zinc air, and silver oxide. These products are sold under the Energizer and Eveready brands in the performance, premium and price segments and include primary, rechargeable, specialty and hearing aid products. In addition, Energizer has an extensive line of lighting products designed to meet a variety of consumer needs. We manufacture, distribute, and market lighting products including headlights, lanterns, children’s lights and area lights. In addition to the Energizer and Eveready brands, we market our flashlights under the Hard Case®, Dolphin®, and WeatherReady® sub-brands. In addition to batteries and portable lights, Energizer licenses the Energizer and Eveready brands to companies developing consumer solutions in gaming, automotive batteries, portable power for critical devices (like smart phones), LED light bulbs and other lighting products.
Energizer has a long history of innovation within our categories. Since our commercialization of the first dry-cell battery in 1893 and the first flashlight in 1899, we have been committed to developing and marketing new products to meet evolving consumer needs and consistently advancing battery technology as the universe of devices has evolved. Over the past 100+ years we have developed or brought to market:
•the first flashlight;
•the first dry cell alkaline battery;
•the first mercury-free alkaline battery; and
•Energizer Ultimate Lithium®, the world’s longest-lasting AA and AAA battery for high-tech devices.
Our product development approach is grounded in meeting the needs of consumers. In household batteries, we offer a broad portfolio of batteries that deliver long-lasting performance, reliability and quality, which we believe provide consumers the best overall experience. In addition to primary battery technology we offer consumers primary rechargeable options, as well as hearing aid and specialty batteries. This broad portfolio allows us to penetrate a wide range of markets and consumer segments.
Our innovative line of portable lighting products is designed to meet a breadth of consumer needs, from outdoor activities to emergency situations. With our experience and insight, we are bringing portable lighting solutions to market that are designed to enhance the lives of consumers worldwide.
In addition, Energizer's portfolio of innovative products also includes automotive fragrance and appearance products marketed under the Nu Finish®, Refresh Your Car!®, California Scents®, Driven®, Bahama & Co.®, LEXOL®, and Eagle One® brands.

Our Industry
              We are a branded manufacturing and distribution company that markets and sells in the battery, lights and auto care categories.  These categories are highly competitive, both in the U.S. and on a global basis. We invest in our brands and innovation to meet the needs of consumers, and with our large global footprint, we both manufacture and source our products. Competition within our categories is based upon brand perceptions, product performance, price, retail execution and customer service. Key drivers of the battery business are device technology, consumer demographics and disasters. Competition in this category remains aggressive in the U.S. and other markets and could continue to put additional pressure on our results going forward, particularly as consumers shift consumption between channels such as e-commerce and discounters.
In household batteries, Energizer offers batteries based on carbon zinc, alkaline, lithium, nickel metal hydride, zinc air, and silver oxide technologies. These products are sold under the Energizer and Eveready brands in the performance, premium and price segments and include primary, rechargeable, specialty and hearing aid products. In the higher-price premium and performance segments, characterized by the alkaline and lithium technologies, our primary competitor is Duracell International, Inc. (Duracell). Duracell, which primarily produces batteries using alkaline technology, is a significant global competitor. In the price-conscious market segment, characterized by price alkaline and carbon zinc technologies, we compete with a number of local country and regional manufacturers of private-label, or “non-branded,” batteries, as well as branded battery manufacturers such as Spectrum Brands, Inc. and Panasonic Corporation, primarily in Latin America, Asia and EMEA.  Alkaline and lithium batteries are generally both more technologically advanced and expensive, with a longer battery life, than carbon zinc batteries. Our sales in North America, Europe and more developed economies throughout the world are concentrated in alkaline batteries.  We believe that private-label, or “non-branded,” sales by large retailers also have an impact on the market in some parts of the world, particularly in certain European markets such as Germany and Spain.
The portable lights category volume is flat to slightly down due to LED technology.  Our competition is highly fragmented with diverse competitors by markets, including private-label.  Our portfolio includes portable lights under the Energizer and Eveready brands globally as well as the Dolphin brand in Australia and New Zealand.  Across all brands we have a portfolio that includes hand-held, hands-free and area lighting.  
Within the auto care category, Energizer has a broad portfolio of brands, including Refresh Your Car!, Driven, California Scents, and Bahama & Co. within the auto fragrance sub-category, and Nu Finish, Scratch Doctor, LEXOL and Eagle One within the auto appearance sub-category. 
We sell to our customers, which include brick and mortar retailers as well as e-commerce retailers, through a combination of a direct sales force and exclusive and non-exclusive third party distributors and wholesalers, based on our go-to-market strategy for a particular market.    
Sales and Distribution
We distribute our products to consumers through numerous retail locations worldwide, including mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, food, drug and convenience stores, electronics specialty stores and department stores, hardware and automotive centers, e-commerce and military stores. Although a large percentage of our sales are attributable to a relatively small number of retail customers, in fiscal year 2018, only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for ten percent or more (11.5%) of the Company's annual sales. 
Our products are marketed primarily through a direct sales force, but also through exclusive and non-exclusive distributors and wholesalers. Our products are sold through both “modern” and “traditional” trade. “Modern” trade, which is most prevalent in North America, Western Europe, and more developed economies throughout the world, generally refers to sales through large retailers with nationally or regionally recognized brands. “Traditional” trade, which is more common in developing markets in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, generally refers to sales by wholesalers or small retailers who may not have a national or regional presence.
Because of the short period between order and shipment date (generally less than one month) for most of our orders, the dollar amount of current backlog is not material and is not considered to be a reliable indicator of future sales

volume. Generally, sales to our top customers are made pursuant to purchase orders and we do not have guarantees of minimum purchases from them. As a result, these customers may cancel their purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us at any time.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used by Energizer include electrolytic manganese dioxide, zinc, silver, nickel, lithium, graphite, steel, plastic, brass wire, and potassium hydroxide. The prices and availability of these raw materials have fluctuated over time. We believe that adequate supplies of the raw materials required for our operations are available at the present time, although we cannot predict the future availability or prices of such materials. These raw materials are generally available from a number of different sources, and the prices of those raw materials are susceptible to currency fluctuations and price fluctuations due to supply and demand, transportation, government regulations, price controls, economic climate, or other unforeseen circumstances. In the past, we have not experienced any significant interruption in availability of raw materials. We believe we have extensive experience in purchasing raw materials in the commodity markets. From time to time, our management has purchased materials or entered into forward commitments for various ingredients to assure supply and to protect margins on anticipated sales volume.
Our Trademarks, Patents and Technology
Our ability to compete effectively in the battery and portable lighting categories depends, in part, on our ability to protect our brands and maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and manufacturing processes through a combination of trademark, patent and trade secret protection. We own thousands of Energizer and Eveready trademarks globally, which we consider to be of substantial importance and which are used individually or in conjunction with other sub-brand names. As of September 30, 2018, the Energizer trademark was registered in 169 countries, and the Eveready trademark was registered in 143 countries, including in each case, in the United States. Additionally, the Energizer Bunny design trademark was registered in 48 countries, including in the United States, and the Mr. Energizer design trademark was registered in 69 countries and the European Union. The number of Energizer, Eveready, Energizer bunny design, and Mr. Energizer design trademarks, including related designs, slogans and sub-brands, is currently over 2,700 worldwide. In our auto care business, as of September 30, 2018, we also have the Refresh Your Car! trademark registered in 26 countries, the California Scents trademark registered in 28 countries, the Driven trademark registered in 25 countries, the Bahama & Co. trademark registered in 24 countries, the LEXOL trademark registered in 8 countries, the Eagle One trademark registered in 101 countries and the Nu Finish trademark registered in 19 countries. Each of the referenced trademarks is registered in the United States. The number of trademarks making up the total of the auto care trademark portfolio globally, including related designs, slogans, and sub-brands, is currently over 400 worldwide.
We also own a number of patents, patent applications and other technology that relate primarily to battery, lighting and automotive fragrance and appearance products, which we believe are significant to our business. As of September 30, 2018, we owned approximately 541 United States utility and design patents, which have a range of expiration dates from October 2018 to July 2037, and approximately 52 United States pending patent applications. We expect to routinely prepare additional patent applications for filing in the United States and abroad. As of September 30, 2018, we owned (directly or beneficially) approximately 606 foreign patents and approximately 41 patent applications pending in foreign countries.
Seasonality
Sales and operating profit for our business tend to be seasonal, with increased purchases by consumers and increases in retailer inventories occurring for batteries during our fiscal first quarter and for automotive fragrance and appearance products during our fiscal second and third quarters. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes can create conditions that drive short-term increases in the need for portable power and lighting products and thereby increase our battery and flashlight sales. As a result of this seasonality, our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate throughout the year. 
Employees
As of September 30, 2018, we have approximately 4,000 employees, including approximately 1,300 employees based in the U.S. Roughly 30 employees are unionized, primarily at our Marietta, Ohio facility. Overall, we consider our employee relations to be good.
 Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment.

Contamination at current and former facilities as well as third-party waste disposal sites continues to be monitored. In connection with some sites, we are in dialogue with federal or state agencies and/or private parties seeking contributions as a “potentially responsible party” under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.  The amount of our ultimate liability in connection with such facilities and sites will depend on many factors, including the type and extent of contamination, whether remediation should occur, the remediation methods and technology to be used, the extent to which other parties may share liability and, in the case of waste disposal sites, the volume and toxicity of material at the site. In fiscal year 2018, we spent approximately $1 million on environmental monitoring/remedial matters. However, these costs can fluctuate from discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of further cleanup obligations.
Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses continue to increase, although due to optimization efforts, the expenditures are not expected to have a material effect on total capital and operating expenditures, consolidated earnings or competitive positioning at this time. Environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in legal requirements or the enforcement or interpretation of existing requirements. Any imposition of new or more stringent environmental requirements and increased enforcement may increase the risk and expense of doing business in such countries.
