ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview of Our Business 
 We are an integrated food manufacturing company headquartered in Shandong Province, China. We develop, manufacture and sell the following types of food products:
 
 | Chestnut products; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Convenience foods (including ready-to-cook, or RTC, foods, and ready-to-eat, or RTE, foods); and 
 | Frozen food products. 

 We conduct our production activities in China. Our products are sold in Chinese domestic markets as well as exported to foreign countries and regions such as Japan, South Korea and Europe. We derive most of our revenues from sales in China, Japan and South Korea.
 Organizational Structure
ALN is a Nevada corporation that was incorporated on February 4, 1986 and was formerly known as Millennium Quest, Inc. Effective November 12, 2009, ALN reincorporated in Nevada from Delaware.
 ALN owns 100% of ILH. ILH wholly owns two Chinese operating subsidiaries, Luotian Lorain and Junan Hongrun, directly. Junan Hongrun, in turn, owns 100% of Dongguan Lorain. In addition, together with Junan Hongrun, ILH wholly owns Beijing Lorain, Shandong Greenpia, and owns approximately 80% of Shandong Lorain (Shandong Economic Development Investment Co. Ltd. owns approximately 20%). Shenzhen Lorain is a variable interest entity (the VIE entity), which entered in to a series of agreements ( the VIE Agreements) with Shandong Greenpia in December 2017. We sometimes refer to our six Chinese operating subsidiaries, the VIE Entity and the Athena Group throughout this annual report on Form 10-K as the Lorain Group Companies. Below is an organizational chart of ALN, ILH and the Lorain Group Companies:

* Athena is a holding company which holds majority of the capital and the voting shares of Conserverie Minerve, a company organized under French law. Conserverie Minerve specializes in the processing and sale of chestnut and prepared foods products in Europe. Conserverie Minerve operates its businesses through the following, direct and indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries:
 
 | Sojafrais, a company organized under French law; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | SCI SIAM, a real estate company organized under French law; 
 | SCI GIU LONG, a real estate company organized under French law; and 
 | CACOVIN, a company organized under Portuguese law. 

 On June 6, 2015, Athena approved the merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Conserverie Minerve into Athena. Athena assumed all contracts, rights, assets and liabilities of Conserverie Minerve after the merger. Athena was a holding company with no operations and its only asset was the equity of Conserverie Minerve. On August 8, 2015, the merger was completed. In April 2016, Athena ceased operations as discussed above.
Products 
 Our products are categorized into the following three segments:
 
 | Chestnut products, 
--+-------------------------------
 | Convenience food products, and
 | Frozen food products. 

 2

We produced 143 products in 2017. We produced 56 frozen food products in 2017. We also discontinued 71 products in 2017.
 Chestnut Products
 We produced 55 high value-added processed chestnut products in 2017. In 2017 and 2016, this segment contributed 41% and 57% of our total revenues, respectively.
 Our best selling products in 2016 and 2017 included our frozen chestnuts. The majority of our chestnut products are natural and do not contain chemical additives.
 The chestnut, in contrast to many other tree nuts, contains small quantities of oil and is very high in complex carbohydrates. This makes them useful for a wider food range than other common nuts. Chestnuts are commonly steamed, boiled, sugar stir-fried, roasted or added into dishes or desserts as an ingredient.
 We position our chestnut products as middle to high end products. We differentiate our chestnut products based on production process, high quality raw materials inputs, flavor, size and method of packaging. For instance, some of our chestnut products that are sold in Japan are packaged in plastic bags or tin cans, each considered a different product. Similarly, some of our chestnut products are processed with hot water or cold water, each considered a different product.
 Chestnut season in China lasts from September to January. We purchase and produce raw chestnuts during these months and store them in our refrigerated storage facilities throughout the year. Once we obtain a purchase order during the rest of the year, we remove the chestnuts from storage, process them and ship them within one day of production.
 Convenience Foods
 Our convenience food products are characterized as follows:
 
 | Ready-to-cook, or RTC, food products, and
--+------------------------------------------
 | Ready-to-eat, or RTE, food products. 

 These products are intended to meet the current demands of our customers for safe, wholesome and tasty foods that are easily prepared.
 RTCs can be served after a few easy cooking procedures. Typically, when preparing a RTC, customers need only to heat the food in a microwave or boil it for several minutes before eating. Our best-selling RTCs in 2016 and 2017 were French fries.
 RTEs can be served without any cooking. Our best-selling RTEs in 2016 and 2017 were various bean products and various fried vegetables.
 We produced 92 convenience food products in 2016 and 42 convenience food products in 2017. In 2017 and 2016, this segment contributed 20.1% and 20.3%, respectively, of our total revenues.
 Frozen Food Products
 We produce a variety of frozen foods, mostly frozen vegetables and frozen fruits. We produced 62 frozen food products in 2016 and 56 frozen food products in 2017. Our best-selling frozen food products in 2016 and 2017 was sweet corn products.
 3

Our frozen food business allows us to mitigate the significant production seasonality of chestnut products and to increase the utilization rate of our production capacity. The frozen foods accounted for in our total revenue increased from 22.7% in 2016 to 38.9% in 2017. Gross margins in this segment are lower than the margins for chestnut products and convenience foods.
 Our Manufacturing Facilities
 General
 We currently manufacture our products in four facilities in China, two of which are located in Junan County, Shandong Province, one in Luotian County, Hubei Province, and one in Miyun County, Beijing.
 The following table indicates the year that operations commenced at each of the facilities and the size of the facilities. 

 
 | Year Operations Facility Size 
------------------+------------------------------------
Facility | Commenced | (square meters)
Junan Hongrun | 2002 | 38,865 
Beijing Lorain | 2003 | 21,000 
Luotian Lorain | 2003 | 9,558 
Shandong Greenpia | 2010 | 9,179 

 Production Lines
We currently manufacture our products using 29 production lines. Except Chinese doughnuts production lines, each production line is used to produce between 10 and 50 products. We currently run four types of product lines:

 | Deep-freezing lines, which are used to freeze raw materials for year-round production and to produce frozen food; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Canning lines, which are used to produce canned products, including chestnut products; 
 | Convenience food lines, which are used for producing RTCs and RTEs, all of which have nitrogen preservation capacity; and 
 | Chinese doughnuts lines, which are used to produce Chinese doughnut products. 

 The production process for our chestnut products initially involves sorting and cleaning the raw chestnuts purchased during the chestnut season. We then store the raw chestnuts in our refrigerated storage facilities throughout the year. Once we obtain a purchase order, we remove the chestnuts from storage and process them by steaming, decladding and deep-freezing the chestnuts, depending on the particular product. We then package and ship the processed chestnuts within one day of production.
 The production process of our convenience products generally involves various steps, including soaking, boiling, coating, drying, deep freezing, packing, sealing and sterilizing.
 The following table shows the number and types of production lines, the types of products produced and the production capacity at each facility: 

  
Facilities | Production Lines | Product Portfolio | 2017 Capacity 
------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Junan Hongrun | 3 Deep-freezing line 4 Convenience food lines 4 Canning lines 4 Chinese doughnut lines | Chestnut products, frozen foods, beans, bean paste | Multi-purpose production lines with 74,000 tons of production capacity Chinese doughnut lines with 2000 tons production capacity 24,900 tons of cold and frozen storage 
Beijing Lorain | 6 Convenience food lines 1 Deep-freezing line | Chestnut products, frozen foods | Multi-purpose production lines with 34,000 tons of production capacity 4,650 tons of cold and frozen storage 
Luotian Lorain | 3 Convenience food lines 2 Deep-freezing lines | Chestnut products, convenience foods, frozen foods | Multi-purpose production lines with 24,000 tons of production capacity 6,500 tons of cold and frozen storage 
Shandong Greenpia | 2 Convenience food lines | Chestnut products, convenience foods | Multi-purpose production lines with 9,000 tons of production capacity 1,500 tons of cold and frozen storage

We allocate our production lines based upon the location of our facilities to take advantage of efficiencies in the transportation of required raw materials. For example, Junan Hongrun and Shandong Lorain, which manufacture primarily chestnut and frozen products, are located in Shandong Province, which is Chinas largest supplier of fresh products by volume. Shandong Province is also a major chestnut producing region.
 Our production lines and facilities have all been designed to meet the standards and requirements of our largest customers in South Korea and Japan, with Japan being our top overseas markets in value term.
 We employ advanced methods of quality control and have obtained various certifications for many of our products, packages and processes, including ISO 9000 or ISO 9001 certification for certain of our chestnut and frozen vegetable products, BRC certification for certain of our frozen fruit and vegetable products and HACCP certification for certain of our frozen vegetable, fruit and chestnut products and our bottom-open chestnuts. We believe that our quality controls and standards of products distinguish us from other manufacturers in both domestic and international markets.
 With limited exception, we operate our production lines year round. In the past, when our production was focused almost exclusively on chestnuts, we experienced seasonal underutilization of our product lines. However, our current facilities have multiple-function designs allowing us to use our production lines for our convenience and frozen products when we are not producing chestnuts at full capacity. Consequently, as we have increased our processed and convenience food offerings over the last several years, we have generally been able to run our production lines at increasing efficiency.
 Storage Capacity
 Storage of our raw materials and inventory is a critical element of our business. Our raw materials and partially finished products need to be preserved in frozen storages (-18ºC to -20ºC) or constant temperature storages (-5ºC to 5ºC). Storage is particularly critical for our chestnut products because chestnuts are a seasonal fruit.
 The following table illustrates on a facility by facility basis the type and capacity of our storage resources:
 
 | | Number of | Capacity 
------------------+----------------------+---------------+--------------
Facility | Storage Type | Storage Units | (metric tons)
Junan Hongrun | Frozen Storage | 19 | 20,100 
 | Constant Temperature | 11 | 5,300 
Beijing Lorain | Frozen Storage | 6 | 2,850 
 | Constant Temperature | 3 | 1,800 
Luotian Lorain | Frozen Storage | 8 | 4,500 
 | Constant Temperature | 4 | 2,000 
Shandong Greenpia | Constant Temperature | 4 | 1,500 
TOTAL | | 60 | 41,050

All of the listed storage facilities are owned by us. We did not add to our storage capacity during 2017.
 Agricultural Operations
 We grow or set up agricultural co-ops with local farmers to supply ourselves with a small portion of chestnut, fruit and vegetable products. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the supplies coming from agricultural operations were still a low proportion of the total.
 Lands in which we grow our agricultural products for such products are shown in the following table.
 
 | Area | Location

 We began growing chestnuts in Shandong Province in 2003. Unlike most vegetables and fruits, chestnut trees have a 3-5 year growing phase before they can be harvested. Our current chestnut planting base has been self-supplying limited quantities of chestnuts to our production since 2007. In the end of 2016, we leased two woods in Junan County Shandong Province, China to plant more chestnuts trees.
 In 2017, we grew strawberries in Shandong, which is used in our frozen fruit products. 
 Raw Materials
 In 2017 and 2016, approximately 65% and 85% of our procured raw materials, respectively, consisted of agricultural products, including primarily chestnuts and vegetables, approximately 26% and 6%, respectively, consisted of packaging materials and approximately 9% and 9% consisted of condiments such as sugar, salt and flour.
Our Supply Sources
 Our business depends on obtaining a reliable supply of various agricultural products, including chestnuts, vegetables, red meat, fish, eggs, rice and flour. Because of the diversity of available sources of these raw materials, we believe that our raw materials are currently in adequate supply and will continue to be so in the future.
 6

We obtain our agricultural raw materials from three sources: domestic procurement (excluding self-supply), overseas markets, and self-supply. Domestic and overseas procurement accounted for 93.2% and 4.8%, respectively, of our total raw material costs in 2017, while self-supply accounted for 2%. Domestic and overseas procurement accounted for 91% and 6.8%, respectively, of our total raw material costs in 2016, while self-supply accounted for 2.2% . We obtained substantially all of our agricultural raw materials from domestic sources during 2016 and 2017.
 In 2017 and 2016, respectively, we procured approximately 1,670 and 31,892 metric tons of chestnuts and approximately 457 and 32,487 metric tons of vegetables and other raw materials from a number of third party suppliers, domestic and overseas, and produced approximately 959 and 438 metric tons of chestnuts and other products from our own agricultural operations.
 We select suppliers based on price and product quality. We typically rely on numerous domestic and international suppliers, including some with whom we have a long-term relationship. Our top 10 suppliers accounted for 12.1% and 13.6% of the total procurement in 2017 and 2016 in value terms respectively. We purchase from suppliers and farmers pursuant to supply contracts and underlying purchase orders. We have not entered into any long-term contracts with any of our suppliers.
 Our suppliers generally include wholesale agricultural product companies, agricultural associations and distributors. Some raw materials must be imported at higher costs, however. Occasionally, we also work directly with farmers. For instance, we operate an initiative which involves a series of cooperation and lease agreements between Shandong Lorain, Beijing Lorain and local farmers. This initiative involves approximately 1,000 acres of land which is used primarily to produce Japanese and Korean style chestnuts, sticky corn and pumpkins for our operations.
 Procurement Cost and Quality Control
 To control procurement costs, we have built our facilities near domestic sources of agricultural raw materials. For example, Junan Hongrun and Shandong Lorain are located in Shandong Province, which is Chinas largest supplier of fresh products by volume. Shandong Province is also a major chestnut producing region. Local procurement reduces our costs, especially transportation costs. It also gives us first-hand harvest and market information, which provides us with an advantage in price negotiations with suppliers.
 Pricing for agricultural products reflects several external factors, such as weather conditions and commodity market fluctuations, which are beyond our control. We obtain contemporaneous information on local harvests and collect daily reported price information on harvests in other markets from which we procure our products. We also attempt to predict harvest yields in advance based on our information gathering. We use this harvest information to negotiate best pricing with our suppliers.
 We impose strict standards on our suppliers. During the harvest season, our internal procurement function personnel may visit our sources of supply to assure that the products we are purchasing comply with our standards.
 Our Customers
 Our products are sold in Chinese domestic markets as well as exported to foreign countries and regions such as Japan and South Korea. In 2017 and 2016, approximately 84.1% and 82.1%, respectively of our sales were made domestically in China and approximately 15.9% and 17.9% were to international customers, primarily Japan and South Korea. Our top ten customers contributed 12% and 12.1% of our total revenues in 2017 and 2016 respectively.
Domestic
 In China, we sell our products through our own sales team and through third-party distributors. We have 18 sales offices in 12 provinces in China. In 2017 and 2016, we sold approximately 75.6% and 72.6%, respectively, of our products directly to our Chinese and overseas customers and approximately 24.4% and 27.4% through third-party distributors. In view of a significant decline in our sales volume in 2017, we decided to cut spending. The performance of our third-party distributors was significantly lower than expected, and our direct-selling business is the main source of revenue. In addition, due to the low demand of the market, the third-party distributors needed fewer products, which result that our relationship not as close as the previous years, leading to the increase of bad debts. Therefore, we decided to reduce the proportion of third-party distributors and enhance our own sales team.
 7

We sell our products in first-tier cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou. Our sales team sells our products directly to supermarket chains, mass merchandisers, large wholesalers and others in these markets. In second-tier and third-tier cities, we currently sell our products to third-party distributors, such as food companies or trading companies with established distribution channels in such regions, rather than through our own sales team, in order to enable us to penetrate such markets more quickly without spending significant capital. We also sell to small customers through independent sales representatives.
 The terms of a typical sales contract between us and our distributors provide that we are responsible for transportation costs and the distributors are responsible for storage costs. Furthermore, the distributors have the right to return products that fail to satisfy specified quality standards, at our cost. The majority of such contracts require the distributors to pay us in cash in full upon delivery, and the remaining contracts provide for short-term credit, usually two to three weeks. In addition, we typically offer distributors performance-based incentives, such as a cash bonus equal to 1% to 1.5% of total revenues generated by such distributor which exceed previously established sales targets.
 International
 Our export sales destinations include Asia Pacific, primarily Japan and South Korea. Outside China, sales in Europe decreased by 100% in 2017 as a result of a bad sales performance in France and Portugal and the shutdown of Athena Group. Sales in Asia countries also decreased by 93.6% due to weak demand in Asia countries.
 We sell our products to international markets primarily through export and trading agents and companies in China, as well as our own sales team located in China and Japan. Our sales team sells directly to wholesalers, food processors and mass merchandisers.
 Our Sales and Marketing Efforts
 We have not spent a significant amount of capital on advertising in the past, and our advertising budget continues to be limited. In 2017 our marketing and branding efforts included supermarket advertising and internet advertising.
Competition and Market Position
 The overall food market is diverse, both globally and in China. We do not have a significant market share in any of our business segments.
 Chestnut Products
 We compete in the chestnut market primarily on the basis of the uniqueness of our products, quality, price and brand recognition. We also utilize our proprietary, patented and patent-pending technology in the production of our chestnut products to our competitive advantage.
 The world market for chestnut products is highly fragmented. Our principal competitors in the chestnut product market are currently Hebei Liyuan, a Chinese company, and Foodwell Corporation, a South Korean company.

Convenience Food Products
 The market competition for convenience food products is based mostly upon quality and product variety. We attempt to use our modern food processing technology, such as nitrogen preservation, to produce a wide variety of high quality convenience foods.
 The convenience food market in China is highly fragmented and we do not face competitive pressure from any particular competitor or small group of competitors.
 Frozen Food Products
 In the frozen food product market, competition is based primarily upon quality, ability to provide a reliable product supply and customer relationships.
 Our strongest competitors in the frozen food products market are currently Beijing Liliangzi Food Co. Ltd., Hangzhou Dadi Food Co. Ltd. and Tianjin Jinkaili Food Co. Ltd., all of which are located in China.
Intellectual Property
 Trademarks
 We have registered in the PRC the trademark 
 which we use on all of our products sold in China.
 Patents
 We were granted two patents by the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC during 2012, including the preparation of aerated snack beans and frozen bottom open chestnuts. One patent for preparation of liquor preserved fish and soup was approved in 2013. In 2014, our patent application during 2012 for the preservation, storage and processing procedures for chestnuts was approved. We made application for three patents to State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC during 2015.
 In addition to the above-mentioned patents, we also possess 16 patents for utility models and 15 patents for appearance design.
 We take reasonable steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, such as limiting disclosure of proprietary plans, methods and other similar information on a need-to-know basis and requiring employees with access to our proprietary technology to enter into confidentiality arrangements. We believe that our proprietary technology and trade secrets are adequately protected.
 Our Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 1,067 employees. Approximately 717 of our full-time employees are directly employed by our subsidiary companies and the remaining employees are employed by outsourcing agents that we use to meet our staffing needs. Compared to 2016, the total employees decreased by 25.1% due to our significant production capacity declining and bad operating performance.
 All of the departments were hit as a result of huge losses in 2017, especially the production department and domestic sales department. Since our revenue from main business decreased significantly, 358 full-time employees were dismissed. We shut down 8 sales offices in 2017 to reduce the personnel and administrative expenses. As required by Chinese law, all employees are party to a written employment contract. We compensate the employees outsourced from agents directly and pay agents a service fee. Agents are responsible for the pension and social insurance benefits of the leased employees, as described below.
 The following table sets forth the allocation of employees, both direct and leased, by job function.

Department | Employees
Production | 810 
Quality Control | 38 
Domestic Sales | 100

Research and Development | 21 
International Sales | 15 
Finance | 20 
Procurement | 18 
Administration | 20 
Strategic Planning | 5 
Total | 1,067 

 We have not experienced any significant problems or disruption to our operations due to labor disputes, nor have we experienced any difficulties in recruitment and retention of experienced staff.
 We compensate our production line employees by unit produced (piece work) and compensate other employees with a base salary and bonus based on performance. We also provide training for our staffs from time to time to enhance their technical and product knowledge, including knowledge of industry quality standards.
 Our employees participate in state pension scheme and various types of social insurance organized by municipal and provincial governments. Outsourcing agents are responsible for contributions on behalf of the leased employees.
 Our Research and Development Activities
 We have research and development staffs at each of our facilities. In total, 21 employees are dedicated to research and development.
 We rely heavily on customer feedback to assist us in the modification and development of our products. We also utilize customer feedback to assist us in the development of new products.
 The amount we spent on research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was not a material portion of our total expenses for those years.
 Government Regulation
 As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to regulations of Chinas Agricultural Ministry and Ministry of Health. This regulatory scheme governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food. It also regulates manufacturing practices, including quality assurance programs, for foods through its current manufacturing practice regulations, and specifies the standards of identity for certain foods.
 We have obtained approvals from Chinese authorities for products that requires the approval under regulations, including chestnuts, frozen vegetables and fruits, fish, and canned products. Production of new products that do not fall into categories of products would require separate approval from the appropriate Chinese authorities. We have consistently obtained such approvals for our newly developed products in the past and do not anticipate any difficulties in obtaining new approvals in the future if needed.
 In addition, we are required to obtain governmental approval, and to register with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, in order to open a new facility in China. We have consistently obtained such approvals, and made such registrations, for our new facilities in the past and do not anticipate any difficulties in filing new registrations and obtaining new approvals in the future if needed.
 10

Under the relevant PRC sanitation laws governing food export, unless an exporters products are exempted from inspection, products must be inspected in accordance with the Law of the PRC on Import and Export Commodity Inspection. We have not been exempted from inspection. In the past, we were authorized by the relevant authorities to conduct self-inspection of certain of our export products. However, currently, the relevant authorities have imposed tighter food safety control in China, and as a result, all of our exported food products must be inspected by relevant government agencies. We believe that all of our exported products are currently in compliance with such requirements and we do not anticipate any difficulties in complying with such rules in the future.
 In addition, we are required to obtain a license from the local branch of the Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau of China for our exported products. We have consistently obtained such licenses in the past and we do not anticipate any difficulties in obtaining such licenses in the future.
