ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Founded in 1967, we are a leading global provider of next-generation 911 emergency systems ("NG-911") and secure wireless and satellite communications technologies. We see these two end-markets as part of what Comtech has identified as the “Failsafe Communications Market.” This includes the critical communications infrastructure that people, businesses, and governments rely on when durable, trusted connectivity is required, no matter where they are – on land, at sea, or in the air – and no matter what the circumstances – from armed conflict to a natural disaster. Our solutions are designed to fulfill our customers’ needs for secure wireless communications in the most demanding environments, including those where traditional communications are unavailable or cost-prohibitive, and in mission-critical and other scenarios where performance is crucial. We anticipate future growth in our business due to increasing demand for global voice, video and data usage. We provide our solutions to both commercial and governmental customers. 
Business Segments 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we revised our business segments to better align them with end-markets for our products and services. Our businesses have been re-organized into two new reportable segments: “Satellite and Space Communications” and “Terrestrial and Wireless Networks.” All current and prior periods reflected in this Form 10-K have been presented according to these two new segments, unless otherwise noted. For more information and for financial information about our business segments, including net sales, operating income, Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP financial measure), total assets, and our operations outside the United States, refer to "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (11) Segment Information" included in "Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
We offer advanced secure wireless communications technologies founded on decades of expertise in the satellite communications and cellular markets. We believe these markets are undergoing a period of long-term growth, reinvestment, and rapid technological change. We manage our business through two reportable operating segments: Satellite and Space Communications and Terrestrial and Wireless Networks. Our senior management team supports these business segments by, among other things, actively seeking to identify and leverage synergies that exist between the segments, including in areas such as manufacturing, technology, sales, marketing, customer support and finance. The diagram below summarizes our key products, systems, and services by our two reportable operating segments:

The markets and key technologies for each segment are further described below. 
 Satellite and Space Communications Segment 
Overview
Our Satellite and Space Communications segment designs, builds and supports a variety of sophisticated communications equipment that is designed to meet or exceed the highest standards for performance and quality by businesses and governments worldwide. Applications of our equipment include high-throughput cellular backhaul solutions, modern troposcatter communications equipment, satellite ground station systems, electronic components engineered for use in outer space and high-powered RF/microwave amplifiers and control components. Our customers and end-users include the world’s largest corporations, governments and defense agencies, including the U.S. government. 
Our Satellite and Space Communications segment has four product areas: Satellite Modem and Amplifier Technologies, Troposcatter and SATCOM Solutions, Space Components and Antennas, and High-Power Amplifiers and Switches. 
Satellite Modem and Amplifier Technologies 
We believe we are a leading provider of satellite earth station modems, solid-state amplifiers and traveling wave tube amplifiers. Many of our key satellite earth station modems incorporate forward error correction and bandwidth compression technologies, which enable our customers to optimize their satellite networks by either reducing their satellite transponder lease costs or increasing data throughput. We hold leadership positions in the market for high-throughput modems used in cellular backhaul, a market that has been rapidly growing due to increased mobile phone usage and increasing data throughput demands from LTE and 5G deployments worldwide. 
An estimated 3 billion people globally remain unconnected to any wireless services, representing a significant opportunity. In fiscal 2021, we introduced a Time Division Multiple Access ("TDMA") technology solution which offers best-in-class support for very large satellite networks that use Very Small Aperture Terminals (“VSATs”). This technology allows our customers to cost-effectively provide wireless services to end-users in complex geographies or areas where cellular infrastructure is otherwise unavailable. In fiscal 2022, we introduced ELEVATE™, a revolutionary solution that combines our Heights Dynamic Network Access ("H-DNA") and TDMA technologies into a single VSAT platform that delivers increased value to our customers by enabling private or shared VSAT networks of any size and topology on a single unified platform. To date, although sales cycles are long, we have made good progress in securing several significant orders for ELEVATE™. 
We also provide rugged, highly efficient, and reliable amplifiers for commercial and military applications around the world. These High-Power Amplifiers (“HPAs”) are used in critical communications links on the ground, in the air and on the sea; they support fixed traditional and direct-to-home broadcast, mobile news gathering, transportable and flyaway systems, secure high data rate communications, and broadband access over satcom. These products include configurations that are formally qualified for use on aircraft. 
Finally, we believe we are well-positioned in the millimeter wave ("mmWave") market and expect that market to continue to grow as new satellite constellations move into those higher, less crowded frequencies. The Ka band LEO and MEO amplifiers that we design and manufacture for large commercial customers’ non-GEO constellations represent key strategic wins as we build position in higher frequency bands. 
Troposcatter and SATCOM Solutions 
With persistent threats from state and non-state actors, governments around the world are increasingly seeking ways to mitigate vulnerabilities using information and more reliable communication systems to increase decision-makers’ situational awareness. Many of our mission-critical technologies are part of integrated communication infrastructure systems such as the U.S. military's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (also known as "C5ISR") systems and similarly complex networks for international governments. 
We believe we are a world leader in the design and supply of troposcatter equipment. We have designed, manufactured, and delivered troposcatter systems (sometimes referred to as over-the-horizon ("OTH") microwave products and systems) for over fifty years. 
Our OTH systems, which include our patented forward error correction technology, can transmit video and other broadband applications at high throughputs in the most demanding environments: U.S. and foreign governments use our over-the-horizon microwave systems to, among other things, transmit radar tracking, run C5ISR applications and connect to remote border locations. Additionally, energy companies use our systems to enable communication links for offshore oil rigs and other remote locations, as well as for exploration activities. The Comtech COMET™, introduced two years ago, is a rapidly deployable OTH microwave system that directly addresses a void in capabilities that have long been desired by tactical communications planners: low probability of intercept and low probability of detection (“LPI/LPD”), while providing high reliability, mission essential communications. The COMET™ is capable of being transported in a carrying case by a single individual and set up in under fifteen minutes, extending critical services into areas where there is no communications infrastructure, or the infrastructure has been destroyed. U.S. Special Forces, as well as non-U.S. NATO forces, have already begun procuring and deploying the COMET™ for high reliability, mission essential communications. 
We provide field support sustainment services, centralized and deployed depot services, and technology insertion services to the U.S. Army’s AN/TSC-198 family of communication systems that are commonly referred to as "SNAP" (Secret Internet Protocol Router ("SIPR") and Non-secure Internet Protocol Router ("NIPR") Access Point) VSATs, support for the Army “SCOUT” (Scalable Class of Unified Terminals), and Army T2C2 (Tactical Command Communication). We also provide sustainment services for the U.S. Army’s Blue Force Tracking-1 ("BFT-1") system in addition to support for Army IP networks. Our field support services include providing U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") personnel with curriculum development and training services to support cybersecurity workforce development.
Space Components and Antennas 
For over 45 years, we have been recognized as an industry leader and global supplier of high-reliability products and supply chain management and engineering services, supporting selection of space-qualified parts for satellite and launch vehicle tracking solutions geared for critical NASA programs as well as several international space and defense agencies. Our engineers are not only involved in the design of products, but our technical team is heavily involved with the customer development of electronic parts and testing specifications to assure capability, reliability and radiation tolerance to specific mission/project requirements both as an individual service and for Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical (“EEE”) parts supplied to our customers. We also lead and conduct failure analysis investigations and assist with manufacturing and test problems at the source and support reporting and selloff with the customer and its prime (such as the Japanese Space Exploration Agency (“JAXA”) and NASA). Our quality engineering team assures that the product received from our suppliers and test facilities are compliant to their respective specifications prior to shipment to our end customers. Most recently, our service offerings have been expanded to include kitting to customer Bill of Materials with direct shipments to customer designated contract manufacturers. 
Within the satellite communications market, we are a leading provider of X/Y terminal solutions that fully support the mission requirements of LEO, MEO and GEO satellite communication and tracking requirements, offering a host of high-performance single-band and multi-band feed solutions. We also supply maritime antenna solutions that are fielded by foreign governments. 
High Power Amplifiers and Switches
We offer several unique high-performance transmit and receive technologies used in sophisticated communication systems, including electronic warfare, radar, data link, medical and identification friend or foe ("IFF"). As our customers push the envelope for mobility, speed and frequency, we believe that demand for high-performance transmission products will increase over time. 
Our solid-state, high-power RF microwave amplifiers and related switching control technologies are utilized in many critical applications, including electronic warfare, communications, radar, data link, IFF and medical applications (such as oncology treatment systems). In the electronic warfare marketplace, we support a variety of legacy systems and are participating in the ongoing migration to platforms that require smaller and lighter amplifiers integrated with additional signal processing functionality, providing more complete transmit and receive functionality. Our solutions are designed to increase the flexibility of systems by providing wider bandwidth capabilities to address increased data transmission needs in challenging environments. We also believe the desire for increased airspace situational awareness will create increased opportunities for our radar and IFF products, which are used by government and commercial customers around the world. Our high power and highly reliable Gallium Nitride ("GaN") amplifier technology is increasingly used both to update existing radar systems for improved sensitivity and range, as well as for new radar applications and installations. In addition to technologies that enhance performance of primary radars, we also supply solutions for IFF systems that provide positive identification of radar targets for secondary surveillance systems. 
Satellite and Space Communications: Key Markets and Growth Drivers 
Combined, our Satellite and Space Communications segment offers our customers one-stop-shopping for sophisticated satellite ground station technologies and solutions, including SCPC and TDMA modems, amplifiers, antennas, frequency converters and network software for customers who utilize satellite communications. Our products are used to modulate, demodulate and amplify signals, carry voice, video and/or data over networks and are vital to satellite communication applications, including air-to-ground communications, video broadcasting and the backhaul of cellular traffic. Our Satellite and Space Communications segment manufactures most of the satellite ground station equipment we sell to our customers. 
We believe that the overall satellite ground station equipment industry will grow from current levels and will be increasingly combined with existing and new cellular networks. This growth is expected to occur because of widespread deployment of, and upgrades to, 4G and 5G ground-based systems, including satellite earth stations, as well as the integration of high-performance amplifiers necessary to meet long-term demand for high-performance satellite communications applications, such as satellite-based wireless backhaul, DTH, HD and 4K broadcasting, and in-flight connectivity. We believe that Comtech is well-positioned to capitalize on this demand through sales of our market-leading satellite ground station technologies, including new next-generation satellite earth station technologies that can be used with the thousands of new LEO, MEO and large HTS satellite constellations that are expected to be deployed over the next several years. 
Examples of end-market applications that are driving long-term demand for our satellite-based communication technologies include: 
•New LEO, MEO and HTS Satellites: Thousands of new satellites are reportedly being launched over the next several years, according to announcements by companies including Telesat Lightspeed, OneWeb, SpaceX Starlink, Amazon Kuiper and Viasat, which we believe will lead to increasingly complex satellite networks. As service providers work to offer connectivity to these high-speed, high-bandwidth satellites and expand their networks to handle the demand for new LEO, MEO and HTS applications, we believe our ELEVATE™, HeightsTM and UHP networking platforms, our solid-state amplifiers and our X/Y antennas will ultimately be incorporated into many new installations and equipment upgrades. We continue to provide modems and amplifiers to existing LEO and MEO communications satellite providers and expect to see growth in imaging satellites alongside commercial imaging constellations, including conventional, thermal, and hyperspectral. 
•Satellite-Based Cellular Backhaul: Demand for satellite-based cellular backhaul services is anticipated to grow rapidly as a result of the increased penetration of smart cellular phones and network upgrades to 4G and 5G in developing regions of the world. Ultimately, as 5G services continue to be deployed, we expect that mobile data services will become more critical. As mobile data penetration expands and mobile data consumption increases, wireless carriers must invest in their mobile network infrastructures, and we believe businesses will require back-up communications. In developing regions of the world, and in remote areas where terrestrial network infrastructure is lacking (or where challenging geography prohibits it), wireless network operators often backhaul, or transport, their wireless data traffic using satellite-based networking technologies. Comtech is well positioned to serve the high-performance, high availability needs of satellite-based cellular backhaul through sales of our SCPC and TDMA satellite modems as well as our HeightsTM , ELEVATETM and UHP networking platforms. 
•Government and Military Satellite Communications: Government users rely on high-speed connectivity in a variety of conditions throughout the world to provide real time information sharing, including Situational Awareness (“SA”), dissemination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (“ISR”) information, and communications. Our communications solutions provide command and control and satellite networking capabilities that support U.S. and allied government initiatives for assured and resilient communications capabilities, as well as supporting interoperability objectives, including the Joint All Domain Command and Control (“JADC2”) efforts. 
•Enterprise Networks and Internet of Things (“IoT”): Satellite services are increasingly used for Machine-to-Machine data connectivity for both critical infrastructure applications such as utility companies (electrical grid, oil rigs, gas pipelines, water companies) as well as IoT networks. Comtech TDMA equipment is widely used in these applications, where it delivers superior network availability (by making use of geographical hub redundancy and other technologies), and high Quality of Service (“QoS”). 
Terrestrial and Wireless Networks Segment 
Overview 
Our Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segment is a leading provider of the hardware, software, and solutions critical to any modern 911 public safety and mobile network operator (“MNO”) infrastructure, as well as for applications services requiring the specific location of a mobile user's geospatial position. From the moment a 911 call is made, Comtech provides highly reliable solutions that contribute to emergency calls being processed instantly, with proper routing to first responders. Our solutions include feature-rich data sets (such as: precise location information, route optimization, text messaging, photos and real-time video), putting first responders in the best possible position to make decisions when every second counts. Our customers are the businesses, communities and governments that need to implement and improve 911 infrastructure in the U.S., as well as MNOs in the U.S. and abroad that have a need to determine subscriber location within a network or to facilitate messaging services. In 2021, we were recognized by Frost & Sullivan, a leading third-party research firm, for registering the most significant year-over-year market share increase among all NG-911 primary contract holders. As such, we believe that we are a leader in public safety communication and location technologies. 
The Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segment is organized into four product areas: Next Generation 911 & Call Delivery, Solacom Call Handling Solutions, Trusted Location and Messaging Solutions, and Cyber Security Training & Services. 
Next Generation 911 & Call Delivery 
In addition to 911 call routing, we provide systems integration, geospatial location information, satellite and location infrastructure terminals, and linkage to NG-911 Emergency Services IP Networks ("ESInet"). We also offer what we believe are best-in-class 911 call handling solutions under the Solacom brand name. We believe state and local governments need to upgrade existing legacy networks, location technologies, and call handling systems to modern NG-911 systems infrastructure, including 911 text messaging services, advanced data, real-time photos, and other types of information sharing over IP networks. 
As the U.S. and Canada broadly adopt upgraded NG-911 and call handling solutions, we believe that other countries will follow similar technology and telecommunications advancements. Comtech’s public safety and location technology solutions have been deployed since 2006 and are utilized by domestic MNOs, as well as internationally, to provide reliable device location determination for public safety and commercial applications. Many of our technologies, such as positioning, mapping, and text messaging, are embedded in our public safety and location offerings to help address mapping, routing, and geolocations. Our solutions address Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") mandates for emergency services as they relate to location delivery by supporting precise caller location. Our text messaging platforms are used by wireless carriers to provide short messaging services (“SMS”) to their end-customers as well as being used to communicate with 911 public safety answering points (“PSAPs”). 
Solacom Call Handling Solutions 
We offer what we believe is a best-in-class call handling solution marketed under the Solacom Guardian brand name, which provides an integrated text-to-and-from 911 solution on a unified platform. The solution provides a flexible user interface, adapts to varying customer environments and preferences, provides powerful call conferencing capabilities, enhanced reporting capabilities and offers geospatial 911 location call display directly from a customized map. Because of its advanced features, it allows us to offer an immediate upgrade path to existing and new customers and has expanded our presence in the public safety solutions market with more than 700 PSAPs and emergency call centers installed in 5 countries. 
The Guardian platform includes an integrated cloud-based texting solution (“Guardian Messenger”) which provides call takers / dispatchers with the ability to collect, process and share previously unavailable live incident information such as text, photos, and video via SMS and multimedia messaging services (“MMS”), from one integrated desktop. The Guardian platform also offers a cloud-based reporting and analytics solution (“Guardian Insights”), designed to assist emergency call center directors to know their operations, so they can better plan and manage resources and workloads. 
We are investing in product enhancements for our Guardian platform including additional cloud-based capabilities, analytics, and cyber security solutions. We have significantly increased our “911-as-a-Service" (“911aaS”) offering, deploying hosted 911 call centers solutions across numerous states and regions in the U.S. and provinces in Canada. 
Trusted Location and Messaging Solutions 
We believe that as the industry moves toward digital transformation, customers will be looking for situational awareness solutions that are built on top of mapping and geo-services. Our location technology solutions enable the determination of a mobile phone's geospatial position in a variety of environments, leveraging a wide range of signals including Global Positioning System ("GPS"), Global Navigation Satellite Systems ("GNSS") and multiple cellular positioning technologies ranging from 2G through 5G mobile networks. For our installed base of systems, we provide ongoing operational support, including administration of system components, system optimization, configuration management and maintenance services, including tracking customer support issues, troubleshooting, and developing and installing maintenance releases. 
Our Location StudioTM platform enables customers, particularly public safety agencies, to build their own applications with end-user functionality, such as maps, search, geocoding, routing, and navigation, using their own brand. We believe that customers and prospects are increasingly looking for alternatives to mapping services that are subject to change by the provider, and which meet market privacy and security requirements. The Location StudioTM platform is a complete end-to-end location application consisting of maps, map data, including our Trusted OpenStreetMap ("TOSM") geo-services, application program interfaces ("APIs") and software development kits ("SDKs") enabling public safety ecosystems and enterprises to customize unique mapping applications. Map data includes positioning, search, enhanced local content, custom maps, navigation, geo-fencing, tracking integrated with third party data sources like camera feeds and IoT sensor data via cross-platform APIs and SDKs supporting all leading operating systems. 
In fiscal 2022, we began marketing SmartResponseTM, a newly developed cloud-based solution that offers a common operational picture to PSAPs and first responders, enabling an effective data-driven response for security agencies and first responders by providing a holistic information environment for them. This new solution offers streaming live feeds from traffic cameras at and near incident location, and accesses caller information like past residences, criminal history, or next-of-kin information at the tap of a button. Offering a bird's-eye view of integrated data, the SmartResponseTM solution empowers first responders to ensure appropriate resources are on the scene and to better serve the public in emergency situations. 
Cyber Security Training & Services 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, Comtech launched a new cybersecurity brand, CyberStronger™, to provide cybersecurity solutions and services tailored to threat monitoring and assessment, training, and workforce development. Offerings include cyber threat detection and management, off-the-shelf and custom training, hands-on skills labs, and competency-based assessments mapped to cybersecurity job roles. The CyberStronger™ solutions also include the CYBRScore® set of products that provide hands-on assessments and training to upskill and reskill cybersecurity workforces. These solutions were created by a team of former national intelligence community members who have the practical cybersecurity experience and abilities required to meet the demanding needs of Comtech’s customer base which includes government entities, large universities, and enterprise-level corporations. 
Our offerings are suitable for both technical and non-technical teams to close the skills gap in the cyber security field and also provide continuous feedback and evidence to the organizations about their teams’ proficiency. Our PerformanScore® is a performance-based scoring platform that uniquely and adaptively measures skills across a range of credible responses to a defined set of tasks, allowing for a consistent and immediate evaluation. 
Terrestrial and Wireless Networks: Key Markets and Growth Drivers 
We are a leading provider of modern public safety and location technologies. Our next generation solutions enable rich, multimedia information to be delivered alongside 911 calls. Also, our E911 and NG-911 call routing solutions allow cellular carriers and voice over the Internet ("VoIP") carriers, as well as legacy telecommunications carriers, to deliver emergency calls to public safety emergency call centers nationwide. When someone places an emergency call, our technologies identify the call as an emergency call, access the user’s location information from the wireless or VoIP networks and location databases, and route the call to the assigned public safety jurisdiction. Today, we provide public safety and location technologies to many U.S. telecommunication carriers, the largest being Verizon (for which we provide 911 call routing via cellular service). We believe we service a significant portion of the carrier market for 911 cellular call routing applications, along with one other leading competitor. 
With the advent of 5G networks, new network-based positioning technologies are poised to deliver opportunities thanks to the ongoing digital transformation of multiple industry verticals, including the Public Safety, Transportation, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Retail industries. As these industries increasingly rely on data from connected devices, using location information in real-time is expected to enhance existing business processes and outcomes as well as end user experiences. We believe end-market applications such as worker’s safety in high-risk areas, smart manufacturing, and autonomous driving would benefit enormously from new precision-positioning techniques. Also, MNOs can now provide even more advanced location-based services, in addition to existing connectivity solutions. 
Examples of end-market applications that are driving long-term demand for our Terrestrial and Wireless Networks technologies include: 
•Our XyPoint® Mobile Location Platform: Provided to MNOs globally, our virtualized location-based services (“LBS”) platform is a high availability robust solution with multiple positioning technologies, that allows authorized users to locate and track specific mobile devices and monitor specific areas of interest. MNOs can use this platform for location accuracy to support a wide variety of use cases, including public safety, location intelligence, network optimization and big data analytics. On the legacy front, our LBS platform is compatible within 2G through 4G wireless networks, as well as an enabler to the MNOs to seamlessly migrate to cloud native environments, as they start their migrations to 5G. 
•Comtech INSIGHTS™ LightSource™: Provides first responders a reporting and analytics platform for the rich data created in Comtech’s NG-911 core systems. Authorized users at state, regional, and jurisdiction organizations can see reports and analysis of call, behavior, and location characteristics in both time and geospatial visualizations. Users are able to interact directly with the visualization in real time to focus on desired characteristics to include timeframes, call types, media types, and other information. Authorized users can also schedule reports for automatic delivery via email. 
•Comtech INSIGHTS™ SmartResponse™: Provides first responders of all types (fire, police, medical, state, regional emergency communications centers, dispatch centers, emergency management agencies, fusion cells, intelligence centers, etc.) access to real-time 911 call information and related supplemental information for situational awareness in a geospatial, mapped context. Authorized users can view 911 calls and emergency response vehicles/assets in a 3-D map via a single pane of glass view to enhance response. SmartResponse™ is available for use in both emergency centers and response vehicles. 
•Wireless Emergency Alerts (“WEA”): WEA, also known as Commercial Mobile Alerts System (“CMAS”) in the US, enable authorized officials to inform the public about life-threatening events by automatically delivering emergency alerts to mobile devices (including roaming users) via the government alert gateway. Using standardized infrastructure, ensuring compliance with government regulations globally, our patented technology facilitates the origination and accurate delivery of geo-targeted emergency alerts, empowering emergency services providers to better serve the public. Using this technology, for example, MNOs can quickly broadcast emergency communications, such as severe weather alerts, to all devices in a specific geographical area. 
Synergies: Opportunities in Convergence 
We believe that significant advances in technology have been driving a convergence across multiple aspects of the Terrestrial and Wireless Networks market and the Satellite and Space Communications market. We believe we have an advantage in having identified this convergence, and in combining our native expertise in both to develop innovative new products and solutions to meet growing customer demands. Broadly, the increasing digitization of people and businesses, and the ongoing migration to the cloud, means a growing reliance on communications and connectivity, and a corresponding increase in the volumes of data transmission. We believe this is a long-term secular opportunity for Comtech given our market-leading positions in, and understanding of, the fast-evolving Failsafe Communications markets. 
We are watching in real-time as the once clear line separating terrestrial and non-terrestrial communications networks is dissolving. The need for connectivity (more precisely: constant, reliable connectivity) is growing on a worldwide basis. People, devices, and machines need constant connectivity, regardless of whether they are proximate to a cellular tower. Because of this, satellite communications are increasingly bridging gaps created by challenging geographies, or a lack of terrestrial infrastructure altogether. Comtech is increasingly delivering solutions to companies and countries seeking to bridge these gaps, whether across legacy 4G networks, or through the introduction of 5G networks, as operators seek ways to optimize implementation, control costs, and mitigate security risks. We expect the convergence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks to continue, leveraging the increasing numbers and density of satellite constellations to meet the growing terrestrial demand to connect and move more data, more quickly, reliably, and efficiently than ever. 
Our Diverse Global Customer Base 
We have established long-standing relationships with thousands of customers worldwide, including leading system and network suppliers in the global satellite, mobile cellular, defense, broadcast and aerospace industries, as well as the U.S. federal government (including the U.S. Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy), U.S. state and local governments, and foreign governments.

We also use social media channels to communicate with customers and the public about our Company, our products, services, and other issues, and we use social media and the Internet to communicate with investors, including information about our stockholder meetings. Information and updates about our Annual Meetings will continue to be posted on our website at www.comtech.com in the "Investor Relations" section. 
None of the information on our website, blog or any other website identified herein is incorporated by reference in this annual report and such information should not be considered a part of this annual report. 
Acquisitions
In order to position ourselves to take advantage of additional growth opportunities and meet our strategic objectives, we have followed, and will continue to follow, a disciplined approach in identifying, executing and capitalizing on acquisitions of businesses and enabling technologies. Material acquisitions in the past several years include:
On January 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of CGC Technology Limited ("CGC"), a small privately held company located in the United Kingdom. CGC is a leading provider of high-precision full-motion fixed and mobile X/Y satellite tracking antennas, reflectors, RF feeds, radomes and other ground station equipment for customers around the world. The acquisition brought established relationships with several top-tier European aerospace companies and other government entities, and we expect it to allow us to participate in the anticipated growth in the number of LEO and MEO satellite constellations. The aggregate purchase price for accounting purposes for the acquisition of CGC was $23.7 million and CGC was fully integrated into our Satellite and Space Communications segment.
On March 2, 2021, we completed our acquisition of UHP Networks Inc. ("UHP"), a leading provider of innovative and disruptive satellite ground station technology solutions. With end-markets for high-speed satellite-based networks anticipated to significantly grow, our acquisition allows us to enhance our offerings with TDMA satellite modems. The aggregate purchase price for accounting purposes for the acquisition of UHP was $37.5 million and UHP was fully integrated into our Satellite and Space Communications segment.
Sales, Marketing and Customer Support
Sales and marketing strategies include direct sales through sales, marketing and engineering personnel, indirect sales through independent representatives, value-added resellers, and sales through a combination of the foregoing. We devote resources to evaluating and responding to requests for proposals by governmental agencies around the world and, as needed, we employ the use of specialized consultants to develop our proposals and bids.
We intend to continue to expand international marketing efforts by engaging additional independent sales representatives, distributors and value-added resellers and by establishing foreign sales offices. In addition, we expect to leverage our relationships with larger companies (such as prime contractors to the U.S. government and large mobile wireless operators) to market our technology solutions. In fiscal 2023, we expect to continue expanding our social media and Internet presence and developing an updated marketing and branding strategy.
We are pre-qualified as an approved vendor for certain government contracts. We collaborate in sales efforts under various arrangements with integrators. Our marketing efforts also include advertising, public relations, speaking engagements and attending and sponsoring industry conferences. 
Our management, technical and marketing personnel establish and maintain relationships with customers. Our sales strategies include a commitment to providing ongoing customer support for our systems and equipment. This support involves providing direct access to engineering staff or trained technical representatives to resolve technical or operational issues.
Our products and services in many of our product lines have long sales cycles. Once a product is designed into a system, customers may be reluctant to change the incumbent supplier due to the extensive qualification process and potential redesign required in using alternative sources. In addition, in recent years, we have found that overall sales cycles for each of our product lines have significantly increased.
Sales by geography and customer type, as a percentage of related net sales, are as follows:

 | Fiscal Years Ended July 31, 
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020

Sales to U.S. government customers include sales to the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as sales directly to or through prime contractors. 
Domestic sales include sales to commercial customers, as well as to U.S. state and local governments. Included in domestic sales are sales to Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon"), which represented 11.1% and 10.7% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Except for the U.S. government, there were no customers that represented more than 10.0% of consolidated net sales during fiscal 2020. 
International sales for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $121.4 million, $138.9 million and $145.1 million, respectively. When we sell internationally, we denominate most of our contracts in U.S. dollars. Some of our sales to international customers are paid for by letters of credit or on an open account. From time to time, some of our international customers may require us to provide performance guarantees. 
Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
Backlog
Our backlog as of July 31, 2022 was $618.1 million (of which $192.4 million was attributed to the Satellite and Space Communications segment and $425.7 million was attributed to the Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segment). We estimate that a substantial portion of the backlog as of July 31, 2022 will be recognized as sales during the next twenty-four month period, with the rest thereafter.
At July 31, 2022, 72.7% of our backlog consisted of orders for use by U.S. commercial customers, 11.6% consisted of U.S. government contracts, subcontracts and government funded programs and 15.7% consisted of orders for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers).
Our backlog is defined as orders (sometimes also referred to herein as bookings) that we believe to be firm. Backlog that is derived from U.S. government orders relates to U.S. government contracts that have been awarded, signed and funded. Backlog for our U.S. government customers also includes amounts appropriated by Congress and allotted to the contract by the procuring government agency. Our backlog does not include the value of options that may be exercised in the future on multi-year contracts, nor does it include the value of additional purchase orders that we may receive under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ("IDIQ") contracts or basic ordering agreements. In some cases, such as contracts received from large U.S. based telecommunication companies, our backlog may include the value of customer authorizations to proceed or may be computed by multiplying the most recent month’s contract or revenue by the months remaining under the existing long-term agreements, which we consider to be the best available information for anticipating revenue under those agreements. When we acquire a company with existing contracts, we only record bookings for those contracts that meet our definition. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to modification, cancellation at the convenience of the customer, or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract.
Please see Item 1A – “Risk Factors” under Part I of this Form 10-K for more information about risks pertaining to recognition of our backlog.
A significant portion of the backlog from our U.S. commercial customers relates to large, multi-year contracts to provide state and local governments (and their agencies) with 911 public safety and location technology solutions. Although the contracts themselves represent legal, binding obligations of these governments, funding is often subject to the approval of budgets (for example, on an annual or bi-annual basis). Although funding for these multi-year contracts is dependent on future budgets being approved, we include the full estimated value of these large, multi-year contracts in our backlog given the critical nature of the services being provided and the positive historical experience of our state and local government customers passing their respective budgets.
There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, or that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. There is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog. The actual amount and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual recognition of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change, a customer may not follow up with order details (e.g., delivery instructions), fluctuations in currency exchange rates after an order is placed could cause our products to become too expensive for a foreign customer, a customer’s program could be canceled, a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early due to changes in a customer’s priorities, funding may not be included in future budgets, actual indirect rates being reimbursed on U.S. government contracts may ultimately be less than those indirect rates included in our initial proposals, or an option that we had assumed would be exercised is not exercised. As a result of these contingencies, we may adjust our backlog if we determine that such orders are no longer firm and/or funded. In addition to adjustments from these types of contingencies, variations in backlog from time to time are attributable, in part, to changes in sales mix, the timing of contract proposals, the timing of contract awards, delivery schedules on specific contracts and new bookings obtained through acquisitions. A large majority of the solutions in our satellite ground station technologies product line within our Satellite and Space Communications segment operate under short lead times. Backlog in both our Satellite and Space Communications segment and Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segment and has been, and could be, highly influenced by the nature and timing of orders received from federal, state and local governments and defense-related agencies, causing such orders to be subject to unpredictable funding, deployment and technology decisions by such customers. As a result, we believe our backlog and orders, at any point in time, are not necessarily indicative of the total sales anticipated for any future period.
Research and Development
We have established leading technology positions in our fields through internal and customer-funded research and development activities.
Internal research and development expenses are reported as research and development expenses for financial reporting purposes and were $52.5 million, $49.1 million and $52.2 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing 10.8%, 8.4% and 8.5% of total consolidated net sales, respectively, for these periods. Customer-funded research and development activities relate to the adaptation of our basic technology to specialized customer requirements which is recoverable under contracts and is reflected in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales. Certain of our government customers also contract with us from time to time to conduct research on telecommunications software, equipment and systems. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we were reimbursed by customers for such activities in the amounts of $9.8 million, $13.6 million and $11.9 million, respectively. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we incurred $1.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of strategic emerging technology costs for next-generation satellite technology to advance our solutions offerings to be used with new broadband satellite constellations. We are evaluating this new market in relation to our long-term business strategies, and likely to incur additional costs in fiscal 2023. 
Intellectual Property
We rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how, continuing technological innovation and, with respect to certain key technologies, patents to develop and maintain our competitive position. The products we sell require significant engineering design and manufacturing expertise. For technological capabilities that are not protected by patents or licenses, we generally rely on the expertise of our employees and our learned experiences in both the design and manufacture of our products and the delivery of our services.
Some of our key Satellite and Space Communications segment technology is protected by patents that are significant to protecting our proprietary technology. We have been issued several U.S. patents relating to forward error correction technology that is utilized in our TPC-enabled satellite modems. Due to our market leadership position, we do not expect that upon expiration of these patents, our future results will be negatively impacted.
We have a portfolio of several hundred patents worldwide relating to wireless location services, text messaging, GPS ephemeris data, emergency public safety data routing, electronic commerce and other areas. To-date, our strategy has been to avoid offensive and defensive patent litigation and focus on building meaningful partnerships with other companies through direct licensing, cross licensing, and other forms of agreements. We do not believe that any single patent or group of patents, patent application or patent license agreement is material to our operations.
We have filed additional patent applications for certain apparatus and processes we believe we have invented covering key features of location services, wireless text alerts, SMS Center, mobile-originated data and E911 network software. There is no assurance that any patent application will result in a patent being issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other patent offices, nor is there any guarantee that any issued patent will be valid and enforceable. Additionally, foreign patent rights may or may not be available or pursued in any technology area for which U.S. patent applications have been filed. 
Almost all the products and services we sell to the U.S. government include technology and other technical know-how that we have internally developed. In past instances where we have provided government-purpose rights, to our knowledge, the U.S. government has not exercised any of these rights. To the extent that we have provided or will provide government-purpose rights in the future, we believe that given the rapidly changing nature of our technology, our future success will depend primarily on the technical competence and creative skill of our personnel, rather than any contractual protection.
Competition
Our businesses are highly competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. Some of our competitors are substantially larger, have significantly greater financial, marketing, research and development, technological and operating resources and broader product lines than we have. Other companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition. A significant technological breakthrough by others, including new companies, our existing competitors and our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies.
Some large defense-based companies, such as Northrop Grumman Corporation, have subsidiaries or divisions that compete against us in one or more business segments. In addition, new and potential competitors are always emerging. Certain of our customers, such as prime contractors who currently outsource their engineering and manufacturing requirements to us, have technological capabilities in our product areas and could choose to replace our products with products they develop. In some cases, we partner or team with companies (both large and mid-tier) to compete against other teams for large defense programs. In some cases, these same companies may be among our competitors.
Listed below, in alphabetical order, are some of our competitors in each of our two business segments:
Satellite and Space Communications – ACTIA Group, Advantech Co., Ltd., Aethercomm Inc., Agilis Satcom, AMERGINT Technologies, Inc., AnaCom, Inc., Codan Limited, CPI International, Inc., Datum Systems, Inc., dB Control Corp. (a subsidiary of HEICO Corp.), ENENSYS Technologies, ETM Electromatic Inc., Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd., Empower RF Systems, Inc., Envistacom, LLC, General Dynamics Corporation, Hughes Network Systems, LLC (a subsidiary of EchoStar), KVH Industries, Inc., L3Harris Technologies, Inc., Mission Microwave Technologies, LLC, ND Satcom GmbH, Panasonic Corporation, Paradise Datacom Ltd. (a subsidiary of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated), Raytheon Technologies Corporation, SatixFy Israel Ltd., ST Engineering iDirect, Inc. (including Newtec), Terrasat Communications Inc., and ViaSat, Inc.
Terrestrial and Wireless Networks – AT&T Inc., Atos, Bandwidth.com, CalAmp Corp., Carbyne, Central Square Technologies, 8x8, Inc., Everbridge, Inc., Google Inc. (a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.), Here Technologies, Immersive Labs, INdigital, Intrado Corporation (formerly West Corporation), LM Ericsson, Lumen Technologies, Inc. (formerly CenturyLink, Inc.), Mobile Arts AB, Motorola Solutions, Inc., NGA911, Nokia Networks (a subsidiary of Nokia Corporation), RapidDeploy, Inc., Rave Mobile Safety, Sinch AB (Inteliquent), Synergem Technologies, ThriveDX, and TomTom N.V.
We believe that competition in all our markets is based primarily on technology innovation, product performance, reputation, delivery times, customer support and price. Due to our proprietary know-how, we believe we can develop, produce and deliver products and services on a cost-effective basis faster than many of our competitors.
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
We recognize the need for driving corporate responsibility within our organization, throughout our supplier network and in our communities. To drive this responsibility, we will continue to target effective corporate governance, ethical behavior in the workplace and social responsibility, while also updating and enhancing this focus with initiatives, such as:
•refreshing the roles and responsibilities of the committees of our Board of Directors, including with the establishment of an Environment, Social and Governance ("ESG") task force supervised by our Board of Directors,
•developing a company-wide People Strategy to foster and promote workplace talent and diversity, and
•organizing a company-wide strategic sourcing group that will be accountable for tracking and driving resource reduction targets, such as resource-efficient manufacturing, reduction of hazardous substances, and take-back, recycling and reuse of products.
Human Capital
We realize that our employees are one of our most valuable assets and believe our success depends on the talent we attract and retain, which is why we are developing what we call our People Strategy. We are passionate about building meaningful employee engagement and happiness in a variety of ways that will be addressed in our People Strategy, including providing a foundation for a diverse, inclusive and equitable workplace where employees feel they belong; developing and promoting talent; supporting a competitive benefits program; and enforcing the importance of our employees’ health, safety and wellness. 
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging 
We believe a diverse, equitable, inclusive workplace is critical to our ability to develop innovative solutions and is key to the future of our success. We encourage employees to be inspired and strive for them to feel like they belong. We focus on expanding our diverse workforce by reaching out to institutions promoting the employment of minorities, attending recruiting events aimed at attracting talent of diverse heritage and veteran backgrounds, as well as by considering diversity of our workforce during our talent, promotion, and succession planning. Through these and other efforts, during fiscal 2022, two additional female executives were hired onto our executive leadership team, including our first female Chief Operating Officer. Three female professionals were also recently appointed to our Board of Directors ("Board") (which currently consists of 37.5% female and 62.5% male Board members). Additionally, in fiscal 2022, a member of our executive leadership team was recognized as an honoree for diversity in business based on such individual's efforts in our organization and the community. 
Our leadership team identified several company-wide diversity initiatives such as celebrating Black History Month, Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month, International Women’s Day and Pride Month, where employees and their families are encouraged to participate, celebrate, and showcase their views, culture, and history on our social media and company-wide communication platforms. When unique stories are celebrated, employees feel connected in meaningful ways and support each other to reach our full potential.

Talent
To meet and execute our strategic business goals, we are focused on sourcing, attracting, and retaining top talent, especially those with engineering, science, and technical backgrounds. We recognize and reward performance while continually developing, engaging and retaining high-performing employees. We have made significant investments to provide ongoing training and career development by offering courses on our online learning management system. We offer job-specific skills training to promote and develop advancement within the organization and to enhance skills. Training in and compliance with our Standards of Business Conduct and Trade and FCPA compliance is also mandatory among our employees.
Through certain government contracts that we participate in, we partner with our end customer to provide enlisted, active military personnel (whose service is expected to end within 6 months) onsite training to help them with a successful transition to a civilian life. Also, in an effort to retain and attract new talent, we partner with local universities to hire interns throughout our organization. During fiscal 2022, we engaged several interns throughout the company with interests ranging from procurement, engineering, and legal practice. 
At July 31, 2022, we had 1,993 employees (including temporary employees and contractors), 1,143 of whom were engaged in production and production support, 498 in research and development and other engineering support, and 352 in marketing and administrative functions. None of our U.S. based employees are represented by a labor union. Of our 1,993 employees, 496 employees are based outside of the United States, including 148 employees in the United Kingdom, 139 employees in India and 138 employees in Canada. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Safety and Wellness
We strive to maintain a robust health, safety and wellness program to ensure a healthy work environment, promote workforce resiliency, and enhance business value. We encourage employee participation to identify opportunities for improvement and review and monitor our performance with safety committees on the local level. Local safety committees identify safety programs and ensure completion of all training and target learning objectives. 
We continue to review our business models to support flexible working arrangements, where possible, to meet the needs of our employees and our business. We continue to review CDC guidelines to monitor safety measures in all facilities in light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.
Employee wellness is important to Comtech. All employees and their households have access to an employee assistance program, as well as a health advocate program to help with all aspects of benefits, family life, financial concerns, legal issues and transition to retirement. Assistance is available 365 days per year, 24 hours per day.
We rigorously review our benefit and compensation plans to maintain competitive packages that reflect the wellness needs of our workforce and the marketplace. These programs include 401(k) plans, health and welfare benefits, among many others. We support pay equity for all employees within the same geographic area, experience level, and performance standards. 
Environment
We encourage our employees to respect our environment. To compound these efforts, we offer recycling bins at our facilities and encourage employees to use environmentally friendly commuting options such as mass transit (providing company sponsored mass transit cards) and share ride programs. Where appropriate, we also consider work from home arrangements to eliminate commuting altogether. In 2022, we celebrated Earth Day in our company by encouraging our global employees to participate in environmentally-focused initiatives and then share their activities on social media.
U.S. Government Contracts and Security Clearances
The U.S. government operates on an October-to-September fiscal year. Generally, in February of each year, the President of the United States presents to the U.S. Congress ("Congress") the proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year and from February through September of each year, the appropriations and authorization committees of Congress review the President’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. Once these levels are enacted into law, the Executive Office of the President administers the funds to the agencies. Thereafter, we can receive orders pursuant to sole-source or competitively awarded contracts, which we describe below.
The U.S. government may be unable to complete its budget process before the end of any given government fiscal year and when the fiscal budget is not approved in a timely manner, the U.S. government is required either to shut down or be funded pursuant to a "continuing resolution" that authorizes agencies of the U.S. government to continue operations but does not authorize new spending initiatives, either of which could result in reduced or delayed orders or payments for products and services we provide.
Sole-source contracts are generally awarded to a single contractor without a formal competition when a single contractor is deemed to have an expertise or technology superior to that of competing contractors or when there is an urgent need by the U.S. government that cannot wait for a full competitive process. Potential suppliers compete informally through research and development and marketing efforts. Competitively-bid contracts are awarded based on a formal proposal evaluation established by the procuring agency and interested contractors prepare bids. Competitively-bid contracts are awarded after a formal bid and proposal competition among suppliers.
The U.S. government has a stated policy direction to reduce the number of sole-source contract awards across all procuring agencies. In addition, the U.S. government is increasing the use of multiple-award IDIQ contracts to increase its procurement options. IDIQ contracts allow the U.S. government to select a group of eligible contractors for the same program. When the government awards IDIQ contracts to multiple bidders under the same program, a company that has already competed to be selected as a participant in the program must subsequently compete for individual delivery orders. As a result of this U.S. government shift toward multiple award IDIQ contracts, we expect to face greater competition for future U.S. government contracts and, at the same time, greater opportunities for us to participate in program areas that we do not currently participate in.
As a U.S. government contractor and subcontractor, we are subject to a variety of rules and regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FAR"). Individual agencies can also have acquisition regulations. For example, the Department of Defense implements the FAR through the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation supplement (commonly known as "DFARs"). For all Federal government entities, the FAR regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition, including: acquisition planning, competition requirements, contractor qualifications, protection of source selection and vendor information, and acquisition procedures. In addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of supplier costs, while Cost Accounting Standards address how those costs can be allocated to contracts. The FAR also subjects suppliers to audits and other government reviews. These reviews cover issues such as cost, performance and accounting practices relating to our contracts. The government may challenge a supplier's costs and fees. Suppliers are also required to comply with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual which relates to the handling of classified materials and programs and is administered by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (“DCSA”). Suppliers who do not comply with these various regulations may lose and/or become ineligible for facility security clearances and/or participation in classified programs.
Under firm fixed-price contracts, we perform for an agreed-upon price and we can derive benefits from cost savings, but bear the risk of cost overruns. Our cost-reimbursable type contracts typically provide for reimbursement of allowable costs incurred plus a negotiated fee. Cost-plus-incentive-fee orders typically provide for sharing with the U.S. government savings accrued from orders performed for less than the target costs and costs incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated ceiling price (which is higher than the target cost), and for the supplier to carry the entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price. 
In fiscal 2022, $132.6 million or 27.2% of our consolidated net sales were to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government). Of this amount, firm fixed-price and cost-reimbursable type contracts (including fixed-fee, incentive-fee and time and material type contracts) accounted for approximately $105.5 million and $27.1 million, respectively. 
Regulatory Matters
In addition to the rules and regulations that pertain to us as a U.S. government contractor and subcontractor, we are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations.
Our products that are incorporated into wireless communications systems must comply with various government regulations, including those of the FCC. Our manufacturing facilities, which may store, handle, emit, generate and dispose of hazardous substances that are used in the manufacture of our products, are subject to a variety of local, state and federal regulations, including those issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. Our products are also subject to European Union directives related to the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment. 
Our international sales are subject to U.S. and foreign regulations such as the Arms Export Control Act, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ("IEEPA"), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"), the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), the Department of Commerce ("DoC") as well as other applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses, and such failure would materially adversely affect our operations. If we are unable to receive appropriate export authorizations in the future, we may be prohibited from selling our products and services internationally, which may limit our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need an export license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be materially adversely affected. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other local laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including disgorgement of profits, fines, and criminal sanctions against us, our officers, our directors, or our employees, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of any of the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements could further restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers, including the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries under the IEEPA or similar legislation could negatively impact our business.
In the past, we have self-reported violations of export control laws or regulations to the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ("DDTC"), DoC and OFAC. In addition, we have made various commitments to U.S. government agencies that oversee trade and export matters that we will maintain certain policies and procedures including maintaining a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance and conducting ongoing internal assessments and reporting any future violations to those agencies.
Our financial reporting, corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices are governed by laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, and rules and regulations issued by the SEC. The SEC has adopted rules which require, among other things, public companies to conduct certain inquiries to determine whether or not Conflict Minerals (as that term is defined in the SEC rules) that are necessary to the functionality of their manufactured products or their product's production processes originated in a Covered Country (as that term is defined in the SEC rules) and ultimately file a report with the SEC. Conflict Minerals are widely used in many industries, including the telecommunications industry and almost all of our products include component parts purchased from third-party suppliers and we must rely heavily on information received from suppliers to determine the origin of those materials. We have implemented a due diligence program consistent with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines to collect information concerning the country of origin of Conflict Minerals and in that regard, have adopted a policy that requires our suppliers (both public and private) to commit to a code of conduct relating to the responsible sourcing of minerals and to establish a policy to reasonably assure that the products they manufacture do not contain Conflict Minerals that originated in a Covered Country. Efforts to comply with this SEC rule have resulted in additional costs to us and, we believe, to our suppliers. As such, the availability of raw materials used in our operations could be negatively impacted and/or raw material prices could increase. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage and could harm our reputation.
Laws and regulations have been enacted that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including the European General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). The GDPR imposes certain privacy related requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are currently different than those in the United States and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are several legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for personal data protection. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Our costs to comply with the GDPR as well any other similar laws and regulations that emerge may negatively impact our business.
