Overview
 
The Company was formed in August 2015 to expand upon the successful implementation of a solar hydrogen energy system used to completely power a residence or commercial property with clean energy so that it can run independent of the utility grid and also provide energy to the utility grid for monetary credits. This unique system uses renewal energy as its source for hydrogen production. We believe that it is a revolutionary green-energy concept that is safe, renewable, self-sustaining and cost effective. The hydrogen house concept began as a non-profit organization, The Hydrogen House Project, which was founded by Michael Strizki, our Chief Technology Officer. The organization successfully completed four hydrogen house projects, and we are now making the technology available to the general public.
Market Potential
 
According to the International Energy Agency, renewable energy will represent the largest single source of electricity growth over the next five years. During that time, the share of renewable energy in global power generation will rise to over 26% by 2020 from 22% in 2013. By 2020, the amount of global electricity generation coming from renewable energy will be higher than today’s combined electricity demand of China, India and Brazil. This rapid growth in the use of renewable energy is led by continued expansion in renewable energy technology, the need to lessen dependency on fossil fuel energy, grid-based vulnerabilities and the battle against global warming. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable sources of energy accounted for about 10% of total U.S. energy consumption and 15% of electricity generation in 2016. In 2016, approximately $44 billion was spent on renewable energy production in the U.S. alone.
 
As we are one of the first providers of a hydrogen energy system for residential housing, we are creating this new market within the renewable energy sector. As a result, there is no expectation or basis for any projections of the future of this market. Since the market did not exist previously, there can only be growth, not a decline, and we are, through the use of these statistics, showing that there is a significant market opportunity for hydrogen energy in the renewable energy sector. While the statistics show that there is expected to be a significant growth in renewable energy market, we cannot provide any assurances as to how much, if any, of this market, we will be able to capture.
 
Technology Overview
 
There are great benefits to hydrogen energy. The use of hydrogen as a fuel produces no carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Unlike fossil fuels, the only emissions from hydrogen fuel are chemically pure water and oxygen. Hydrogen can be extracted from water using renewable energy from the sun and unlike batteries, hydrogen energy can be stored indefinitely. There is no drilling, fracking or mining required to produce hydrogen energy. We believe it is safe and efficient, and the cleanest energy source on the planet.

In the past, there have been significant obstacles to commercializing hydrogen energy. The most significant being the need to reduce the cost of the production of hydrogen. No matter how productive an energy source may be, it will not be widely adopted if it is prohibitively expensive. As shown in the chart below, the cost of technology required to convert hydrogen gas to electricity has come down significantly over the last 10 years. As technology advances, the cost will continue to decline, making hydrogen energy more affordable.
 

Decline in Cost of Technology for a Standard System between 2006 and 2016 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Component | Cost in 2006 | | Cost in 2016 | | | Cost Savings 
Hydrogen Generator | $ | 25,000 | | $ | 9,000 | | $ | 16,000
Fuel Cell | $ | 22,000 | | $ | 7,000 | | $ | 15,000
Solar Panels (40 275 watt panels) | | $ 44,000 ($4.00 per watt) | | | $ 7,700 ($0.70 per watt) | | $ | 36,300
TOTAL: | $ | 91,000 | | $ | 23,700 | | $ | 67,300

 
In addition to the cost, another challenge involves obtaining zoning and permits to install the system. Each local and state municipality needs to approve the installation. There are no special licenses or permits that are required for a client to store hydrogen on their property. The only permits that are required in connection with a hydrogen energy system are the basic building permits that are required by each town/city/municipality or county in connection with home improvement projects. In connection with the permitting process, we must adhere to safety guidelines involving the safe installation of hydrogen, which are the (i) Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s standards for the storage or delivery of hydrogen gas, and (ii) National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s stationary and portable fuel cells systems codes and standards. We have obtained all zoning and licensing permits for its prior installations, and we believe that such existing documentation will be used for future approvals.
 
As well, for many people, hydrogen is a new form of energy that needs to be explained and documented, so we need to educate potential customers and overcome any resistance to adoption of new technology. There is also a misperception about hydrogen gas and its storage. There are no additional safety concerns when it comes to the storage of hydrogen gas, as it is similar to storing propane, another gas that is flammable but is in wide use and actively stored in tanks. As more installations are completed, we believe these challenges will become less restrictive.
 
The HC-1 System
 
We have succeeded in developing a hydrogen energy system designed to create electricity that is generated by renewable solar energy. We call the solar hydrogen energy system the HC-1. The HC-1 system functions as a self-sustaining renewable energy system. It can be configured as an off grid solution for all your electricity needs or it can be connected to the grid to generate energy credits. Its production of hydrogen is truly eco-friendly, as it is not produced by the use of fossil fuels. It is a system comprised of solar modules, inverters, batteries, a hydrogen generator, a fuel cell and a hydrogen storage tank.
 
When there is solar power, the solar modules produce renewable energy that is collected through a solar inverter, which charges a bank of batteries through a battery inverter. After the batteries are fully charged, the excess electricity is then combined with water through a hydrogen generator that extracts the hydrogen from the water in a gasified state, which is safely transferred to the hydrogen tank and stored for later use. If the tank is full, excess electricity is sent from the batteries through the battery inverter to the utility grid, which results in energy credits for the system owner.
 
The HC-1 system is connected to the residential or commercial property through the inverters. The electricity is always provided by the charged batteries. If there is no solar power to charge the batteries, the system keeps the batteries fully charged by using hydrogen stored in the tank, which processed through a fuel cell, creates the electricity. As the system is able to produce hydrogen, that keeps the hydrogen tank full, it provides a continuous supply of clean energy and sustainability that is independent from the grid.
 
Each HC-1 system is custom designed to accommodate the electrical loads for an end user. The system is completely scalable. Typically, one HC-1 standard system configuration with a solar modules and a large tank for hydrogen storage can provide 40 kWh per day, which is the average amount of electricity utilized by homes in the U.S. If the customer is connected to the electric grid, energy production that is converted to hydrogen in excess of the amount stored in the hydrogen tank is transferred to the local electric company, creating energy credits.

For an HC-1 system installation, the battery inverters and batteries are placed in the interior of the house or building. The hydrogen generator, fuel cell, electronics, pipes and tubing are kept in an outdoor enclosure near the house or building. The solar modules and solar inverters are outdoors and can be configured on the house or building or on land depending on available space. The hydrogen tank is typically underground but can be placed above ground, if necessary.

● | (1) 1,000 gallon hydrogen storage tank 

 
We do not manufacture any of the components of our HC-1 system. All components are purchased from various suppliers. We do not have any formal relationships with any suppliers as all of the components are readily available off-the-shelf from a number of various suppliers. As such, when we need to obtain components, we are able to source such components at that time and at the best available price.
 
Each project is customized to meet the particular needs of the client. Various factors, including the size of the residence, the amount of electricity needed to be generated and the amount and intensity of solar availability, all impact the price charged on a project. We anticipate that the anticipated range of prices for a hydrogen energy system is expected to be between $35,000 and $200,000.
 
Cost Savings
 
We believe that the HC-1 system has the potential to generate an excellent return on investment over time. However, we acknowledge that the initial cost of adopting a hydrogen energy system today is a significant hurdle for potential customers, as the short-term costs of electricity produced by fossil fuels is significantly cheaper to a customer than from our system, as we anticipate it will take approximately eight and one-half years before a customer has an overall net gain from our system.
 
For example, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the average cost in the New York/New Jersey area is 19.1 cents per kWh for the supply of electricity. An average customer in the State of New Jersey using 40 kWh per day spends approximately $300 per month on their electric bill, which includes the cost of the supply of electricity, the costs by the local utility company for the delivery of the electricity and taxes. It would cost the customer approximately $100,000 to buy our hydrogen energy system to provide that same amount of electricity. The owner received a 30% investment tax credit from the federal government for the installation of the renewable energy system. That tax credit results in a savings of $30,000, bringing the cost of the system down to $70,000.
 
The $300 monthly average electricity bill is eliminated, resulting in annual savings of $3,600, as the system produces all the electricity needed and also generates excess electricity that the system will generate about 18 SRECs per year. Those 18 SRECs are sold for approximately $4,500. As a result, the $70,000 HC-1 system will be repaid to the user in approximately 8.6 years, as the user is achieving annual savings of $8,100. Our calculation of cost savings assumes that the customer has purchased the system outright and not financed the purchase and does not include any maintenance costs that may be required in connection with the system. Further benefits include having a clean renewable energy source that protects our environment, lessening dependence on the aging grid and allowing for a backup power generation system if the grid malfunctions from a natural disaster or cyber-attack.
 
To date, there have been minimal maintenance costs for the hydrogen electric systems built, averaging less than $300 per year. In addition, there is a minimal amount of water required, no more than five gallons annually to keep the standard system replenished. The estimated life span of the system has not yet been determined at this time, as it is a relatively new application of the technology, but the first system was installed over 10 years ago and continues to properly operate.
 
The calculation of the number of SRECs generated each year is based upon historical results from the hydrogen electric system built to date. However, we have a very limited sample size, which may not be meaningful or accurate for all potential customers. As we are in our early stage of development with our systems, the potential cost savings may not be proven and we cannot provide any assurances to potential customers that they will achieve cost savings in the future, if at all. In addition, our calculations assume that the price of electricity remains relatively stable. If the price of electricity decreases, then it will take longer for a user to see savings from our system, and if the price of electricity increases, then a user should see savings in a shorter than anticipated timeframe.

Consulting and Installation Services
 
We will manage all projects directly and will be involved in all aspects of energy infrastructure build-out utilizing existing staff and subcontractors. We provide customers with an initial consultation free of charge, whereby we will review the customer’s location and utility bills to understand their historical energy consumption. We will then generate a proposal outline, indicating what type of system they will need, and what potential tax credits and energy credits they will be entitled to with our HC-1 system.
 
If the customer wishes to proceed, we are paid $5,000 to conduct a feasibility study, which involves:
 

● | Determining what government authorizations are required to proceed; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Determining what zoning regulations apply to the project site; 
● | Designing site plans and determining what site permits are required; 
● | Conducting an energy audit; 
● | Providing the preliminary system design and drawings; and 
● | Drafting of the project contract. 

 
Upon execution of the final contract, and payment of the initial fee, we initiate the system installation, which involves:
 

● | Assignment of the project manager; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Completed photovoltaic design with signed and sealed drawings; 
● | Completed electrical distribution and interconnection design with signed and sealed drawings; 
● | Execution and filing of all local construction permits and fees on behalf of the system end user; 
● | Completed public utility interconnection applications; 
● | Submission of all construction liability and professional liability insurance forms; 
● | Confirmation of safety compliance; 
● | Site preparation for implementation; 
● | System installation, completion of all cabling, system start-up, testing and commissioning; 
● | Site restoration; and 
● | Preparation of closeout documents with as-built drawings and photos. 

 
All project work is performed to specifications that meet local utility requirements as well as domestic and international building codes. Once the system is operational, we remotely receive data to monitor its performance and energy efficiency to confirm the system is functioning as expected. We will also provide any additional maintenance required at standard labor rates. We provide a standard one year warranty on our workmanship. Each of the components has a manufacturer’s warranty that is at least one year in duration. If components need to be replaced after the one year workmanship warranty, we will secure replacement components, under warranty if possible, and we will install at our standard labor rates.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Currently, our employees are licensed to install our HC-1 systems in the State of New Jersey and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We intend to aggressively grow our business, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. We intend to continue to acquire companies with licensed contractors in various states and regions, which will allow us to expand the territories in which we can build our systems. These acquired companies will also provide us with a consistent revenue stream, a customer base for marketing our HC-1 systems and technicians.
Pride Subsidiary
 
On January 31, 2017, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with The Pride Group (QLD) Pty Ltd., an Australian corporation (“Pride”), Turquino Equity LLC (“Turquino”) and Stephen Paul Mullane and Marie Louise Mullane as Trustees of the Mullane Family Trust (together with Turquino, the “Pride Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Pride from the Pride Shareholders in exchange for an aggregate of 3,800,000 shares of our common stock. Andrew Hidalgo and Matthew Hidalgo, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, are each a managing partner of Turquino.
 
Pride sells, designs, installs and maintains a variety of technology products in the security systems market, including commercial alarm systems, access control, video surveillance, CCTV (closed circuit television)/MATV (master antenna television) systems, biometric technology, audio/visual systems, nurse call systems and public announcement systems. Pride also provides programs for annual maintenance of its products and systems. The division generates approximately half of its revenue from government contracts and the other half from the commercial sector. Pride has recurring annual maintenance revenue of close to AUD $2 million. Pride is a certified security systems integrator for the Queensland Government and has various government contracts in place for installation, maintenance and project services. Pride also works with a number of general contractors as a subcontractor for security systems integration.

Pride Energy Systems is Pride’s clean energy division, which sells, designs, installs and maintains a variety of technology services in the clean energy market, including audits of energy consumption, review of energy and tax credits available, feasibility studies, solar/battery energy system design, zoning and permitting analysis, site design/preparation and restoration, system startup, testing and commissioning and maintenance. The division has just begun to bid for clean energy systems and is focused on the residential, commercial and government sectors. The division is able to utilize the many contacts established in the security systems division.
 
Australia presents a significant opportunity for us. According to The Clean Energy Australia Report of 2016, renewable energy provided 17.3 % of Australia’s electricity in 2016. This was up from the 14.6 % of electricity from renewable energy the year before. The combination of Australia’s dry climate and latitude is an ideal environment for solar energy production. One in five residential households are turning to solar energy for their electricity needs. Since the Australian outback and outlying islands near Australia having minimal and costly access to the grid, our renewable energy systems are an attractive option.
 
PVBJ Subsidiary
 
On February 1, 2018, we acquired PVBJ, Inc. (“PVBJ”) of Downingtown, Pennsylvania for $1 million of HCCC stock and $221,800 in cash. Established in 2008 and historically profitable, PVBJ is well recognized for the design, installation, maintenance and emergency service of environmental systems both in residential and commercial markets. PVBJ is now expanding into renewable energy systems. PVBJ has an extensive and notable customer base.
 
Completed Projects
 
As previously mentioned, the hydrogen house concept began as a non-profit organization that completed four hydrogen house projects. Outlined below are descriptions of two of these installations.
Strizki Property, Hopewell, NJ
 
This was the first solar hydrogen energy system installed in North America. Completed in 2006, the installation is comprised of land-based and roof-based solar modules, 10 above ground tanks each holding 1,000 gallons of gasified hydrogen, six inverters, 48 6v batteries, a hydrogen generator and a fuel cell. At the time, the cost of this system was $185,000 due to the additional solar modules, storage tanks, inverters and batteries, which have all since, come down in price. This 2,800 square foot home can operate completely off the grid but is connected to the grid in order to generate energy credits. The home produces approximately $8,000 in SRECs per year.
De Tiberge Property, Pennington, NJ
 
This project was completed in 2015 and was comprised of land-based solar modules, one underground tank that holds 1,000 gallons of gasified hydrogen, four solar inverters, four battery inverters, 24 6v batteries, a hydrogen generator and a fuel cell. The sale price for the system was $185,000. The higher sales price reflects a larger solar module installation and multiple inverters. The system was purchased outright by the owner and included a 30% investment tax credit from the federal government. The dwelling is a 2,300 square foot home that had an average monthly electricity bill of $680. With the installation of the solar hydrogen energy system, the property generates approximately $9,000 in SRECs per year and saving approximately $8,000 per year as there is no electricity bill.
Competition
 
Given the increasing focus on renewable energy to offset the environmental problems caused by fossil fuels, the renewable energy industry is highly competitive, and rapidly evolving. Our major competitors include leading global companies, and other regional and local energy providers.
 
In the markets where we plan to conduct business, we will compete with many energy producers including electric utilities and large independent power producers. There is also competition from fossil fuel sources such as natural gas and coal, and other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. The competition depends on the resources available within the specific markets. However, we believe that our unique system allows us to compete favorably with traditional utilities and other renewable energy systems in the regions we service.

-


Although the cost to produce clean, reliable, renewable energy is becoming more competitive with traditional fossil fuel sources, it generally remains more expensive to produce, and the reliability of its supply is less consistent than traditional fossil fuel. Deregulation and consumer preference are becoming important factors in increasing the development of renewable energy projects.
 
However, as a newly formed company, substantially all of our competitors have advantages over us in terms of greater operational, financial, technical, management or other resources in particular markets or in general. While hydrogen energy has certain advantages when compared to other power generating technologies, it is one of the newer and less established methods of renewable energy and therefore currently has less market acceptance.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
We are subject to laws and regulations affecting our operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities which include, but are not limited to, the areas of zoning, permitting, labor, advertising, consumer protection, real estate, billing, quality of services, intellectual property and ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, and health and safety. In the U.S., our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We expend resources to maintain compliance with OSHA requirements and industry best practices.
Regulatory Matters
 
If a customer wishes to connect our system to the electrical grid in order to generate renewable energy credits, the customer needs to obtain interconnection agreements from the applicable local primary electricity utility. Prior to an installation of the HC-1 system, on behalf of the customer, we will submit an interconnection application with the local public utility company to become a certified renewable energy generator. Approval of the application is based on a balance of historical consumption and the amount of renewable energy to be produced. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection agreements are signed. In our experience, there has not been any cost involved in obtaining an interconnection agreement, but as the requirements are determined on a local basis, it may be possible that some nominal costs are involved in connection with the process.
Government Incentives
 
We intend to focus on states or countries whose government supports a regulatory standard requiring its utility companies to increase their production of energy from renewable energy sources. These governments have established various incentives and financial mechanisms to accelerate and promote the use of renewable energy sources. Currently, many states comply with regulatory standards including New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, West Virginia, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois as well as the District of Columbia. In addition, countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Belgium and Chile have adopted regulatory standards. The list is expanding each year.
 
If the customer obtains an interconnection agreement from the applicable local primary electricity utility, once the HC-1 system is operational, the HC-1 system end user can eliminate their electric bill and, if in a permissible state, can begin generating SRECs. In certain states, an end user receives one SREC for each 1,000 kWh produced through renewal energy. The customer sells these SRECs to a broker who in turn sells the credits to a utility company so that the utility company can demonstrate their compliance with the regulatory obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The price per SREC can vary depending on supply and demand, but on average, SRECs sells for $250. Many other states, which may not offer an SREC program, as well as the Federal government, do offer other cash and tax incentives for renewable energy systems.
 
Employees
 
As of March 30, 2018, we had 50 full time employees, of which 30 work for Pride, 15 for PVBJ, and five at corporate. We plan to hire employees on an as-needed basis. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.

H/CELL ENERGY CORPORATION
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016
 

1. | ORGANIZATION AND LINE OF BUSINESS 
---+--------------------------------------

 
H/Cell Energy Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 17, 2015. The Company, based in Flemington, N.J., is a company whose principal operations consist of designing and installing hydrogen energy systems. Effective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired The Pride Group (QLD) Pty Ltd, an Australian company (“Pride”) (see Note 10). Founded in 1997, Pride is a provider of security systems integration for a variety of customers in the government and commercial sector and has launched a new clean energy systems division to focus on the high growth renewable energy market in Asia-Pacific. The new clean energy division has not generated any revenue but has begun to bid work and expects to have projects completed in 2018.


The Company has developed a hydrogen energy system for residential and commercial use designed to create electricity. This unique system uses renewable energy as its source for hydrogen production. It functions as a self-sustaining clean energy system. It can be configured as an off grid solution for all electricity needs or it can be connected to the grid to generate energy credits. Its production of hydrogen is truly eco-friendly, as it is not produced by the use of fossil fuels. It is a revolutionary green-energy concept that is safe, renewable, self-sustaining and cost effective.
 

2. | SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
---+-----------------------------------------------

Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Accounts and Retainage Receivable
 
Accounts receivable are recorded when invoices are issued and are presented in the balance sheet net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the Company’s historical losses, the existing economic conditions in the construction industry, and the financial stability of its customers. Accounts are written off as uncollectible after collection efforts have failed. In addition, the Company does not generally charge interest on past-due accounts or require collateral. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts required.
 
Many of the contracts under which the Company performs work contain retainage provisions. Retainage refers to that portion of billings made by the Company but held for payment by the customer pending satisfactory completion of the project. Unless reserved, the Company assumes that all amounts retained by customers under such provisions are fully collectible. Retainage on active contracts is classified as a current asset regardless of the term of the contract and is generally collected within one year of the completion of a contract.


Property and Equipment, and Depreciation
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is generally provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement.
 
Repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the lives of the property and equipment are charged to expense as incurred.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016
 
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
 
Comprehensive income (loss) consists of two components, net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments.
Foreign Currency Translation
 
The Company translates its foreign subsidiary’s assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at current rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date and income and expense items at the average exchange rate for the reporting period. Translation adjustments resulting from exchange rate fluctuations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company records gains and losses from changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than each reporting location’s functional currency in net income (loss) for each period.
Revenue Recognition
 
Revenues and related costs on construction contracts are recognized using the “percentage of completion method” of accounting in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605-35, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts. Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Costs include direct material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs. All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred.
 
Revenues and expenses related to service and maintenance contracts are booked when costs are incurred and billed when the job is complete.
 
Revisions in cost and profit estimates during the course of the contract are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts, which require the revision, become known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions, and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in bank and money market funds as well as other highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. The Company had no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 or 2016. At times during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, balances exceeded the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000.
Research and Development Costs
 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs consist primarily of consulting fees, salaries and direct payroll related costs.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company recognizes expense for its stock-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards at the time they are granted. We estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, expected term, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends and expected forfeiture rates. The forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation information, adjusted for anticipated changes in expected exercise and employment termination behavior. Our outstanding awards do not contain market or performance conditions.

Income Taxes
 
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carryforwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
The determination of the Company’s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense.
 
The Company recognizes and measures its unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with ASC 740. Under that guidance, management assesses the likelihood that tax positions will be sustained upon examination based on the facts, circumstances and information, including the technical merits of those positions, available at the end of each period. The measurement of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted when new information is available, or when an event occurs that requires a change.
 
The Company did not identify any material uncertain tax positions. The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits.
 
The federal income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS, generally for the three years after they are filed. The Company’s 2016 and 2015 income tax returns are still open for examination by the taxing authorities.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and short-term borrowings, as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.
Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share 
 
The Company computes basic net income (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) per share available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and excludes the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities into common stock using the “treasury stock” and/or “if converted” methods as applicable. The computation of diluted loss per share excludes dilutive securities for the year ended December 31, 2016 because its inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Potentially-dilutive securities excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2016 are as follows:

Totals | | 1,000,000


3. | RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
---+-------------------------------

 
The Company’s current office space consists of approximately 800 square feet, which is donated to it from one of its executive officers. There is no lease agreement and the Company pays no rent.
 
Effective February 4, 2016, the Company sold 526,316 shares of common stock to Reza Enterprises, Inc., an entity beneficially owned by Rezaul Karim. In connection with, and as a condition of closing, the Company agreed to appoint Rezaul Karim to its board of directors. Rezaul Karim resigned from the board of directors effective April 1, 2017. On April 1, 2017, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Rezaul Karim for a period of one year. As such his function will be to promote our products and services. In April 2017, Rezaul Karim exercised 100,000 options.
 
In June 2016, the Company entered into a contract with Rezaul Karim, then one of its directors, for the installation of an HC-1 system, which has been modified from time to time to increase the scope of the project. The system installation was approximately 76% complete as of December 31, 2017 and generated $85,919 of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company subcontracted the installation of the system to Renewable Energy Holdings LLC (“REH”), a company owned by Mike Strizki, one of the Company’s executive officers. James Strizki, one of the Company’s executive officers and former director, is vice president of operations at REH. Costs incurred were $87,649 for REH for the year ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, the job was 21% complete and generated $12,374 of revenue and costs incurred were $12,127.
 
The Company has entered into agreements to indemnify its directors and executive officers, in addition to the indemnification provided for in the Company’s articles of incorporation and bylaws. These agreements, among other things, provide for indemnification of the Company’s directors and executive officers for certain expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in the right of the Company, arising out of such person’s services as a director or executive officer of the Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any other company or enterprise to which the person provided services at the Company’s request. The Company believes that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and executive officers.
 
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the balances due to Turquino Equity LLC, a significant shareholder owned by Andrew and Matthew Hidalgo, who are the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively, amounted to approximately $31,000 and $52,000, respectively. These balances represent expenses for management services. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, management fees expensed totaled approximately $184,000 and $158,000, respectively.
 

4. | SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 
---+----------------------------------------------

 
Cash is maintained at an authorized deposit-taking institution (bank) incorporated in both the United States and Australia and is insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Australian Securities & Investments Commission up to $250,000 and approximately $186,000 USD in total, respectively.
 
Credit risk for trade accounts is concentrated as well because substantially all of the balances are receivable from entities located within certain geographic regions. To reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions, but does not generally require collateral. In addition, at December 31, 2017, approximately 36% of the Company’s accounts receivable was due from three unrelated customers, 14%, 12% and 10%, respectively; and, at December 31, 2016, approximately 26% was due from one customer.

9. | CONTRACT BACKLOG
---+-----------------

 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a contract backlog approximating $1,091,816, with anticipated direct costs to completion approximating $808,098. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a contract backlog approximating $2,184,117 with anticipated direct costs to completion approximating $1,777,140.
 

10. | ACQUISITION UNDER COMMON CONTROL 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On January 31, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) by and among the Company, The Pride Group (QLD) Pty Ltd., an Australian corporation (“Pride”), Turquino Equity LLC (“Turquino”) and Stephen Paul Mullane and Marie Louise Mullane as Trustees of the Mullane Family Trust (the “Mullane Trust” and together with Turquino, the “Pride Shareholders”). Andrew Hidalgo and Matthew Hidalgo, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, are each a managing partner of Turquino.
 
Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Pride from the Pride Shareholders in exchange for an aggregate of 3,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Acquisition Shares”). As a result, the combination of the Company and Pride pursuant to the Exchange Agreement is considered a business combination of companies under common control and was accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests. The accompanying financial statements have been retrospectively restated as a result of an acquisition of another company under common control with the Company, which was completed in January 2017.



11. | STOCK OPTIONS AWARDS AND GRANTS 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A summary of the stock option activity and related information for the 2016 Incentive Stock Option Plan from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2017 is as follows:
 


 | Shares | | | Weighted- Average Exercise Price | | | Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term | Aggregate Intrinsic Value 
-------------------------------------+--------+-----------+---+--------------------------------------+---+------+-------------------------------------------------+------------------------------
Outstanding at December 31, 2015 | | - | | | | | | | | | 
Grants | | 1,000,000 | | | $ | 0.01 | | 5.00 | $ | 387,450 | 
Exercised | | - | | | | | | | | | 
Canceled | | - | | | | | | | | | 
Outstanding at December 31, 2016 | | 1,000,000 | | | $ | 0.01 | | 3.19 | $ | 387,450 | 
Grants | | 150,000 | | | | 1.83 | | 4.35 | | 165,477 | 
Exercised | | (100,000 | ) | | | 0.01 | | - | | (38,745 | )
Canceled | | - | | | | | | | | | 
Outstanding at December 31, 2017 | | 1,050,000 | | | $ | 0.27 | | 3.35 | | 514,182 | 
Exercisable at December 31, 2017 | | - | | | $ | - | | - | $ | - | 



The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on options with an exercise price less than the Company’s weighted average grant date stock price of $0.473 per share which would have been received by the option holders had those option holders exercised their options as of that date. It also includes options granted at exercise prices of $2.00 and $1.50, which were equal to the closing sales price of the Corporation’s common stock on the dates of grant.


Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. The fair value of stock-based payment awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option model with a volatility figure derived from an index of historical stock prices of comparable entities until sufficient data exists to estimate the volatility using the Company’s own historical stock prices. Management determined this assumption to be a more accurate indicator of value.

The Company accounts for the expected life of options based on the contractual life of options for non-employees. For incentive options granted to employees, the Company accounts for the expected life in accordance with the “simplified” method, which is used for “plain-vanilla” options, as defined in the accounting standards codification. The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining life consistent with the expected term of the options.  The fair value of stock-based payment awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company granted an aggregate of 150,000 options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock in connection with the services rendered at the exercise price of $2.00 and $1.50 per share for a term of five years, vesting at various dates, and have approximate fair value of $156,477. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company granted an aggregate of 1,000,000 options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock in connection with the services rendered at the exercise price of $0.01 per share for a term of five years, vesting immediately, and have approximate fair value of $387,450. These options vesting dates were then amended to various dates in the future and approved by the Board.


The following table presents information related to stock options at December 31, 2017:

13. | RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
----+-------------------------------------

 
In May 2014, the FASB issued accounting standard update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”). The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under previous guidance. This may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB approved the proposal to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 standard by one year. Early adoption was permitted after December 15, 2016, and the standard became effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. In 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify the implementation guidance for principal versus agent considerations (ASU No. 2016-08), accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations (ASU No. 2016-10), narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients (ASU No. 2016-12) and technical corrections and improvements to ASU 2014-09 (ASU No. 2016-20) in its new revenue standard. The Company has performed a review of the requirements of the new revenue standard and is monitoring the activity of the FASB and the transition resource group as it relates to specific interpretive guidance. The Company reviewed customer contracts, applied the five-step model of the new standard to its contracts, and compared the results to its current accounting practices. The Company is currently in the process of drafting disclosures required by the new standard. Based on its analysis to date, the Company does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial statements, but will potentially require the Company to expand its disclosures related to contracts with customers.
 
In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. As a result of adoption, there was no material effect on the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
During January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments — Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted with the exception of certain provisions related to the presentation of other comprehensive income. The Company is still analyzing the adoption of ASU 2016-01, but it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.


During February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (“ASU 2016-02”). The standard requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The update also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to an insignificant number of leases that the Company has entered into.
 
In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (“ASU 2016-15”). ASU 2016-15 clarifies the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 to have a material impact on its financial statements.

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (“ASU 2017-09”) to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under this new guidance, modification accounting is required if the fair value, vesting conditions, or classification of the award changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within each annual reporting period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the financial statements.
 
Management does not believe there would have been a material effect on the accompanying financial statements had any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards been adopted in the current period.
 

14. | NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE 
----+--------------------------------

 
The following table sets forth the information needed to compute basic and diluted earnings per share:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, 2017 | | Year Ended December 31, 2016 | 
-------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------+-----------------------------------+--
Net income (loss) | $ | 8,897 | | $ | (706,727 | )
Weighted average common shares outstanding | | 6,703,223 | | | 2,853,785 | 
Dilutive securities | | | | | | 
Options | | 996,521 | | | 0 | 
Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding | | 7,699,743 | | | 2,853,785 | 
Basic net income (loss) per share | $ | 0.00 | | | (0.25 | )
Diluted net income (loss) per share | $ | 0.00 | | | (0.25 | )



For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, certain potential shares of common stock have been excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share because of a net loss, and therefore, the effect on diluted income per share would have been anti-dilutive. 



15. | INCOME TAXES

The components of income tax expense (benefit) are as follows (in thousands):

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had deferred tax assets of $235,000 and $41,000, respectively, against which a valuation allowance of $191,000 and $41,000, respectively, had been recorded. The change in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2017 was an increase of $150,000. The increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2017 was mainly attributable to increases in U.S. net operating
 
losses and share-based compensation, which resulted in an increase in our deferred tax assets. We established valuation allowances equal to the full amount of our U.S. deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty of the realization of these deferred tax assets in future periods. We periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover the deferred tax assets. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income.
 
Significant components of our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows ($ in thousands): 
 

 | December 31, | 
--------------------------------------------+------------------+-----
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
Deferred tax assets: | | | | | | | 
Net operating loss carryforwards – U.S. | $ | 68 | | | | 41 | 
Share-based compensation | | 123 | | | | - | 
Accrued liabilities | | 44 | | | | - | 
Gross deferred tax assets | | 235 | | | | 41 | 
Valuation allowance | | (191 | ) | | | (41 | )
Net deferred tax assets | $ | 44 | | | $ | - | 

 
A reconciliation between taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective tax rate is as follows:



 | For the Year Ended | 
-------------------------------------------+------------------------+-------
 | December 31, | 
 | 2017 | | | 2016
U.S. federal statutory tax rate | | 34.0 | % | | 34.0 | %
State income taxes, net of federal benefit | | (67.2 | ) | | 5.9 | 
U.S. vs. foreign tax rate differential | | (20.7 | ) | | - | 
Impact of tax law change | | 140.5 | | | - | 
Deferred tax adjustments | | (205.7 | ) | | - | 
Deemed repatriation | | 34.7 | | | - | 
Other | | (8.1 | ) | | - | 
Change in valuation allowance | | 178.4 | | | (39.9 | )
Effective tax rate | | 85.9 | % | | - | %



We had approximately $235,000 and $97,000 of gross net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards (U.S. federal and state) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which begin to expire after 2036 through 2037. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, and similar state regulations, contain provisions that may limit the NOL carryforwards available to be used to offset income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events, including changes in the ownership interests of significant stockholders. In the event of a cumulative change in ownership in excess of 50% over a three-year period, the amount of the NOL carryforwards that the Company may utilize in any one year may be limited.
 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted in December 2017. Among other things, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, eliminates the alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) for corporations, and creates a one-time deemed repatriation of profits earned outside of the U.S. The reduction of the corporate tax rate resulted in a write-down of our gross deferred tax assets of approximately $88,000, and a corresponding write-down of the valuation allowance. The one-time deemed repatriation of profits by our Australian subsidiary resulted in a decrease in our NOL of approximately $64,000.



16. | SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
----+------------------

 
In accordance with FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events, the Company has evaluated subsequent events through April 2, 2018, the date on which these financial statements were available to be issued.


On January 2, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with two of its directors that are accredited investors; Andrew Hidalgo and Michael Doyle, pursuant to which it sold an aggregate principal amount of $400,000 in 12% Convertible debentures, convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share at a conversion price of $0.75 per share. The debentures, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, become due and payable on January 2, 2020.
 
On February 1, 2018, the Company acquired PVBJ for $1 million of the Company’s common stock and $221,800 in cash. Established in 2008 and historically profitable, PVBJ is well recognized for the design, installation, maintenance and emergency service of environmental systems both in residential and commercial markets. PVBJ is now expanding into renewable energy systems.
