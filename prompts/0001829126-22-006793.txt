Competition and Market Conditions
 
We will face substantial competition in our efforts to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until the economy recovers. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect there to be enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand and/or increased raw material costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control.
Regulation
 
As of the date of this Report, we are required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).
 
Depending on the direction management decides to take and a business or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may become subject to other laws or regulations that require us to make material expenditures on compliance including the increasing state-level regulation of privacy. Any such requirements could require us to divert significant human and capital resources on compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this Report, we do not have employees. However, an entity controlled by our Chief Executive Officer provides part-time consulting services to us without compensation.
