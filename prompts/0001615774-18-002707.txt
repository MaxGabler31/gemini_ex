DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS
 
Data Storage Corporation (“DSC” or the “Company”) focuses on business continuity solutions, cloud and compliance. DSC provides a Hybrid Cloud, Infrastructure as a Service, Disaster Recovery as a Service and Email Archival and Compliance Solutions.
 
BUSINESS CONTINUITY SOLUTIONS: Disaster Recovery as a Service
 
DSC offers a fully automated service designed to reduce the overall costs associated with backup and recovery of application and file servers that enables organizations to centralize and streamline their data protection process. Business critical data can be backed up any time while servers are up and running.
 
The essence of data backup is the scheduled movement of “point-in-time” snapshots of data across a network to a remote location. DSC’s disk-to-disk backup and recovery solution is reliable and easy to use. As part of this service, DSC offers Continuous Data Protection (“CDP”), delta block processing, data de-duplication and large volume protection.
 
Significant advantages over traditional backup software:
 

● | Immediate off-site backup 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced backup windows 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Elimination of tape management issues 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Minimized costs associated with distributed backups 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Elimination of human intervention 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Encryption of all backed up data 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Optimized bandwidth de-duplication and compression 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Archiving – Lifecycle Management
 
Backup data must be managed throughout its life cycle to provide the best data protection, meet compliance regulations and to improve recovery time objectives (“RTO”). DSC offers policy-based file archiving and manages archiving and restoration of data from backup sessions, reducing the cost of inactive files on-line. DSC creates restorable point in time copies of backup sets for historical reference to meet compliance objectives and creates Certificates of Destruction. All of an enterprise’s data can be placed into one of two categories; Critical information which is needed for day-to-day operations and resides in the system’s primary storage for fast access; Important information is the historical, legal and regulatory information that can safely be archived to secondary storage, lower cost disk or tapes stored offsite.
Continuous Data Protection (“CDP”)
 
What if a database is corrupted in the middle of the workday? As data continually mounts in today’s fast paced business environment, organizations need to protect their systems on an ongoing basis, or risk losing mission critical data, information, and transactions, as well as associated business revenue. CDP solutions employ sophisticated I/O, CPU, and network throttling to achieve efficiency and reliability. Moreover, to protect against connectivity failures and interruptions, CDP features an auto resume mechanism that sustains replication and adapts according to the environment to achieve optimal and predictable performance.
 
Our technology will identify and propagate only that sector of data to the disaster recovery site, effectively reducing bandwidth and storage consumption. CDP also employs data compression and encryption to maximize network bandwidth utilization and ensure end- to-end security between the primary and DR site.

For those companies that have recovery time objectives of 1 hour or less, DSC’s HA solution meets the high availability demands of their business. DSC’s HA solution is a subscription-based high availability offering. For a monthly subscription fee and long-term contract, DSC creates and maintains a mirror of its clients’ mission critical systems and data at a secure off-site data center ensuring their business is “switch ready.” During either planned or unplanned downtime, DSC’s HA solution ensures the business will continue to operate, by providing an essential Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), switchable “mirror” of a client’s data and applications.
 
In the event of an outage, the DSC system becomes the client’s production system. When the client’s production system is again operational, the DSC server updates the client’s system with any new data. When downtime is planned, the customer can switch to the DSC server and run its production applications.
