Energy | 18 | % | | 16 | % | 21 | % | | 15 | % | 6 | % | 17 | %

Spin-off of Energy Businesses
On December 7, 2017, we announced that we plan to spin-off, on a tax-free basis, our upstream energy businesses within our Energy segment, collectively, the “Wellsite” business, into a standalone, publicly traded company, to be named at a later date. 
Upon completion of the spin-off, Wellsite will be a leading provider of a full range of oil and gas production technologies and solutions, wellsite productivity software and Industrial Internet ("IIoT") solutions. Wellsite will also be the industry leader in the development and production of polycrystalline diamond cutters used for oil and gas exploration. Wellsite serves many of the most attractive segments in the oil and gas industry with its portfolio of leading brands including Norris, Harbison-Fischer, Accelerated, PCS Ferguson, Norriseal-Wellmark, Spirit, Quartzdyne, Windrock and USS. We expect to complete the spin-off of the Wellsite businesses in May of 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions. Upon separation, the historical results of Wellsite will be presented as discontinued operations as it represents a strategic shift in operations with a material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
3

As part of the spin-off, Wellsite is expected to raise $700 million to $800 million of new debt, the proceeds of which will be paid to Dover in the form of a dividend. We anticipate returning the proceeds to shareholders as the primary source of funding for $1 billion of share repurchases to be completed by the end of 2018.
Management Philosophy 
Our businesses are committed to operational excellence and to being market leaders as measured by market share, customer satisfaction, growth, profitability and return on invested capital. Our operating structure of four business segments allows for focused acquisition activity, accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies, including global sourcing and supply chain integration, shared services and manufacturing and advances the development of our executive talent. Our segment and executive management set strategic direction, initiatives and goals and provide oversight for our operating companies and also allocate and manage capital, are responsible for major acquisitions and provide other services. We foster an operating culture with high ethical standards, trust, respect and open communication, designed to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness. 
In addition, we are committed to creating value for our customers, employees and shareholders through sustainable business practices that protect the environment and the development of products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals. We have accelerated our efforts and processes around innovation, focusing on technologies which create tangible value for our customers. Most notably, we believe that product innovations like the LaRio single-pass digital textile printer within our Engineered Systems segment, EvoClean laundry system within our Fluids segment, AdvansorFlex CO2 refrigeration system and Vista Elite Cooler Door within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment and Spirit Genesis Pump Off Controller within our Energy segment help to make a positive difference for the environment while providing value to shareholders and customers. 
Our operating companies are increasing their focus on efficient energy usage, greenhouse gas reduction and waste management as they strive to meet the global environmental needs of today and tomorrow. 
Company Goals
We are committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives. First, we are committed to achieving annual organic sales growth of 3% to 5% over a long-term business cycle, absent adverse economic conditions, complemented by acquisition growth. Second, we continue to focus on segment margin expansion through productivity initiatives, including supply chain activities, targeted, thoughtful restructuring activities, strategic pricing and portfolio shaping. Third, we are committed to generating adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of sales of approximately 10% through strong earnings performance, productivity improvements and active working capital management. We support these goals through (1) alignment of management compensation with financial objectives, (2) well-defined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes and (3) talent development programs. 
Business Strategy 
To achieve our goals, we are focused on execution of the following three key business strategies: 
Positioning ourselves for growth 
We have aligned our business segments to focus on the needs of customers in key end markets that are well-positioned for future growth. We capitalize on our expertise while maintaining an intense focus on our customers and their needs. We maintain and emphasize our entrepreneurial culture and continuously innovate to address our customers’ needs to help them win in the markets they serve. 
In particular, our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on trends in the areas of global energy demand, continuous productivity improvement, sustainability, energy efficiency, consumer product safety and growth of consumerism in emerging economies. Our Engineered Systems segment combines its engineering technology and capabilities, unique product advantages and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including conversion to digital textile printing, productivity solutions, sustainability, consumer product safety and growth in emerging economies. The Fluids segment is focused on accelerated growth within the chemical/plastics, retail fueling, fluid transfer, industrial and hygienic markets as well as globalizing brands across geographies while expanding sales channels and engineering support. In particular, we are pursuing further growth 
4

in the retail fueling, hygienic and pharma and polymers/plastics markets. Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment is responding to our customers’ energy efficiency and sustainability concerns and unique merchandising requirements with innovative new products. Our Energy segment is focusing on expansion in high growth basins and technologies, accelerating capabilities to drive international growth and increasing investment in automation to drive customer productivity and cash flow. 
Capturing the benefits of common ownership 
We are committed to operational excellence and capturing the benefits of common ownership. Through formalized company sponsored programs and an embedded culture of continuous improvement, we focus on adjusted free cash flow generation, productivity to support ongoing investment in product innovation and customer expansion activities, the continuous evaluation of operating efficiencies and the continued consolidation of back office support. Through these programs we have implemented various productivity initiatives, such as supply chain management and lean manufacturing, to maximize our efficiency as well as workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees. We foster the sharing of best practices throughout the organization. To ensure success, our businesses place strong emphasis on continual quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets. Further, we continue to make significant investments in talent development, recognizing that the growth and development of our employees are essential for our continued success. 
Additionally in 2016, we began to invest in our Dover Business Services ("DBS") shared service centers which brings significant value to Dover by providing important transactional and value added services to our operating companies in the areas of finance, information technology and human resources. Our model allows us to leverage scale across Dover, increase process efficiencies through technology and specialization and reduce risk through centralized controls. Ultimately, our mission is to serve our operating companies by freeing resources normally dedicated to transactional services to allow those resources to focus on customers, markets and product excellence.
Disciplined capital allocation 
Our businesses generate annual adjusted free cash flow of approximately 10% of revenue. We are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize returns on investment. To do this, we grow and support our existing businesses with average annual investment in capital spending of approximately 2% to 2.5% of revenue with a focus on internal projects to expand markets, develop products and boost productivity. Businesses in our portfolio are continually evaluated for strategic fit and our acquisitions are targeted in our key growth markets which include printing and identification, refrigeration and food equipment, pumps, fueling and transport, hygienic and pharma and select energy markets. We consistently return cash to shareholders by paying dividends, which have increased annually over each of the last 62 years. We will also plan to complete $1 billion of share repurchases by the end of 2018 as part of our capital allocation strategy. 
Portfolio Development 
Acquisitions
Our acquisition program has two key elements. First, we seek to acquire value creating add-on businesses that enhance our existing businesses either through their global reach and customers, or by broadening their product mix. Second, in the right circumstances, we will strategically pursue larger, stand-alone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces. With all our acquisitions, we seek businesses that have an accretive margin and a strong organic growth profile, and also offer significant synergy opportunities.
5

Over the past three years (2015 through 2017), we have spent over $2.2 billion to purchase 13 businesses. During 2017, we acquired three businesses for an aggregate consideration of $43.1 million, net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration. These businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within the Engineered Systems and Fluids segments. During 2016, we acquired six businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $1.6 billion, net of cash acquired. These businesses include Tokheim Group S.A.S., Fairbanks Environmental LTD, ProGauge and Wayne Fueling Systems Ltd. to expand our Fluids segment's retail fueling portfolio and Alliance Wireless Technologies, Inc. and Ravaglioli S.p.A. Group to complement the Industrials platform within our Engineered Systems segment. During 2015, we acquired four businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $567.8 million, net of cash acquired. These businesses include Gala Industries and Reduction Engineering Scheer, to expand our Fluids segment's plastics and polymers product and integrated systems portfolio. In addition, in 2015, we acquired JK Group, a global manufacturer and provider of innovative digital inks for the textile printing market, to complement the Printing & Identification platform within our Engineered Systems segment. For more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years, see Note 3 — Acquisitions in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
Our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses which expand the scope of our offering and make us a more important supplier to our customers. While we expect to generate annual organic growth of 3% to 5% over a long-term business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions, sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year. Our success is also dependent on the ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses within our existing structure. To track post-merger integration and accountability, we utilize an internal scorecard and defined processes to help ensure expected synergies are realized and value is created.
Dispositions
Occasionally, we may also make an opportunistic sale of one of our businesses based on specific market conditions or for strategic considerations, which include an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets and focus on our higher margin growth spaces. During the past three years (2015 through 2017) we have sold seven businesses for aggregate consideration of $1.3 billion. 
During 2017, we completed the sale of Performance Motorsports International and the consumer and industrial winch business of Warn Industries, within the Engineered Systems segment, as well as other smaller divestitures. These disposals did not represent strategic shifts in operations and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations. 
During 2016, we completed the sale of Texas Hydraulics and Tipper Tie, within the Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments, respectively. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2015 we completed the divestiture of the walk-in cooler business of Hillphoenix within the Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment. These disposals did not represent strategic shifts in operations and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations. 
During 2015, we completed the sale of Datamax O'Neil and Sargent Aerospace. The financial position and results of operations for the 2015 divestitures have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. For more details, see Note 4 — Disposed and Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
Business Segments 
As noted previously, we currently operate through four business segments that are aligned with the key end markets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments: Engineered Systems, Fluids, Refrigeration & Food Equipment and Energy. For financial information about our segments and geographic areas, see Note 17 — Segment Information in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Our Energy segment’s sales are made directly to customers and through various distribution channels. We manufacture our products primarily in North America and our sales are concentrated in North America with an increasing level of international sales directed primarily to Europe, Australia and Asia.
Raw Materials 
We use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished components, which are generally available from a number of sources. As a result, shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had, and are not likely to have, a material impact on operating profits. While the required raw materials are generally available, commodity pricing can be volatile, particularly for various grades of steel, copper, aluminum and select other commodities. Although cost increases in commodities may be recovered through increased prices to customers, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. We attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global supply chain activities. 
8

Research and Development 
Our businesses invest to develop innovative products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs, expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally, maintain or extend competitive advantages, improve product reliability and reduce production costs. During 2017, we spent $125.0 million for research and development, including qualified engineering costs. In 2016 and 2015, research and development spending totaled $104.5 million and $115.0 million, respectively. 
Our Engineered Systems segment expends significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high. Our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation, performance improvement and reduced costs. The result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period. 
Our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives. These businesses concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes. Most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the Engineered Systems segment. 
Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets 
Our businesses own many patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over a number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various times over a number of years. A large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents, unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate. In addition, a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships. While our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success, the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships, or any group of related rights or relationships, is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis. We believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements, new product development and improved manufacturing techniques, as well as strong sales, marketing and service efforts, are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve.
Customers 
We serve thousands of customers, none of which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2017. Given our diversity of served markets, customer concentrations are not significant. Businesses supplying the waste and recycling, agricultural, defense, energy, automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries. This also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation and chemical industries. In the other markets served, there is usually a much lower concentration of customers, particularly where our companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of end-use applications. 
Seasonality 
In general, our businesses, while not strongly seasonal, tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, particularly those serving the transportation, construction, waste and recycling, petroleum, commercial refrigeration and food service markets. Our businesses serving the retail fueling market tend to increase sequentially through the year based on the historical purchasing patterns of their customers. Our businesses serving the major equipment markets, such as power generation, chemical and processing industries, have longer lead times geared to seasonal, commercial, or consumer demands and customers in these markets tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends that tend to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns. 
Backlog
Backlog is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have long-term contracts, primarily for the markets within our Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. Our total backlog relating to our continuing operations as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.
9

Competition
Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served. In general, most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies, and the key competitive factors are customer service, product quality, price and innovation. However, as we become increasingly global, we are exposed to more competition. A summary of our key competitors by end market within each of our segments follows:

Environmental Matters 
Sustainability
In response to our concerns around global sustainability, in 2010, we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of our greenhouse gas emissions. Since then, we have evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities, as well as developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes goals, objectives and related projects for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. To further promote our sustainability efforts, we have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20% from 2010 to 2020. We are near our goal for reducing overall energy intensity and have surpassed our goal for reducing greenhouse gas intensity. We will continue to work proactively to reduce energy usage and carbon emissions amidst acquisition and business growth. We have also participated as a voluntary respondent in the Carbon Disclosure Project since 2010 and have maintained our scoring range since we began reporting. 
All of our segments assess the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the opportunities associated with the use of their products and services by customers. In some instances, our businesses may be able to help customers reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Increased demand for energy-efficient products based on a variety of drivers could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses. 
Other Matters
Our operations are governed by a variety of international, national, state and local environmental laws. We are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws. In a few instances, particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances. Where necessary, these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance. 
There have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment. We are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehouse/distribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses. We anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short- to medium-term. We expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in "pass through" costs from energy suppliers, suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations. 
Employees
We had approximately 29,000 employees as of December 31, 2017. 
Other Information 
We make available through the "Investor Information" link on our website, www.dovercorporation.com, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports.
