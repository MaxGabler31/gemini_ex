(a) Business Development
 
The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 8,2021, under Gankit Corporation. The Company was development stage company as an e-commerce business focused on selling a diverse set of products through its website Gankit.com.
 
On May 12, 2014, the control block of stock, 20,000,000 shares of restricted common stock were purchased resulting in a change of control. The Company then ceased to operate its e-commerce website and abandoned that business model, and re-focused on the development, branding, and distribution of non-flame smoking devices. The Company changed its name at this time to Nhale, Inc.
 
Business operations for Nhale Inc. was abandoned by former management and a custodianship action, as described in the subsequent paragraph, was commenced in 2020. The Company filed its last 10-Q in 2016, this financial report included liabilities and debts. As of the date of this filing, these liabilities and debts have not been addressed.
 
On November 24. 2020, the Eighth District Court of Clark County, Nevada granted the Application for Appointment of Custodian as a result of the absence of a functioning board of directors and the revocation of the Company’s charter. The order appointed Small Cap Compliance, LLC (“SCC”, the “Custodian”) custodian with the right to appoint officers and directors, negotiate and compromise debt, execute contracts, issue stock, and authorize new classes of stock. Rhonda Keaveney is the sole member and control person for Small Cap Compliance, LLC.

In addition, the company was subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements including filing 10-Q’s and 10-Ks. The Company filed its last 10-Q for quarter ending November 30, 2016 and was out of compliance with Exchange Act reporting. SCC attempted to contact the Company’s officers and directors through letters, emails, and phone calls, with no success.
 
The Custodian was a shareholder in the Company and applied to the Court for an Order appointing SCC as the Custodian. This application was for the purpose of reinstating NHLE’s corporate charter to do business and restoring value to the Company for the benefit of the stockholders.

(b) Business of Issuer
 
Nhale Inc. is a developmental stage company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 18, 2012. Our plan of business has not been implemented but will incorporate the implementation of carbon footprint neutrality and purification through artificial intelligence and emission reduction. Our target market will be both business and residential and include government agencies, schools, hospitals, health clubs, and family residences.
 
At present financial revenue has not yet been realized. The Company hopes to raise capital to fund its business plan.
 
All statements involving our business plan are forward looking statements and have not been implemented as of this filing.
 
The Company is moving in a new direction, statements made relating to our business plan are forward looking statements and we have no history of performance. Current management have limited experience in carbon footprint neutrality and purification but is actively looking for a suitable person to incorporate into the management team.
 
We feel that our business plan addresses the need for additional development in carbon reduction and neutrality.
 
We are in the business of carbon neutrality and air purification and will incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”) to achieve our goals.
 
Ambient air pollution is harmful to the environment and human health, and is a local, regional, and hemispheric issue. Climate change is a global challenge driven by the observed increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, as a result of emissions from human activities. Most air pollutants (APs) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) are closely interlinked, once they have common sources, which mainly arise from fuel combustion and industrial processes. Reductions in GHG emissions can bring ancillary benefits of improved air quality and reduced premature mortality, in addition to slowing climate change. Moreover, air quality co-benefits on morbidity, mortality, and agriculture could globally offset the costs of climate policy.

Our AI technology will perform air purification and optimization to reach carbon neutrality. Through our AI we will be able to access substances in the air, thus greatly improving efficiency and reducing energy consumption/emissions. The company currently plans to select 20 cities in the developed coastal areas and corresponding provincial capitals as the first phase cities that key services will be launched. The plan is expected to cover 600,000 spaces and benefit more than 2 million people. On this basis, services will be delivered in more cities gradually and the country's first community that focus on people’s health via respiratory health services. The projects that the company puts emphasis on fully conform to the Chinese government’s health strategy of establishing a national public health system and doing the work well in disease prevention and treatment. It is also in line with the international commitment of energy saving, emission reduction and carbon neutrality. It is a project with comprehensive benefits that meets international social and corporate needs. Our vision incorporates the spirit of social responsibility, not only on a local community basis but also on a global scale and is generally taken to include
 

· | Air purification 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company intends to implement its business plan upon raising capital. Subject to available capital, the Company intends to invest in:
 
Development

Implementation
 

· | Promoting local and international understanding and mindfulness 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Actively marketing our drones in local and global markets 
· | Market to government entities as role models for our product to encourage residential compliance

 
The analysis will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our management. As of the date of this filing, we have not entered into definitive agreements. In our continued efforts to analyze potential business plan, we intend to consider the following factors:
 

· | Potential for growth, indicated by anticipated market expansion or new technology 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Competitive position as compared to other competitors of similar size and experience within the carbon neutrality space, as well as within the industry as a whole 
· | Strength and diversity of management, and the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, services, professional assistance, and other required items 
· | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities or convertible debt, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced in the marketplace; and 
· | Other relevant factors

In applying the foregoing criteria, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. Additionally, we will be competing against other entities that may have greater financial, technical, and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing our business plan.
 
We are unable to predict when we will, if ever, identify and implement our business plan. We anticipate that proposed business plan would be made available to us through personal contacts of our directors, officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who introduce the Company to business opportunities in which we participate.
 
As of the time of this filing, the Company has not implemented its business plan.
 
We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management of the target business and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to the Company. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by third parties we may engage. We anticipate that we may rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash payments for services or expenses related to any analysis.
 
We may incur time and costs required to select and evaluate our business structure and complete our business plan, which cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective international education program that is not ultimately completed may result in a loss to the Company. These fees may include legal costs, accounting costs, finder’s fees, consultant’s fees and other related expenses. We have no present arrangements for any of these types of fees.
 
We anticipate that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys, consultants, and others. Costs may be incurred in the investigation process, which may not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in a loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
 
Competition
 
Our company expects to compete with many countries in the carbon neutrality and air purification industry. In addition, there are several competitors that are larger and more profitable than NHLE. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes. We believe that diligently establishing and expanding our funding sources will establish us in this emerging industry. Additionally, we expect that establishing our product offerings on new platforms are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new technology within the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our future operations and results.
 
Compliance with government standards and guidelines will increase development costs and the cost of operating our business. In turn, we may not be able to meet the competitive price point for our air purification products as dictated by the market and our competitors.
 
Again, these are forward looking statements and not an indication of past performance. There is no guarantee that we will be able to implement our business plan and have no merger candidates as of the time of this filing.

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
 
Upon effectiveness of this Form 10, we will be subject to the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Under the Exchange Act, we will be required to file with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act creates a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and to strengthen auditor independence. It also (1) requires steps be taken to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; (2) establishes clear statutory rules to limit possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; (3) creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, and compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; (4) prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; and (5) establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions.
 
We will also be subject to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14A. Preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are provided to our stockholders.
 
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2021, we had one officer and director. We anticipate that we will begin to fill out our management team as and when we raise capital to begin implementing our business plan. In the interim, we will utilize independent consultants to assist with accounting and administrative matters. We currently have no employment agreements and believe our consulting relationships are satisfactory. We plan to continue to hire independent consultants from time to time on an as-needed basis.
