Memorialization:
The Memorialization segment manufactures and markets a full line of memorialization products used primarily in cemeteries, funeral homes and crematories. The segment's products, which are sold principally in North America, Europe and Australia, include cast bronze memorials, granite memorials, caskets, cremation-related products, cremation and incineration equipment and other memorialization products. The segment also manufactures and markets architectural products that are used to identify or commemorate people, places, events and accomplishments.
Memorial products include flush bronze and granite memorials, upright granite memorials and monuments, concrete burial vaults, cremation memorialization products, granite benches, flower vases, crypt plates and letters, cremation urns, niche units, cemetery features and statues, along with other related products and services. Flush memorials are bronze plaques or granite memorials that contain personal information about a deceased individual (such as name, birth date and death date), photos and emblems. Flush bronze and granite memorials are even or "flush" with the ground and therefore are preferred by many cemeteries for easier lawn mowing and general maintenance. The segment's memorial products also include community and family mausoleums within North America. The segment's other memorial products include bronze plaques, letters, emblems, vases, lights and photo ceramics that can be affixed to granite monuments, mausoleums, crypts and flush memorials. Principal customers for memorial products are cemeteries and memorial parks, which in turn sell the Company's products to the consumer.
The Memorialization segment manufactures a full line of cremation-related products, including cremation urns in a variety of sizes, styles and shapes as well as standard and custom designed granite cremation pedestals and benches. Manufactured bronze and granite niche units are comprised of numerous compartments used to display cremation urns in mausoleums and churches. The Company also markets turnkey cremation gardens that include design and all related products for a cremation memorial garden.
Customers of the Memorialization segment can purchase memorials and vases on a "pre-need" basis. This concept permits families to arrange for these purchases in advance of their actual need. Upon request, the Company will manufacture the memorial to the customer's specifications (e.g., name and birth date) and place it in storage for future delivery. Memorials in storage have been paid in full with title conveyed to each pre-need purchaser.

These products are sold to and distributed through a network of independent dealers including sign suppliers, awards and recognition companies, and trophy dealers.
ITEM 1.        BUSINESS, (continued)

Raw materials used by the Memorialization segment to manufacture memorials consist principally of bronze and aluminum ingot, granite, sheet metal, coating materials, photopolymers and construction materials and are generally available in adequate supply. Ingot is obtained from various North American, European and Australian smelters. The primary materials required for casket manufacturing are cold-rolled steel and lumber. The segment also purchases copper, bronze, stainless steel, particleboard, corrugated materials, paper veneer, cloth, ornamental hardware and coating materials. Purchase orders or supply agreements are typically negotiated with large, integrated steel producers that have demonstrated timely delivery, high quality material and competitive prices. Lumber is purchased from a number of sawmills and lumber distributors. Raw materials used to manufacture cremation and incineration products consist principally of structural steel, sheet metal, electrical components, combustion devices and refractory materials. These are generally available in adequate supply from numerous suppliers.
Competition from other manufacturers of memorial products is based on reputation, product quality, delivery, price, and design availability. The Company believes that its superior quality, broad product lines, innovative designs, delivery capability, customer responsiveness, experienced personnel and consumer-oriented merchandising systems are competitive advantages in its markets. Competition in the mausoleum construction industry includes various construction companies throughout North America and is based on design, quality and price. Competitors in the architectural market are numerous and include companies that manufacture cast and painted signs, plastic materials, sand-blasted wood and other fabricated products.
The Memorialization segment markets its casket products in the United States through a combination of Company-owned and independent casket distribution facilities. The Company operates approximately 75 distribution centers in the United States. Approximately 85% of the segment's casket products are currently sold through Company-owned distribution centers. The casket business is highly competitive and the Company competes with other manufacturers based on product quality, price, service, design availability and breadth of product line. The Memorialization segment provides a line of casket products that it believes is as comprehensive as any of its major competitors. There are a large number of casket industry participants operating in North America, and a few foreign casket manufacturers, primarily from China, participating in the North American market. 
The Company competes with several manufacturers in the cremation and accessory equipment market principally based on product design, quality and price. The Memorialization segment and its three largest global competitors account for a substantial portion of the United States and European cremation equipment market.
The Memorialization segment works to provide a total solution to customers that own and operate businesses in both the cemetery and funeral home markets. The Company's memorial and casket products serve the relatively stable casketed and in-ground burial death market, while its memorial products and cremation and incineration equipment also serve the growing cremation market.
Industrial Technologies:
The Industrial Technologies segment includes the design, manufacturing, service and distribution of high-tech custom energy storage solutions, product identification and warehouse automation technologies and solutions, including order fulfillment systems for identifying, tracking, picking and conveying consumer and industrial products. 
The energy storage solutions business produces engineered calendering, laminating, and coating equipment used in the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries and components of fuel cells.

The business is globally active with well-established customer relations. 
The energy storage solutions business has experienced significant growth primarily reflecting expanded use of electric vehicles, as well as the expansion of renewable energy production globally. The segment has nearly a decade of experience in developing dry electrode lithium-ion battery solutions. Dry electrode technology makes producing lithium-ion batteries easier and less expensive than the wet electrode process, and dry electrode manufacturing is also less impactful on the environment. These factors could contribute to increased utilization of dry electrode batteries in the electric vehicle market, and thus greater demand for this form of battery in the future. 
ITEM 1.        BUSINESS, (continued)

Product identification systems range from stand-alone marking products to complex ink-jet printing systems that integrate into a customer's production process. The Company manufactures and markets products and systems that employ different marking technologies, including laser and ink-jet printing. These technologies apply product information required for identification and traceability, as well as to facilitate inventory and quality control, regulatory compliance and brand name communication. The segment also develops innovative, custom solutions to address specific customer requirements in a variety of industries, including oil field services and security scanning.
Warehouse automation systems complement the tracking and distribution of a customer's products with automated order fulfillment technologies, and controls for material handling systems. Material handling customers include some of the largest retail, e-commerce, and third-party logistics companies in the United States. 
A significant portion of the revenue of the Industrial Technologies segment is attributable to the sale of consumables and replacement parts required by the marking, coding and tracking products sold by Matthews. The Company develops inks exclusively for the use with its marking equipment, which is critical to ensure ongoing equipment reliability and mark quality.
The principal customers for the Company's marking and fulfillment systems products are manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of durable goods, building products, consumer goods manufacturers (including food and beverage processors) and producers of pharmaceuticals. The Company also serves a wide variety of industrial markets, including metal fabricators, manufacturers of woven and non-woven fabrics, plastic, rubber and automotive products.
A portion of this segment's sales are outside the United States, sourced through the Company's subsidiaries in Sweden, Germany, Malaysia and China in addition to other international distributors. The Company owns a minority interest in distributors in Asia, Australia and Europe.

Competitors in the marking and fulfillment systems industries are diverse, with some companies offering limited product lines for well-defined specialty markets, while others operate similarly to the Company, offering a broad product line and competing in multiple product markets and countries. Competitive differentiation for marking and fulfillment systems products is based on product performance, ease of integration into the manufacturing and/or distribution process, service and price. The Company typically competes with specialty companies in specific brand marking solutions and traceability applications. In the energy storage solutions business, the Company has patents and pending patent applications on its dry electrode calendering equipment. The Company believes that, in general, its Industrial Technologies segment offers one of the broadest lines of products to address a wide variety of high-tech custom energy storage solutions, product identification and warehouse automation applications.

These services include design and adaptive packaging design, production art, photography, retouching, the creation of e-commerce assets, premedia, print technical services, cylinder and flexo printing plate production, workflow efficiency consulting, change management and technology workflow solutions. Historically a print media based business, the business leverages their 100+ years of packaging expertise to create packaging assets required for the e-commerce channel. The business has evolved from creating and delivering graphic brand assets for a single medium (package on shelf) which required output for printing, into one that is deeply entrenched in a brand’s journey across multiple mediums, requiring an almost infinite array of digital asset output across an ever-expanding multi-channel universe.
The brand experience part of the business integrates all marketing-related services from the beginning to the end of the marketing development workflow process. Clients may purchase stand-alone services or a combination of services that are designed to fulfill larger, more strategic objectives.

The segment generates new business opportunities through referrals and relationships, marketing and lead generation and select industry partnerships. The Company has many long-standing relationships among its client base that span decades and has new relationships with well-known global technology companies that are driving change in how consumers engage with brands and use devices like smartphones to shop and buy online and in-store.
Major raw materials for this segment’s products include photopolymers, steel, copper, film, wood, corrugated materials, structural steel, plastic, laminates, inks and graphic art supplies. All such materials are presently available in adequate supply from various industry sources. Competition is on the basis of product quality, timeliness of delivery and price, and increasingly, the ability to provide a holistic solution for brand content beyond its use for packaging, while at the same time elevating the role of packaging in the marketing mix. The segment's ability to offer consistent service on a global basis is a key differentiator. 
The segment competes in an industry that is constantly challenged by emerging technologies that impact packaging and marketing. These challenges can create new opportunities for the segment to create, produce and manage large volumes of brand content. They also provide the segment with opportunities to advise its clients on how to plan for, manage and execute the digital transformation of their packaging and marketing operations.

Many of Matthews’ employees have highly specialized skills and subject-matter expertise in their respective disciplines, enabling the Company to deliver industry leading products and services to its customers throughout the world. 
Diversity and Inclusion:

The Company understands and firmly believes in the value that diverse experiences, perspectives, and ideas bring to the workforce and offer to clients. Matthews knows its employees deserve equal opportunities regardless of race, gender, gender expression, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation and more. 
As an organization with a history that spans more than 170 years, Matthews has always believed that mutual respect, valuing the worth of all people, doing what's right and celebrating diversity is essential to how the Company operates and the way it does business. Matthews’ D&I strategy focuses on four pillars: Infrastructure, Talent Acquisition, Employee Engagement and Community Engagement. A global council representative of a diverse workforce exists to help shape plans and program priorities across these pillars and to champion the work to build a more inclusive culture, and a full time D&I leader is actively focused on driving progress in this area. Matthews is a unique organization, diverse in culture, talent and geography. The Company stands committed to a culture reflecting the people, clients, customers, and communities it serves.

To continue to grow and compete in a highly competitive labor market, Matthews works hard to attract and select top talent through a compelling employment value proposition. The Company’s employment brand highlights its values, commitment to people culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, employee development and the efforts to ensure cultural alignment, and the selection process includes key behavioral questions that help select the right people for the right roles. 
Matthews understands the highly competitive market for talent and believes that to attract and retain top talent, it must offer competitive pay and benefit programs. The Company evaluates roles to ensure pay is at market rate, and offers annual incentive pay and a competitive benefit package. As a global company, adjustments are made for global and regional market demands.
Talent Development/Management:
From onboarding to leadership development, Matthews believes investing in its people leads to greater success. The Company’s onboarding program reinforces its values and culture, supports its managers in creating a positive employee experience during the first 90 days and builds early commitment with all new hires. 
Matthews knows that when employees have opportunities to learn and grow, see how their goals and objectives lead to something greater and understand their part in the organization’s success, it helps build a place where people want to stay. Matthews’ competency-based learning center helps employees select learning programs to continue their growth, and the Company facilitates both formal and informal mentoring that reinforces and supports its leaders during key developmental periods and beyond.
ITEM 1.        BUSINESS, (continued)

The Company’s future success depends upon tomorrow’s leaders. Matthews has implemented a robust talent review process that identifies critical talent and serves as the basis for succession planning. Each year, at the conclusion of this review, the executive team selects a cohort of critical talent to participate in a comprehensive leadership program designed to prepare leaders for enterprise roles. The Company believes this investment, which includes classroom learning, assessments, coaching/mentoring and project application, both prepares and strengthens the organization for the future, while deepening the commitment of its top talent.
Performance Management:
Connecting employees to the strategy ensures individual effort to a larger goal and strengthens commitment to the organization. The Company supports an annual leadership strategy cascade where each segment, division, group and team identify and align goals and objectives which serve as the basis for individual performance objectives, keeping employees firmly connected to the work and the Company’s collective success. This process is rooted in ongoing coaching and feedback, and measures not just what was accomplished, but how it was accomplished because Matthews believes staying true to its values and key behaviors serves clients better, strengthens culture and keeps employees engaged. 
Change Management:
Matthews is a constantly evolving multi-national company, leveraging new ways of working to improve its quality, service and delivery systems to better help customers and clients succeed. Building change capability to support employees through changes accelerates new ways of working, minimizes productivity loss, and accelerates improvement measures. 
Health and Safety:
Employee health and safety in the workplace remains the Company’s highest priority and is one of the Company’s core values. Safety efforts are led by the global health and safety team and supported by individuals at the local site level. Hazards in the workplace are timely identified and management actively tracks incidents so remedial actions may be implemented to improve workplace safety.
BACKLOG:
Because the nature of the Company's Memorialization, Industrial Technologies, and SGK Brand Solutions businesses are primarily custom products made to order and services with short lead times, backlogs are not generally material except for mausoleums and cremation and incineration equipment in the Memorialization segment, and purpose-built machinery, warehouse automation and order fulfillment projects in the Industrial Technologies segment. Cremation and incineration equipment sales backlogs vary in a range of ten to twelve months of sales. Backlogs vary in a range of approximately twelve to eighteen months of sales for mausoleums. Backlogs are generally in excess of a year for purpose-built machinery projects. Backlogs for warehouse automation and fulfillment systems generally vary in a range of up to four weeks for standard products, and are currently in the range of ten to twelve months for custom systems. The Company's current backlog is expected to be substantially filled in fiscal 2023.
