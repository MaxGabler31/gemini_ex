ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and unless otherwise indicated, the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to NaturalShrimp Incorporated and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: NaturalShrimp USA Corporation (“NSC”) and NaturalShrimp Global, Inc. (“NS Global”) and Natural Aquatic Systems, Inc. (“NAS”). Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States Dollars.
 
Business Overview
 
We are a biotechnology company and have developed proprietary platform technologies that allow us to grow Pacific White shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei, formerly Penaeus vannamei) in an ecologically controlled, high-density, low-cost environment, and in fully contained and independent production facilities. Our system uses technology which allows us to produce a naturally grown shrimp “crop” weekly and accomplishes this without the use of antibiotics or toxic chemicals. We have developed several proprietary technology assets, including a knowledge base that allows us to produce commercial quantities of shrimp in a closed system with a computer monitoring system that automates, monitors, and maintains proper levels of oxygen, salinity, and temperature for optimal shrimp production. The Company’s production facilities are located in La Coste, Texas and Webster City, Iowa.
 
On October 16, 2015, we formed NAS. The purpose of NAS is to formalize the business relationship between our Company and F&T Water Solutions LLC (“F&T”) for the joint development of certain water technologies. The technologies shall include, without limitation, any and all inventions, patents, intellectual property, and know-how dealing with enclosed aquatic production systems worldwide. This includes construction, operation, and management of enclosed aquatic production, other than shrimp, facilities throughout the world, co-developed by both parties at our facility located outside of La Coste, Texas. On December 25, 2018, we were awarded U.S. Patent “Recirculating Aquaculture System and Treatment Method for Aquatic Species” covering all indoor aquatic species that utilizes proprietary art.
 
On December 15, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) between VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“VBF”), VBF Transport, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Transport”), and Iowa’s First, Inc., an Iowa corporation (“Iowa’s First”) (each a “Seller” and collectively, “Sellers”). Transport and Iowa’s First were wholly-owned subsidiaries of VBF. The agreement called for us to purchase all of the tangible assets of VBF, the motor vehicles of Transport and the real property (together with all plants, buildings, structures, fixtures, fittings, systems, and other improvements located on such real property) of Iowa’s First. The consideration was $10,000,000, consisting of $5,000,000 in cash, paid at closing on December 17, 2020, (ii) $3,000,000 payable in 36 months with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annuum, interest only payable quarterly on the first day of the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid to VBF as a balloon payment on the maturity date, and (iii) $2,000,000 payable in 48 months with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annuum, interest only payable quarterly on the first day of the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid to VBF as a balloon payment on the maturity date. The Company also agreed to issue 500,000 shares of Common Stock as a finder’s fee.

The facility was originally designed as an aquaculture facility, with the company having production issues. The Company’s has begun a modification process to convert the plant to produce shrimp, which will allow them to scale faster without having to build new facilities. The three Iowa facilities contain the tanks and infrastructure that will be used to support the production of shrimp with the incorporation of the Company’s Electrocoagulation (EC) platform technology.
 
On May 19, 2021, the Company entered into a Patents Purchase Agreement (the “Patents Agreement”) with F&T. The Company and F&T had previously jointly developed and patented a water treatment technology used or useful in growing aquatic species in re-circulating and enclosed environments (the “Patent”) with each party owning a fifty percent (50%) interest. Upon the closing of the Patents Agreement, the Company would purchase F&T’s interest in the Patent, F&T’s 100% interest in a second patent associated with the first Patent issued to F&T in March 2018, and all other intellectual property rights owned by F&T for a purchase price of $2,000,000 in cash and issue 9,900,990 shares of the Company’s common stock with a market value of $0.505 per share for a total fair value of $5,000,000, for a total acquisition price of $7,000,000. The Company paid the cash purchase price on May 20, 2021 and the closing of the Patents Agreement took place on May 25, 2021.
 
On August 25, 2021, the Company, through its 100% owned subsidiary NAS, entered into an Equipment Rights Agreements with Hydrenesis-Delta Systems, LLC (“Hydrenesis-Delta”) and a Technology Rights Agreement, in a sub-license agreement with Hydrenesis Aquaculture LLC (“Hydrenesis-Aqua”), The Equipment Rights involve specialized and proprietary equipment used to produce and control, dose, and infuse Hydrogas® and RLS® into both water and other chemical species, while the Technology sublicense pertains to the rights to Hydrogas® and RLS®. Both Rights agreements are for a 10 year term, which shall automatically renew for ten year successive terms. The term can be terminated by written notice by mutual consent, or by either party upon a breach of contract, insolvency or filing of bankruptcy. The agreements accord the exclusive rights to purchase or distribute the technology, or buy or rent the equipment, in the Industry Sector, which is the primary business and revenue stream generated from indoor aquaculture farming of any species in the Territory, defined as anywhere in the world except for the countries in the Gulf Corporation Council.
 
The Company has three wholly-owned subsidiaries: NSC, NS Global, and NAS.
 
Evolution of Technology
 
Historically, efforts to raise shrimp in a high-density, closed system at the commercial level have been met with either modest success or outright failure through “BioFloc Technology.” Infectious agents such as parasites, bacteria and viruses are the most damaging and most difficult to control. Bacterial infection can in some cases be combated through the use of antibiotics (although not always), and in general, the use of antibiotics is considered undesirable and counter to “green” cultivation practices. Viruses can be worse, in that they are immune to antibiotics. Once introduced to a shrimp population, viruses can wipe out entire farms and shrimp populations, even with intense probiotic applications.
 
Our primary solution against infectious agents is our “Vibrio Suppression Technology.” We believe this system creates higher sustainable densities, consistent production, improved growth and survival rates and improved food conversion without the use of antibiotics, probiotics, or unhealthy anti-microbial chemicals. Vibrio Suppression Technology helps to exclude and suppress harmful organisms that usually destroy “BioFloc” and other enclosed technologies.
 
In 2001, we began research and development of a high density, natural aquaculture system that is not dependent on ocean water to provide quality, fresh shrimp every week, fifty-two weeks a year. Our initial system was successful, but we determined that it would not be economically feasible due to high operating costs. Over the next several years, using the knowledge we gained from developing the first system, we developed a shrimp production system that eliminated the high costs associated with the previous system. We have continued to refine this technology, eliminating bacteria and other problems that affect enclosed systems, and now have a successful shrimp growing process. We have produced thousands of pounds of shrimp over the last few years in order to develop a design that will consistently produce quality shrimp that grow to a large size at a specific rate of growth. This included experimenting with various types of natural live and synthesized feed supplies before selecting the most appropriate nutritious and reliable combination. It also included utilizing monitoring and control automation equipment to minimize labor costs and to provide the necessary oversight for proper regulation of the shrimp environment. However, there were further enhancements needed to our process and technology in order to begin production of shrimp on a commercially viable scale and to generate revenues.

Our current system consists of a nursery tank where the shrimp are acclimated, then moved to a larger grow-out tank for the rest of the twenty-week cycle. During 2016, we engaged in additional engineering projects with third parties to further enhance our indoor production capabilities. For example, through our relationship with Trane, Inc., a division of Ingersoll-Rand Plc (“Trane”), Trane provided a detailed audit to use data to build and verify the capabilities of then initial Phase 1 prototype of a Trane-proposed three tank system at our La Coste, Texas facility. The Company working with F&T Water Solutions contracted RGA Labs, Inc. (“RGA Labs”) to build the initial NaturalShrimp patented Electrocoagulation system for the grow-out, harvesting and processing of fully mature, antibiotic-free Pacific White Leg shrimp. The design provided a viable pathway to begin generating revenue and producing shrimp on a commercially viable scale. The equipment was installed in early June 2018 by RGA Labs, and final financing for the system was provided by one of the Company’s institutional investors. The first post larvae (PL) arrived from the hatchery on July 3, 2018. The Company used the shrimp for sampling to key potential customers and special events such as the Texas Restaurant Association trade show. The Company also received two production PL lots from Global Blue Technologies on March 21, 2019 and April 17, 2019 and from American Penaeid, Inc. on August 7, 2019. Because the shrimp displayed growth that was slower than normal, the Company had a batch tested by an independent lab at the University of Arizona. The shrimp tested positive for Infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis (“IHHNV”) and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department was notified that the facility was under quarantine. On August 26, 2019, the Company was forced to terminate all lots due to the infection. On August 30, 2019, the Company received notice that it was in compliance again and the quarantine had been lifted and the Company began restocking shrimp in the refurbished facility sections. During the aforementioned quarantine, the Company decided to begin an approximately $2,000,000 facility renovation demolishing the interior 16 wood structure lined tanks (720,000 gallons). The Company began replacing the previous tanks with 40 new fiberglass tanks (600,000 gallons) at a cost of approximately $400,000 allowing complete production flexibility with more smaller tanks.
 
On March 18, 2020, our research and development plant in La Coste, Texas was destroyed by a fire. The Company believed that it was caused by a natural gas leak, but the fire was so extensive that the cause was undetermined. No one was injured as a result of the fire. The majority of the damage was to our pilot production plant, which comprised approximately 35,000 square feet of the total size of all facilities at the La Coste location of approximately 53,000 square feet, but the fire did not impact the separate greenhouse, reservoirs, or utility buildings. We received total insurance proceeds in the amount of $917,210, the full amount of our claim. These funds were utilized to rebuild a 40,000 square foot production facility at the La Coste facility and to repurchase the equipment needed to replace what was lost in the fire. As of the date of this report, this facility is production-ready and, while we have experienced supply chain issues due to COVID-19, we expect the combined output from the La Coste, Texas, and Webster City, Iowa should result in a total of 25,000 pounds of shrimp production for the calendar quarter that will end on June 30, 2022. Also, the Company is expecting to break ground on an 80,000 square foot expansion in La Coste during the calendar quarter that will end on September 30, 2022.
 
Overview of Industry
 
Shrimp is a well-known and globally-consumed commodity, constituting one of the most important types of seafood and a staple protein source for much of the world. According to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service, the world consumes approximately 9 billion pounds of shrimp annually with over 1.7 billion pounds consumed in the United States alone. Approximately 65% of the global supply of shrimp is caught by ocean trawlers and the other 35% is produced by open-air shrimp farms, mostly in developing countries.
 
Shrimp boats catch shrimp through the use of large, boat-towed nets. These nets are quite toxic to the undersea environment as they disturb and destroy ocean-bottom ecosystems; these nets also catch a variety of non-shrimp sea life, which is typically killed and discarded as part of the shrimp harvesting process. Additionally, the world’s oceans can only supply a finite amount of shrimp each year, and in fact, single-boat shrimp yields have fallen by approximately 20% since 2010 and continue to decrease. The shrimping industry’s answer to this problem has been to deploy more (and larger) boats that deploy ever-larger nets, which has in the short-term been successful at maintaining global shrimp yields. However, this benefit cannot continue forever, as eventually global demand has the potential of outstripping the oceans’ ability to maintain the natural ecosystem’s balance, resulting in a permanent decline in yields. When taken in light of global population growth and the ever-increasing demand for nutrient-rich foods such as shrimp, this is clearly an unsustainable production paradigm.

Shrimp farming, known in the industry as “aquaculture,” has ostensibly stepped in to fill this demand/supply imbalance. Shrimp farming is typically done in open-air lagoons and man-made shrimp ponds connected to the open ocean. Because these ponds constantly exchange water with the adjacent sea, the farmers are able to maintain the water chemistry that allows the shrimp to prosper. However, this method of cultivating shrimp also carries severe ecological peril. First of all, most shrimp farming is primarily conducted in developing countries, where poor shrimp farmers have little regard for the global ecosystem. Because of this, these farmers use large quantities of antibiotics and other chemicals that maximize each farm’s chance of producing a crop, putting the entire system at risk. For example, a viral infection that crops up in one farm can spread to all nearby farms, quite literally wiping out an entire region’s production. In 1999, the White Spot virus invaded shrimp farms in at least five Latin American countries: Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Panama, and Ecuador and in 2013-14 EMS (Early Mortality Syndrome) wiped out most of the Asia Pacific region and Mexico. Secondly, there is also a finite amount of coastline that can be used for shrimp production – eventually shrimp farms that are dependent on the open ocean will have nowhere to expand. Again, this is an ecologically damaging and ultimately unsustainable system for producing shrimp.
 
In both the cases, the current method of shrimp production is unsustainable. As global populations rise and the demand for shrimp continues to grow, the current system is bound to fall short. Shrimp trawling cannot continue to increase production without completely depleting the oceans’ natural shrimp population. Trends in per-boat yield confirm that this industry has already crossed the overfishing threshold, putting the global open-ocean shrimp population in decline. While open-air shrimp aquaculture may seem to address this problem, it is also an unsustainable system that destroys coastal ecological systems and produces shrimp with very high chemical contamination levels. Closed-system shrimp farming is clearly a superior alternative, but its unique challenges have prevented it from becoming a widely-available alternative.
 
Of the 1.7 billion pounds of shrimp consumed annually in the United States, over 1.5 billion pounds are imported – much of this from developing countries’ shrimp farms. These farms are typically located in developing countries and use high levels of antibiotics and pesticides that are not allowed under USDA regulations. As a result, these shrimp farms produce chemical-laden shrimp in an ecologically unsustainable way.
 
Unfortunately, most consumers here in the United States are not aware of the origin of their store-bought shrimp or that which they consume in restaurants. This is due to a USDA rule that states that only bulk-packaged shrimp must state the shrimp’s country of origin; any “prepared” shrimp, which includes arrangements sold in grocery stores and seafood markets, as well as all shrimp served in restaurants, can simply be sold “as is.” Essentially, this means that most U.S. consumers may be eating shrimp laden with chemicals and antibiotics. Our product is free of pesticide chemicals and antibiotics, a fact that we believe is highly attractive and beneficial in terms of our eventual marketing success.
 
Technology
 
Intensive, Indoor, Closed-System Shrimp Production Technology
 
Historically, efforts to raise shrimp in a high-density, closed system at the commercial level have been met with either modest success or outright failure through “BioFloc Technology”. Infectious agents such as parasites, bacteria and viruses are the most damaging and most difficult to control. Bacterial infection can in some cases be combated through the use of antibiotics (although not always), and in general, the use of antibiotics is considered undesirable and counter to “green” cultivation practices. Viruses can be even worse, in that they are immune to antibiotics. Once introduced to a shrimp population, viruses can wipe out entire farms and shrimp populations, even with intense probiotic applications.
 
Our primary solution against infectious agents is our “Vibrio Suppression Technology”. We believe this system creates higher sustainable densities, consistent production, improved growth and survival rates and improved food conversion without the use of antibiotics, probiotics, or unhealthy anti-microbial chemicals. Vibrio Suppression Technology helps to exclude and suppress harmful organisms that usually destroy “BioFloc” and other enclosed technologies.

Our technology platforms combine electrocoagulation and hydrogas. Our patented electrocoagulation system replaces the need for biofilters and uses electronics to remove ammonia and to control the level of pathogens in an aquaculture system. The hydrogas system reduces mortality rates and increases growth rates of aquatic species. These technologies produce an anti-oxidative water chemistry beneficial to the health of the aquatic species.
 
Automated Monitoring and Control System
 
The Company’s “Automated Monitoring and Control System” uses individual tank monitors to automatically control the feeding, oxygenation, and temperature of each of the facility tanks independently. In addition, a facility computer running custom software communicates with each of the controllers and performs additional data acquisition functions that can report back to a supervisory computer from anywhere in the world. These computer-automated water controls optimize the growing conditions for the shrimp as they mature to harvest size, providing a disease-resistant production environment.
 
The principal theories behind the Company’s system are characterized as:
 

● | High-density shrimp production 
--+-----------------------------------
● | Weekly production 
● | Natural ecology system 
● | Regional production 
● | Regional distribution 

 
These principles form the foundation for the Company and our potential distributors so that consumers can be provided with continuous volumes of live and fresh shrimp at competitive prices.
 
Research and Development
 
In 2001, we began research and development (R&D) of a high density, natural aquaculture system that is not dependent on ocean water to provide quality, fresh shrimp every week, fifty-two weeks per year. Our initial system was successful, but the Company determined that it would not be economically feasible due to high operating costs. Over the next several years, using the knowledge we gained from the first R&D system, we developed a shrimp production system that eliminated the high costs associated with the previous system. We have continued to refine this technology, eliminating bacteria and other problems that affect enclosed systems and now have a successful shrimp growing process.
 
We have produced thousands of pounds of shrimp over the last few years in order to develop a design that will consistently produce quality shrimp that grow to a large size at a specific rate of growth. This included experimenting with various types of natural live and synthesized feed supplies before selecting the most appropriate nutritious and reliable combination. It also included utilizing monitoring and control automation equipment to minimize labor costs and to provide the necessary oversight for proper regulation of the shrimp environment.
 
On December 15, 2020, we acquired all of the tangible assets of VBF, the motor vehicles of Transport and the real property (together with all plants, buildings, structures, fixtures, fittings, systems, and other improvements located on such real property) of Iowa’s First. The facility was originally designed as a farming facility, with the company never beginning production. We are converting five, 50,000 square foot separate internal production buildings within the 270,000 square foot external building during 2022 to produce shrimp. We expect to complete the retrofit of two of the 50,000 square foot buildings by July 2022.  The three Iowa facilities contain the tanks and infrastructure that will be used to support the production of shrimp with the incorporation of the Company’s patented EC and Hydrenesis platform technologies.
 
Target Markets and Sales Price
 
We are establishing two target markets. One is fresh and never frozen and the second one is the live market. Our goal is to establish production systems and distribution centers in regional areas of the United States, as well as international distribution networks through joint venture partnerships throughout the world. This should allow the Company to capture a significant portion of world shrimp sales by offering locally grown, environmentally friendly, fresh shrimp at competitive wholesale prices.

The United States population is approximately 330 million people with an annual shrimp consumption of 1.7 billion pounds, of which less than 400 million pounds are domestically produced. According to IndexMundi.com, from January 2006 through January 2021, the wholesale price for frozen, commodity grade shrimp (shell-on headless, 26-30 count; which is comparable to our target growth size) rose 18%. With world shrimp problems, this price is expected to rise more in the next few years.
 
We strive to build a profitable global shrimp production company. We believe our foundational advantage is that we can deliver fresh, organically grown, gourmet-grade shrimp, 52 weeks per year to retail and wholesale buyers in major market areas at competitive, yet premium prices. By locating regional production and distribution centers in close proximity to consumer demand, we can provide a fresh product to customers within 24 hours after harvest, which is unique in the shrimp industry. We can be the “first to market” and perhaps “sole weekly provider” of fresh shrimp and capture as much market share as production capacity can support.
 
For those customers that want a frozen product, we could be able to provide this in the near future and the product will still be differentiated as a “naturally grown, sustainable seafood” that will meet the increasing demand of socially conscious consumers.
 
Our patented technology and eco-friendly, bio-secure production processes enable the delivery of a chemical and antibiotic free, locally grown product that lives up to the Company’s mantra: “Always Fresh, Always Natural,” thereby solving the issue of “unsafe” imported seafood.
 
Product Description
 
Nearly all of the shrimp consumed today are shipped frozen. Shrimp are typically frozen from six to twenty-four months before consumption. Our system is designed to harvest a different tank each week, which provides for fresh shrimp throughout the year. We strive to create a niche market of “Always Fresh, Always Natural” shrimp. As opposed to many of the foreign shrimp farms, we can also claim that our product is 100% free of antibiotics. The ability to grow shrimp locally, year-round allows us to provide this high-end product to upscale restaurant and grocery stores throughout the world. We rotate the stocking and harvesting of our tanks each week, which allows for weekly shrimp harvests. Our product is free of all pollutants and is fed only the highest quality feeds.
 
The seafood industry lacks a consistent “Source Verification” method to track seafood products as they move through countries and customs procedures. With worldwide overfishing leading to declining shrimp freshness and sustainability around the world, it is vital for shrimp providers to be able to realistically identify the source of their product. We have well-managed, sustainable facilities that are able to track shrimp from hatchery to plate using environmentally responsible methods.
 
Shrimp Growth Period
 
Our production system is designed to produce shrimp at a harvest size of twenty-one to twenty-five shrimp per pound in a period of twenty weeks. We currently purchase post-larva shrimp that are approximately ten days old (PL 10). In the future, we plan to build our own hatcheries to control the supply of shrimp to each of our facilities. Our full-scale production systems include grow-out and nursery tanks, projected to produce fresh shrimp fifty-two weeks per year.
Distribution and Marketing
 
We plan to build environmentally friendly production systems near major metropolitan areas of the United States. Today, we have one, 40,000 square foot production facility in La Coste, Texas (near San Antonio) and three production facilities totaling 344,000 square feet in Iowa. We signed a joint venture agreement with Hydrenesis to build a 240,000 square foot production facility in Florida. Over the next five years, our plan is to increase construction of new regional production facilities each year. In the fifth year, we are expecting to plan for new regional production facilities to be completed.

Because our system is enclosed and also indoors, it is not affected by weather or climate and does not depend on ocean proximity. As such, we believe we will be able to provide, naturally grown, high-quality, fresh shrimp to major market customers each week. This will allow distribution companies to leverage their existing customer relationships by offering an uninterrupted supply of high quality, fresh and locally grown shrimp. We plan to sell and distribute the vast majority of our shrimp production through distributors which have established customers and sufficient capacity to deliver a fresh product within hours following harvest. We believe we have the added advantage of being able to market our shrimp as fresh, natural, and locally grown using sustainable, eco-friendly technology, a key differentiation from all existing shrimp producers. Furthermore, we believe that our ability to advertise our product in this manner along with the fact that it is a locally grown product, provides us with a marketing advantage over the competition. We expect to utilize distributors that currently supply fresh seafood to upscale restaurants and supermarkets, country clubs, and retail stores whose clientele expect and appreciate fresh, natural products.
 
Harvesting, Packaging and Shipment
 
Each location is projected to include production, harvesting/processing and a general shipping and receiving area, in addition to warehousing space for storage of necessary supplies and products required to grow, harvest, package and otherwise make ready for delivery, a fresh shrimp crop on a weekly basis to consumers in each individual market area within 24 hours following harvest.
 
The seafood industry lacks a consistent source verification method to track seafood products as they move through countries and customs procedures. With worldwide overfishing leading to declining shrimp freshness and sustainability around the world, it is vital for shrimp providers to be able to realistically identify the source of their product. Our future facilities are expected to be designed to track shrimp from hatchery to plate using environmentally responsible methods.
 
International
 
We own one hundred percent of NaturalShrimp Global, Inc., which was formed to create international partnerships and licensing for our platform technologies. Each international partnership is expected to use the Company’s proprietary technology to penetrate shrimp markets throughout the world utilizing existing food service distribution channels.
Go to Market Strategy and Execution
 
Our strategy is to acquire or develop regional production and distribution centers or joint ventures near major metropolitan areas throughout the United States and internationally. Along with our reconstruction of our La Coste facility that includes an 8,000 square foot water treatment plant and a 40,000 square foot production facility and our purchase of 344,000 square foot production facilities and production assets from VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc. Our current plan includes a NaturalShrimp Iowa expansion, a La Coste, TX expansion, Hydrenesis joint ventures while developing regional production and distribution centers near major markets, adding production centers in Florida, Nevada, and New York.
 
We have sold limited amounts of product to restaurants at $12.00 per pound and to retail consumers at $16.50 to $21.00 per pound, depending on size, which helps to validate our pricing strategy. Additionally, from 2011 to 2013, we had two successful North Texas test markets which distributed thousands of pounds of fresh product to customers within 24 hours following harvest. The fresh/live product was priced from $10.00 to $12.00 per pound wholesale, heads on, net price to the Company.
 
Current Systems and Expansion
 
The shrimp production facility rebuilt in La Coste, Texas is using new patent-pending technologies the Company developed with Trane’s engineering audit, F&T Water Solutions, and Hydrenesis. This facility utilizing the aforementioned platform technologies is projected to produce approximately 3,000 pounds of shrimp every week. By staging the stocking and harvests from tank to tank, it enables us to produce weekly and therefore deliver fresh shrimp every week.

With our acquisition of NaturalShrimp Iowa (formerly Veroblue Farms USA, Inc.), the Company will utilize the aforementioned platform technologies to retrofit 344,000 square feet of the existing Iowa facilities that we expect to produce 12,000 pounds of shrimp per week. The combined output from La Coste, TX and Iowa should result in 15,000 pounds of shrimp production per week by the first quarter of 2023.
 
The regional production facilities to be located in Florida, Nevada, and New York are expected to begin construction from future funding. These production centers are not surrounded by commercial shrimp production, and we believe there will be a high demand for fresh shrimp in all of these locations. In addition, the Company will continue to use the land it owns in La Coste and Iowa to build as many systems as the Texas and Iowa markets demand.
 
Competition
 
There are a number of companies conducting research and development projects in their attempt to develop closed-system technologies in the U.S., some with reported production and sales. Most North American shrimp farms are using a Bio-Floc System to intensify shrimp growth. Since these are privately-held companies, it is not possible to know, with certainty, their state of technical development, production capacity, need for water exchange, location requirements, financial status, and other matters. To the best of our knowledge, none are producing significant quantities of shrimp relative to their local markets, and such fresh shrimp sales are likely confined to an area near the production facility.
 
Additionally, any new competitor would face significant barriers for entry into the market and would likely need years of research and development to develop the proprietary technology necessary to produce similar shrimp at a commercially viable level. We believe our technology and business model sets us apart from any current competition. It is possible that additional competitors will arise in the future, but with the size and growth of the worldwide shrimp market, many competitors could co-exist and thrive in the fresh shrimp industry.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We intend to take appropriate steps to protect our intellectual property. We have registered the trademark “NATURALSHRIMP” which has been approved and was published in the Official Gazette on June 5, 2012. On December 25, 2018, we were awarded U.S. Patent 10,163,199 “Recirculating Aquaculture System and Treatment Method for Aquatic Species” and, on April 12, 2022, we were awarded U.S. Patent 11,297,809 “Ammonia Control in a Recirculating Aquaculture System” covering all indoor aquatic species that utilizes proprietary art.
 
There are potential technical processes for which the Company may be able to file a patent. However, there are no assurances that such applications, if filed, would be issued and no right of enforcement is granted to a patent application. Therefore, the Company plans to use a variety of other methods, including copyright registrations as appropriate, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and non-compete agreements to protect its intellectual property portfolio.
 
Source and Availability of Raw Materials
 
Raw materials are received in a timely manner from established suppliers. Currently, we buy our feed from Zeigler, a leading producer of aquatic feed. Post larvae (“PL”) shrimp are available from Sea Products Development in Texas and Homegrown Shrimp in Florida.
 
There have not been any issues regarding the availability of our raw materials. We have favorable contacts and past business dealings with other major shrimp feed producers if current suppliers are not available.

Government Approvals and Regulations
 
We are subject to government regulation and require certain licenses. The following list includes regulations to which we are subject and/or the permits and licenses we currently hold:
 
● Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) (renewed annually) - “Exotic species permit” to raise exotic shrimp (non-native to Texas). The La Coste facility is north of the coastal shrimp exclusion zone (east and south of H-35, where it intersects Hwy 21 down to Laredo) and therefore outside of TPWD’s major area of concern for exotic shrimp. This license is currently active, expiring on December 31, 2022.
 
● Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) (renewed every two years) - “Aquaculture License” for aquaculture production facilities. License to “operate a fish farm or cultured fish processing plant.” This license is currently active, expiring on June 30, 2022. We do not intend to renew this license since it will not be needed in the future.
 
● Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) (renewed annually) - Regulates facility wastewater discharge. According to the TCEQ permit classification system, we are rated Level 1 – Recirculation system with no discharge. This license is currently active, with no set expiration date.
 
We are subject to certain regulations regarding the need for field employees to be certified. We strictly adhere to these regulations. The cost of certification is an accepted part of expenses. Regulations may change and become a cost burden, but compliance and safety are our main concern.
 
Market Advantages and Corporate Drivers
 
The following are what we consider to be our advantages in the marketplace:
 
● Early-mover Advantage: We believe we have an early-mover advantage via commercialized platform technologies in a large growing market with no significant competition yet identified. Most are early-stage start-ups or early-stage companies with limited production and distribution.
 
● Farm-to-Market: This has significant advantages including reduced transportation costs and a product that is more attractive to local consumers.
 
● Bio-secured Building: Our process is a re-circulating, highly-filtered water technology in an indoor-regulated environment. External pathogens are excluded.
 
● Eco-friendly Technology: Our closed-loop, re-circulating system has no ocean water exchange requirements, does not use chemical or antibiotics and therefore is sustainable, eco-friendly, environmentally sound and produces a superior quality shrimp that is totally natural.
 
● Availability of Weekly Fresh Shrimp: Assures consumers of optimal freshness, taste, and texture of product which will command premium prices.
 
● Sustainability: Our naturally grown product does not deplete wild supplies, has no by-catch kill of marine life, does not damage sensitive ecological environments, and avoids potential risks of imported seafood.
 
Subsidiaries
 
The Company has three wholly-owned subsidiaries including NSC, NS Global and NAS.
 
Human Capital Management
 
We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. In particular, we depend on the skills, experience, and performance of our senior management and engineering and technical personnel. We compete for qualified personnel with other industry experts.
 
We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region and employment classification) include incentive compensation plan, pension, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, family leave, and on-site services, among others. We also use targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly for our key employees.

The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health and safety of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
 
Environmental, Social, and Governance Efforts

Employees
 
As of March 31, 2022, we had 25   full-time employees. We intend to hire additional staff and to engage consultants in general administration on an as-needed basis. We also may engage experts in general business to advise us in various capacities. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
