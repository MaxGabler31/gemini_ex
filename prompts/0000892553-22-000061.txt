Cryo Tank Solutions
Cryo Tank Solutions (34% of consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2021) designs and manufactures cryogenic solutions for the storage and delivery of cryogenic liquids used in industrial gas and LNG applications. With operations in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia, our Cryo Tank Solutions segment serves customers globally.
Industrial Gas Applications
We design and manufacture bulk and packaged gas cryogenic solutions for the storage, distribution, vaporization, and application of industrial gases. Our products span the entire spectrum of industrial gas demand from small customers requiring cryogenic packaged gases to large users requiring custom engineered cryogenic storage systems in both mobile and stationary applications. Using sophisticated vacuum insulation technology, our cryogenic storage systems are able to store and transport liquefied industrial gases and hydrocarbon gases at temperatures from 0° Fahrenheit to temperatures nearing absolute zero. Industrial gas applications include any end-use of the major elements of air (nitrogen, oxygen, and argon), including manufacturing, welding, electronics and medical. Principal customers for industrial applications are global industrial gas producers and distributors. Other end-users of our equipment include chemical producers, manufacturers of electrical components, health care organizations and companies in the oil and natural gas industries.
Demand for industrial gas applications is driven primarily by the significant installed base of users of cryogenic liquids, as well as new applications and distribution technologies for cryogenic liquids. Our competitors tend to be regionally focused while we supply a broad range of systems on a worldwide basis. We also compete with several suppliers owned by the global industrial gas producers. From a technology perspective, we compete with compressed gas alternatives or on-site generated gas supply.
LNG Applications
We supply cryogenic solutions for the storage, distribution, regasification, and use of LNG. LNG may be utilized as an alternative to other fossil fuels such as diesel, propane, or fuel oil in transportation or off pipeline applications. Examples include heavy duty truck and transit bus transportation, locomotive propulsion, marine, and power generation in remote areas. We refer to our LNG distribution products as a “Virtual Pipeline,” as the traditional natural gas pipeline is replaced with cryogenic distribution to deliver the gas to the end-user. We supply cryogenic trailers, ISO containers, bulk storage tanks, loading facilities, and regasification equipment specially configured for delivering LNG into Virtual Pipeline applications. We sell LNG applications around the world from various Eastern and Western Hemisphere facilities to numerous end-users, energy companies, and gas distributors. Additionally, we supply large vacuum insulated storage tanks as equipment for purchasers of standard liquefaction plants sold by our Heat Transfer Systems segment.
Demand for LNG applications is driven by diesel displacement initiatives, environmental and energy security considerations, and the associated cost of equipment. Our competitors tend to be regionally focused or product-specific, while we supply a broad range of solutions required by LNG applications.
Heat Transfer Systems
Heat Transfer Systems (20% of consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2021) facilitates major natural gas, petrochemical processing, petroleum refining, power generation and industrial gas companies in the production or processing of their products. With primary manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and Europe, Heat Transfer Systems serves customers globally. This segment supplies mission critical engineered equipment and technology-driven process systems used in the separation, liquefaction, and purification of hydrocarbon and industrial gases that span most gas-to-liquid applications.
Natural Gas Processing (including Petrochemical) Applications
We provide natural gas processing solutions that facilitate the progressive cooling and liquefaction of hydrocarbon mixtures for the subsequent recovery or purification of component gases. Primary products used in these applications include brazed aluminum heat exchangers, cold boxes, pressure vessels, Core-in-Kettle® and air cooled heat exchangers. Our brazed aluminum heat exchangers allow producers to obtain purified hydrocarbon by-products, such as methane, ethane, propane, and ethylene, which are commercially marketable for various industrial or residential uses. Our cold boxes are highly engineered systems that incorporate brazed aluminum heat exchangers, pressure vessels, and interconnecting piping used to significantly reduce the temperature of gas mixtures to liquefy component gases so that they can be separated and purified for further use in multiple energy, industrial, scientific, and commercial applications. Chart’s air cooled heat exchangers are used to cool or condense fluids to allow for further processing and for cooling gas compression equipment. Our process technology includes standard and modular plant solutions and comprises detailed mechanical design, Chart manufactured proprietary equipment and all other plant items required to liquefy pipeline quality natural gas. Customers for our natural gas processing applications 
include large companies in the hydrocarbon processing industry, as well as engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) contractors.
Demand for these applications is primarily driven by the growth in the natural gas liquids (or NGLs) separation and other natural gas segments of the hydrocarbon processing industries, including LNG. In the future, management believes that continuing efforts by petroleum producing countries to better utilize stranded natural gas and associated gases which historically had been flared, present a promising source of demand. We have several competitors for our heat exchangers and fans, including certain leading companies in the industrial gas and hydrocarbon processing industries as well as many smaller fabrication-only facilities around the world. Competition with respect to our more specialized brazed aluminum heat exchangers includes a small number of global (European and Asian) manufacturers.
LNG Applications
We provide process technology, liquefaction train, and independent mission critical equipment for the liquefaction of natural gas (LNG), including small to mid-scale facilities, floating LNG applications, and large base-load export facilities. We are a leading supplier to EPC firms where we provide equipment and process technology, providing an integrated and optimized approach to the project. These “Concept-to-Reality” process systems incorporate many of Chart’s core products, including brazed aluminum heat exchangers, Core-in-Kettle® heat exchangers, cold boxes, air cooled heat exchangers, pressure vessels, and pipe work. These systems are used in global LNG projects, for both local LNG production as well as LNG export terminals. Our proprietary IPSMR® (Integrated Pre-cooled Single Mixed Refrigerant) and IPSMR+® liquefaction process technology offers lower capital expenditure requirements than competing processes measured on a per ton of LNG produced basis, along with very competitive operating costs.
Demand for LNG applications is primarily driven by increased use and global trade in natural gas (transported as LNG) since natural gas offers significant cost and environmental advantages over other fossil fuels. Demand for LNG for fuel applications is also driven by diesel displacement and continuing efforts by petroleum producing countries to better utilize stranded natural gas and previously flared gases. We have several competitors for these applications, including leading industrial gas companies, other brazed aluminum heat exchanger manufacturers, and other equipment fabricators to whom we also act as a supplier of equipment, including heat exchangers and cold boxes.
HVAC, Power and Refining Applications
Our air cooled heat exchangers and axial cooling fans are used in HVAC, power and refining applications. Demand for HVAC is driven by growing construction activities and demand for energy efficient devices, and there is also positive impact from growing industrial production. Refining demand continues to be driven by United States shale production, benefiting from low cost shale oil and gas resulting in high utilization and increased investment. Our air cooled heat exchangers are used in each phase of the refining process to condense and cool fluids. Worldwide power use is projected to grow 50% through 2050. This growth is focused in regions where strong economic growth is driving demand, particularly in Asia.
Specialty Products 
Specialty Products (33% of consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2021) supplies highly-engineered equipment used in specialty end-market applications for hydrogen, LNG, biofuels, CO2 Capture, food and beverage, aerospace, lasers, cannabis and water treatment, among others. Leveraging our global manufacturing presence Specialty Products serves customers globally. During 2021 and 2020, we made a number of acquisitions to capitalize on clean power, clean industrials, clean water and clean food, beverages and agriculture market opportunities within this segment. These include the acquisitions of BlueInGreen, LLC, Sustainable Energy Solutions, Inc., Cryogenic Gas Technologies, Inc., L.A. Turbine, AdEdge Holdings, LLC and Earthly Labs Inc.
We supply a wide range of solutions used in the production, storage, distribution and end-use of hydrogen while also providing highly-specialized mobility and transportation equipment for use with both hydrogen and LNG, including onboard vehicle tanks and fueling stations. More specifically, our horizontal LNG vehicle tanks are widely used onboard heavy-duty trucks and buses while our recently-released liquid hydrogen vehicle tank enjoys many of the same characteristics. Chart also manufactures specialized cryogenic railcars used to transport not only LNG, but a number of other gaseous and liquid molecules. Additionally, we design and manufacture nitrogen dosing products and other equipment used in packaging as well as the food and beverage industry. These applications include processing, preservation and beverage carbonation.
Our water treatment technology is also offered through the Specialty Products segment. Serving both municipal and industrial end markets globally, our water treatment process technology utilizes Chart’s cryogenic storage and vaporization equipment to efficiently deliver dissolved oxygen, CO2 and ozone into water. Our technology is used for oxygenation, pH adjustment, oxidation and odor control with modular and mobile solution options. Additional water treatment capabilities 
include but are not limited to adsorption, filtration, ion exchange, reverse osmosis and flow reversal processes, to name a few. Our expanded solution set effectively addresses a wide range of organic and inorganic contaminants including arsenic and per- and polyfluorinated alkylated substances (PFAS), often referred to as “forever chemicals.” Other equipment and technology offered through Specialty Products have applications in CO2 Capture, space and cannabis industries. We also offer cryogenic components, including turboexpanders, vacuum insulated pipe (“VIP”), specialty liquid nitrogen, or LN2, end-use equipment and cryogenic flow meters.
We design and manufacture solutions for the liquefaction, storage, distribution, regasification and use of hydrogen. There are a number of commercial uses for hydrogen including traditional applications in the chemical, refining and space industries. More recently, hydrogen is increasingly being used as an alternative fuel for the power transportation sectors, with both onshore and marine applications. Given the global movement towards a lower carbon footprint, there are also a number of other potential uses for hydrogen on the horizon including power generation. To help enable this transition, we supply ISO containers and transport trailers for both gaseous and liquid hydrogen, in addition to fuel stations and other fueling solutions. We also manufacture various types of heat exchangers for hydrogen applications including brazed aluminum, air-cooled and shell & tube varieties.
Demand for many of our specialty applications including hydrogen is primarily driven by the global, public and private sector movement towards a lower-carbon footprint, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and overall sustainability trends. These efforts are being guided not only by government policies and related global climate goals, but also by social and environmental actions by various stakeholders. Management believes hydrogen in particular will play an ever-increasing role in the energy transition, given its zero emission characteristics and naturally abundant supply. Similarly, management believes other equipment offered by Chart’s Specialty Products segment will be required to achieve global greenhouse gas reduction targets and other environmental-related goals, including our carbon capture and biofuel technology, water treatment offerings and specialty packaging equipment. Demand for LNG is also likely to continue benefiting from the ongoing energy transition given its environmental advantages over other fossil fuels. While we have competitors in a portion of these applications, many of our specialty product markets have limited competition.

Our sales to particular customers fluctuate from period to period, but the global producers and distributors of hydrocarbon and industrial gases as well as their suppliers tend to be a consistently large source of revenue for us. Our supply contracts are generally contracts for “requirements” only. While our customers may be obligated to purchase a certain percentage of their supplies from us, there are generally no minimum requirements. Also, many of our contracts may be canceled at any time, subject to possible cancellation charges. To minimize credit risk from trade receivables, we review the financial condition of potential customers in relation to established credit requirements before sales credit is extended and we monitor the financial condition of customers to help ensure timely collections and to minimize losses. In addition, for certain domestic and foreign customers, we require advance payments, letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, and other such guarantees of payment. Certain customers also require us to issue letters of credit or performance bonds, particularly in instances where advance payments are involved, as a condition to placing the order. We believe our relationships with our customers are generally good.
Intellectual Property
Although we have a number of patents, trademarks, and licenses related to our business, no one of them or related group of them is considered by us to be of such importance that its expiration or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business. In general, we depend upon technological capabilities, manufacturing quality control, and application of know-how, rather than patents or other proprietary rights, in the conduct of our business.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
We manufacture most of the products we sell. The raw materials used in manufacturing include aluminum products (including sheets, bars, plate, and piping), stainless steel products (including sheets, plates, heads, and piping), palladium oxide, carbon steel products (including sheets, plates, and heads), valves and gauges, and fabricated metal components. Most raw materials are available from multiple sources of supply, although shortages and delays to certain materials have been experienced during the past year, as a result of market disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. We have long-term relationships with our raw material suppliers and other vendors. Commodity components of our raw material (aluminum, stainless steel and carbon steel) could experience additional levels of volatility during 2022 and may have a relational impact on raw material pricing. Subject to certain short-term risks related to our suppliers as discussed under Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” we foresee no acute shortages of any raw materials that would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Human Capital Resources

In addition, employees have a duty to report violations and have multiple avenues available through which inappropriate behavior can be reported, such as supervisors, managers, ethics representatives or the confidential, anonymous Chart Ethics Hotline. Designated ethics representatives are always available for employees who have questions or need guidance on compliance. All reports of inappropriate behavior are promptly investigated with appropriate action taken to stop such behavior. Chart investigates alleged incidents and communicates the resolution to the person who reported it. We prohibit retaliation and threats of retaliation against anyone who reports a possible violation or misconduct in good faith and protect employees with our Whistleblower Policy. Chart has partnered with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to drive a more diverse and inclusive workforce. Our Chief Executive Officer and President, Jillian Evanko, has also signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion™ pledge, and our Global Diversity & Inclusion Committee is working with our 4,771 team members to ensure all of our key themes and priorities work seamlessly together in our culture for the best employee experience.
Environmental Matters
Our operations have historically included and currently include the handling and use of hazardous and other regulated substances, such as various cleaning fluids used to remove grease from metal, that are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These regulations impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the soil, air, and water and establish standards for their handling, management, use, storage, and disposal. We monitor and review our procedures and policies for compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Our management is familiar with these regulations and supports an ongoing program to maintain our adherence to required standards.
We are involved with environmental compliance, investigation, monitoring, and remediation activities at certain of our owned or formerly owned manufacturing facilities and at one owned facility that is leased to a third party. We believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all known environmental regulations. We accrue for certain environmental remediation-related activities for which commitments or remediation plans have been developed or for which costs can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are determined based upon currently available facts regarding each facility. Actual costs incurred may vary from these estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved. Future expenditures relating to these environmental remediation efforts are expected to be made over the coming years as ongoing costs of remediation programs. We do not believe that these regulatory requirements have had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or 
competitive position. We are not anticipating any material capital expenditures in 2022 that are directly related to regulatory compliance matters. Although we believe we have adequately provided for the cost of all known environmental conditions, additional contamination, the outcome of disputed matters, or changes in regulatory posture could result in more costly remediation measures than budgeted, or those we believe are adequate or required by existing law. We believe that any additional liability in excess of amounts accrued which may result from the resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, cash flows, or results of operations.
