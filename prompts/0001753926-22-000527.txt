Overview of the Market
 
The cannabis market has a multi-billion dollar potential. The industry is still in a development stage, and is being rapidly propelled towards its potential by the state legalization and the rush by suppliers to meet the pent-up demand. Most suppliers are small, unsophisticated but capable operators. The federal legal constraints provide an opportunity to those companies early to the market to gain a first mover advantage and to the successful ones, an opportunity to be a consolidator in the industry.
 
What is Diego’s Strategy, Phases One and Two?
 
Diego is a real estate and a consumer retail development company that is focused on high quality recurring revenues resulting from leasing real estate to licensed cannabis operators, and the management of operations for these and other third party cannabis operators deriving income from management and royalty fees. Diego provides a competitive advantage to these operators by developing “Diego Pellicer” as the world’s first premium marijuana brand and by establishing the highest quality standards for its facilities and products.
 
The Company’s first phase strategy is to lease and develop the most prominent and convenient real estate locations for the purposes of leasing them to state licensed operators in the cannabis industry. Diego’s first phase revenues result from leasing real estate and selling non-cannabis related accessories to our tenants. The Company has developed a brand name strategy, providing training, design services, branded accessories, systems and systems training, locational selection, and other advisory services to their tenants. We enter into branding agreements with our tenants. In addition, part of the vetting process in finding the proper tenant is selecting a tenant that shares the Company’s values and strictly complies with respective state laws, follows strict safety and testing requirements and provides consistent, high-quality products. If the tenants do not comply, they will not be allowed to use the brand.
 
The second phase of our strategy is to secure options to purchase the tenant’s operations. When mutually advantageous for Diego and the tenant, Diego will negotiate acquisition contracts with selected Diego operators/tenants. When it becomes federally legal to do so, Diego will execute the acquisition contracts, consolidate our selected tenants and become a nationally branded marijuana retailer and producer concurrent with the change of federal law.
 
Diego Pellicer Management Company, a wholly owned subsidiary, will license the upscale Diego Pellicer (“DP”) brand to qualified operators and receive royalty payments, while providing expertise in retail, product and manufacturing from Diego’s management team.
 
Value Proposition
 
Value Proposition 1:
 
By providing branding, management experience, training, unique accessories, purchasing services, locational experience, standardized design, and experienced construction supervision, the tenant reduces his startup time, reduces cash drain, increases his efficiency, and builds his gross margin. Diego provides the capital for preopening lease costs and tenant improvements. This results in a turnkey retail location for the tenant. Thus, Diego’s real estate, management, consulting and accessory sales are positioned to deliver a premium return on our investment.
Value Proposition 2:
 
With each lease, Diego negotiates an acquisition contract with selected licensed tenants to acquire their operations. This contract will be executed at Diego’s option, and upon changes to federal law, introduces our second value proposition-ownership of operations.
Revenue Generation and Growth
 
Diego generates current revenue and stages future revenue streams through the following processes:
 

● | Acquire target properties to be improved for the growing, processing, distribution, and sale of medical and recreational marijuana, extracts and ancillary products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Build and lease turnkey Retail, Processing and/or Growing facilities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company may choose to secure management contracts with other retail and grow facilities to manage the business the “Diego Way.” This will generate additional revenue with which we can further expand our network of stores. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Negotiate merger agreements with favored partners that will trigger when marijuana commerce becomes legal federally. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Own DP Brands and other intellectual property. 
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Charge reasonable rents and management fees to tenants or operators to recover all build-out, start-up investment plus profit margin, and management expertise over the lease term. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
3

 


● | Sell non-cannabis branded products lines such as apparel and edibles to Diego stores, other retail stores and for wholesale. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Create an e-commerce platform selling non-cannabis branded merchandise 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to build and market the brand utilizing all forms of media including traditional and digital media, social media, e-commerce, and strategic partners. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why We Believe this is a Winning Strategy
 
Should the United States and countries around the world legalize the commerce of marijuana, Diego is positioning itself to be a dominate player in the marijuana marketplace. Diego will accomplish this by being a fully integrated marijuana retail operation and premium brand, capitalizing on the beautifully designed retail stores offering the finest quality products at competitive prices.
 
Most industries evolve through the same business cycle. Many small independent companies initially operate in fragmented markets in the early stages. Then there is a consolidation of the industry, with the consolidators thriving and the independent companies dwindling. The larger companies have access to cheaper capital, lower costs, better merchandising, brand name recognition, and more efficient operations. This is what we offer our tenants when negotiating the lease: an agreement to acquire them when marijuana is legalized. This gives the tenant the ultimate opportunity to participate in the rapid consolidation that we believe will happen when marijuana is legalized. This consolidation will result in companies that have been unable to participate in the rapidly growing industry to be scrambling to enter the space. Diego and its tenants will already be established and consolidated. As an exit strategy, we want to position Diego to be a likely candidate for acquisition or a major player in the marketplace.
 
Recent Developments
 
2021 was a time of continued growth and a change of focus for the Company. An effective and experienced team was assembled from within our operators to develop our management company, and to complement the current executives with knowledge and experience in real estate operations, banking, site selection, branding, marketing, facility design, corporate finance, investor relations, store management, and grow expertise, Additional capital needed to be raised in order to have sufficient capital to help support our operators expand within their markets, and to begin the expansion into different markets in the US. Much of the Company’s debt is being renegotiated, and additional commitments were formalized for the expansion in the Colorado market. New markets had to be explored, new alliances forged, and opportunities prioritized.
 
New markets were explored. Three facilities continued to see solid revenues, which lead to rental revenue cash-flow to the Company. In 2021, Diego focused on our Colorado operations in Denver. Diego received revenues from the Colorado facilities and received revenues from a divested leased property in 2020. Diego now has two facilities generating rent in 2021 and we have actively been expanding in the Colorado markets with potential acquisitions for our tenants, and our management company. Although our tenants continue to strengthen their presence in the marketplace, post COVID-19 sales have tapered off slightly as the general workforce returns to work. Diego worked with these tenants, partially forbearing on their rent so as to allow these operators to strengthen their position and become capable of paying full rents. The properties generating rents in 2021 are as follows:
 
Table 1: Property Portfolio
 

Purpose | Size | City | State
--------------------------------------------+----------------+--------+------
Retail store (recreational and medical) | 3,300 sq. | Denver | CO 
Cultivation warehouse | 14,800 sq. | Denver | CO 

 
Diego’s Denver Colorado tenant opened our first grow store in Seattle in October 2016. On October 21 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party, to which the Company sold the Elizabeth Street leased location operation securing all the future premium rents due under the extended lease agreement The Colorado tenant opened the Diego Denver branded grow facility in February 2017. The retail facilities have shown steady growth in sales since their opening. The three Colorado properties were subleased to a single entity. The Company is currently exploring the acquisition of other entities to increase cash flow and value for the company.

Diego Pellicer Denver
 

Diego will continue this strategy in states where recreational or medical marijuana sales and cultivation is legal under state law. Our business model is recurring lease revenue, royalties, management fees, and is entirely scalable. Our success will dependent upon continuing to raise capital for expansion, continual improvement of our business model, standardizing store design, controlling costs, new store management opportunities, and continuing to develop the brand.
 
On February 8, 2022, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), with Hemp Choice Distribution, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“HCD”), its owners (the “Sellers”), and Gabriela Vergara (the “Sellers’ Representative”), pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of HCD (“Membership Interests”). The closing of the transaction is expected to occur within 90 days from the date of the Purchase Agreement (the “Closing”).
 
The purchase price for the Membership Interests shall be the aggregate amount of $4,400,000 payable at the Closing as follows: (i) $250,000 in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds; (ii) the number of restricted shares of the Company’s common stock that is equal to $250,000 divided by the current market price at the time of Closing, but such price shall not be greater than $.05 per share or less than $.02 per share: and (iii) three million nine hundred thousand dollars ($3,900,000) in the form of 390,000 shares of redeemable preferred stock (with a stated value of $10.00 per share) of the Company. The terms of the redeemable preferred shares shall be specifically and fully set forth in a Certificate of Designations to be filed with the State of Delaware at the time of Closing. After the Closing, the Purchaser agrees to provide HCD with a line of credit or assist it in obtaining a line of credit from a third party of up to $1,000,000. In addition, the business of HCD shall continue to be managed by Sellers’ Representative subject to the conditions of an employment agreement to be entered into by the Company and Sellers’ Representative prior to the Closing.


What does our premium branding accomplish?
 
A very important aspect of our marketing plan is to build Diego Pellicer as a luxury brand. This not only enables us to establish a premium brand, but also to generate significant revenues from non- cannabis products.

The Company is establishing several levels of branding and will use these to appeal to the various segments of the marketplace depending upon the location, competition, legal constraints, and budget. Standard store templates are being developed, complimentary accessories selectively designed, and customer preferences and segments analyzed.
 
Our Denver stores have been met with enthusiastic demand and quickly growing revenues. This is proving the initial Diego concept.

The Industry: Retail Sales Continue to Rise 
 
Legalization of marijuana is a very recent movement. California was the first to legalize in 1996 when medical marijuana was approved. Eleven states and the District of Columbia have legalized the drug for recreational purposes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. More than half the states (36) – plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico – have legalized it for medical purposes. The list of states that have legalized marijuana could expand this November. Marijuana remains illegal under U.S. federal law.

The growth in public support for legal marijuana and hemp derived CBD comes as a growing number of states have legalized the drug for medical or recreational purposes in recent years.
 
About 7-in-10 Americans (74%) say the use of marijuana should be legalized, reflecting a steady increase over the past decade, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. The share of U.S. adults who support marijuana legalization has changed from about 2 years ago – when 62% favored it – but it is more than double what it was in 2000 (31%).
 
As in the past, there are wide generational and partisan differences in views of marijuana legalization. Majorities of Millennials (74%), Gen Xers (63%) and Baby Boomers (54%) say the use of marijuana should be legal. Members of the Silent Generation continue to be the least supportive of legalization (39%), but they have become more supportive in the past year.

Annual cannabis retail sales continue to grow year-over-year as new markets emerge and more states legalize medical and recreational marijuana. Sales in 2024 are projected to increase to over $30 billion
 
By 2024, annual retail marijuana sales in the United States could top $40 billion, which would represent more than a 30% increase from 2019.

The retail and medical marijuana industry brought in an estimated $59.2 - $70 billion of economic impact in 2020 just in the USA. By 2025, we expect the potential for the industry to surpass $135 billion in annual economic benefit.
 
Estimates for economic impact are based on an impact multiplier of 3.5. This means that for every $1 consumers spend at dispensaries or recreational stores, another $2.50 in economic benefit will be created in the cities, states and ultimately the nation.
 
Here are some of the factors in this overall economic impact:
 
● | The launch of new businesses 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Hundreds of millions of dollars in state and local taxes 
● | Real estate investments 
● | Visiting tourists spending money to legally consume 
● | Marijuana employees circulating earnings back into the economy 

 
The marijuana labor market has increased about 38% over last year with marijuana industry supporting about 240,000-295,000 employees. A majority of this growth has come from other states legalizing marijuana use over the last few years including California, which is the next market Diego is focusing its attention on for acquisitions, and branding agreements. In 2019, marijuana employment surpassed that of the technology industry of web developers and is fast approaching the number of clergy in the USA.
 
The continued growth in the cannabis market, including legalizing the growing and retailing of hemp based products, has boosted the rapid growth in employees and retail sales. The industry is expected to add more than 430,000 full-time jobs between now and 2024 with compounding annual growth rates of 22% and should lead to over 575,000 jobs by 2024.

Outside of California, however, sales are expected to continue climbing, bolstered by ongoing growth in mature markets like New Mexico and Arizona, increased patient access in Florida and new Medical Marijuana (MMJ) programs coming online in Maryland and Pennsylvania. The transition to fully regulated, state-licensed MMJ sales in Michigan has caused some short-term instability, but it remains one of the largest medical markets in the country and will likely continue to form the foundation of the MMJ industry for years to come.
 
As more states continue to legalize medical and recreational marijuana sales, an ever increasing number of adults are introduced, or re-introduced to the product. Continued research into the benefits of Cannabidiol (CBD) derived from both the Marijuana and hemp plants, has catapulted the cannabis industry into the mainstream media. Legal sales of recreational and medical marijuana reached about $25.2 billion in sales for 2021, about half that spent on tobacco cigarettes. It is estimated that total demand for cannabis including legally produced product is in excess of $50 - $60 billion
 
By 2025, we project total retail and medical marijuana sales in the United States will reach approximately $38.4-45.9 billion annually - more than a threefold increase from estimated annual sales in 2017. Our estimates account for the fact that more states will likely legalize medical or adult-use marijuana in the coming years - though it’s difficult to predict when that will happen and how big those markets will be. Using a range of estimates that incorporate several factors - such as the likelihood of a given state passing a legalization measure, the size of the customer/patient base and time frame for the launch of sales - helps account for this uncertainty. Our approach is refined over time as more information becomes available.
 
It’s important to point out that the marijuana industry has a big and growing impact on the economy at large as the revenue it generates ripples across a community, city and/ or state - as well as the nation. To understand an industry’s economic impact, traditional macroeconomic multipliers can range anywhere from 10 to 20 times the original dollar spent. Based on new data from other industries, we’ve settled on a standard multiplier of 3.5 for the marijuana industry - a slight revision from last year’s multiplier of four.
 
In other words, for every $1 consumers/patients spend at dispensaries and rec stores, an additional $2.50 of economic value will be injected into the economy - much of it at the local level.

(Note that our goal is to provide conservative, realistic financial forecasts that reflect the high degree of uncertainty in the industry. Total cannabis sales in any given calendar year are highly dependent upon progress made - or not made - in each individual state. California is currently the big wild card, as the slow rollout of its statewide regulatory system makes it difficult to get a handle on the exact size of this enormous market. As more information comes to light over time, it could change our estimates for California and, therefore, the industry at large.)
 
Where are the Greatest Market Opportunities?
 
All eyes are on California.
 
That’s the reality for nearly everyone involved in the global marijuana market. Companies around the world - from Europe to Canada to Israel and beyond - want a piece of the California market. But there are plenty of practical ramifications. No other state or federal government in the world has tried to implement such a wide-ranging regulatory system that affects tens of thousands of existing black- and gray-market businesses.
 
The bottom line: The sheer immensity of the California cannabis market is topped only by its complexity. And that complexity has led to major struggles and big wait times for entrepreneurs looking to tap the California market potential. California’s Marijuana (MJ) regulatory system covers a population of 40 million and includes incentives for existing businesses to transition to the licit tax-paying industry.
 
There are plenty of other hurdles for existing and future businesses as well, including local license caps from towns and counties that are hesitant to grant permits to any type of cannabis companies. As of early October 2018, only a fraction of local governments had opted to allow recreational use companies to set up shop within their borders, and state business permits are dependent on a company first obtaining local authorization of some sort. Plenty of companies are striving to play by the rules, but they’re often unable to stay in business while doing so because they haven’t been able to find locations that fit all the legal parameters for licensing.
 
The same is true for thousands of small-scale growers in California, as well as edibles makers, concentrate producers and other plant-touching businesses. One option for such companies, at least for now, is to focus on the medical marijuana market instead of recreational. Far more local governments allow limited medical companies than adult-use businesses. Obtaining such permits could be a stopgap move because, as time goes on, it’s likely that more and more local governments will decide to permit recreational use. Another option could be to pivot into an alternate cannabis sector, such as distribution or testing labs, given that there’s a dearth of both key business types in the state.
 
Hemp and CBD
 
Hemp was once prized for making rope. Two hundred years later, the plant still has us tied in knots. From a patchwork of state hemp rules to confusion among cannabis entrepreneurs about the definition of hemp, uncertainty reigns in the hemp industry. Hemp has long been bedeviled by its conflation with marijuana, and the Controlled Substances Act banned its production for decades. That changed in 2014, when the U.S. Farm Bill opened the door for a hemp revival in states willing to experiment (and control) the crop’s return to legal production. The federal government defines hemp as cannabis sativa with a THC content at or below 0.3%.
 
The Farm Bill set off an explosion of hemp production and experimentation and has given cannabis entrepreneurs new opportunities to grow, sell and buy cannabis in a nonintoxicating form. The Farm Bill allows limited interstate commerce for hemp - something still off-limits to marijuana entrepreneurs. Hemp businesses report fewer banking and regulatory headaches.
 
The U.S. hemp experiment is still unfolding. Market conditions vary widely. Though the laws vary from state to state, it is more or less legal to produce hemp in most American states. America is finally getting its staple agriculture back. This can greatly benefit America as it will revolutionize several of its key industries – textiles, biomass, natural gas, building materials among others.

Not all U.S. states use the federal THC guidelines to define hemp, and the 0.3% THC threshold has little basis in science, meaning that scientists don’t agree about how much THC a plant needs to produce a high when heated and consumed. Cannabis plants have more than 100 cannabinoids, of which THC is only one, and hemp products with no detectable THC can still be considered psychoactive if they contain cannabinoids that relieve anxiety or depression. At least one state, Iowa, explicitly dictates that cannabidiol is legal but high THC marijuana is not legal - then goes on to say it accepts cannabidiol with a THC limit 10 times higher than the federal threshold for legal hemp.
 
Still, the 0.3% THC threshold is a useful metric for dividing marijuana from hemp, and it is the standard used in the industry.
 
Longtime hemp prohibition in the United States has left the industry frozen in time. There is little modern agricultural equipment appropriate for hemp harvesting and processing, and the crop likely won’t match the market share it enjoyed before the Industrial Revolution, when hemp fibers were commonly used in commercial fabrics. Today, hemp’s value comes mostly from its flower, rich in cannabinoids beyond THC. The most valuable as of this report is CBD, a cannabinoid with established therapeutic uses including pain relief and reducing muscle spasms associated with epilepsy or muscular sclerosis.
 
Hemp Industry Daily estimates that the U.S. market for hemp-derived CBD will hit approximately $4.7 billion in 2021, with the potential to eclipse $6 billion annually by 2024 - a substantial increase in just a few years.
 
Expect hemp-derived cannabinoid products low in THC to take increasing market share (and media attention) in the overall cannabis industry.

Status of Federal Law
 
While marijuana is legal under the laws of several U.S. States, at the present time the concept of “medical marijuana” and “retail marijuana” do not exist under U.S. federal law. The United States Federal Controlled Substance Act classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug. As defined under U.S. federal law, a Schedule I drug or substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of safety for the use of the drug under medical supervision.
 
The United States Supreme Court has ruled in several cases that the federal government does not violate the federal constitution by regulating and criminalizing cannabis, even for medical purposes. Therefore, federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana pre-empts state laws that legalizes its use for medicinal and recreational purposes.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ January 2018 decision to rescind the Cole Memo raised some concerns in the marijuana industry that federal officials may try to interfere with legal cannabis. Those concerns, for the most part, haven’t materialized, but the scare did get many marijuana businesses thinking about the possibility of federal interference and what could be done about it.
 
The memo was drafted during the Obama administration by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole in 2013 as a way to minimize the threat of federal crackdowns against legal marijuana businesses. The document essentially instructed federal law enforcement not to interfere with state-licensed marijuana businesses complying with state laws and certain conditions, such as not selling product to minors or into the black market.
 
While the Cole Memo clearly expressed an Obama administration policy of leaving legal marijuana businesses alone, it was not a legal change - which only Congress can do. Therefore, the Cole Memo technically allowed U.S. attorneys to go after marijuana businesses if they wanted. With the sending of the Cole Memo to the proverbial shredder, U.S. attorneys no longer have guidelines on how to deal with state-licensed marijuana businesses. But in an April 2018 conversation with Republican U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, President Donald Trump pledged to keep the Department of Justice from interfering with state cannabis laws and, perhaps more significantly, support legislation protecting state-legal marijuana businesses. White House officials later confirmed the president’s policy stance.
 
As the Biden administration continues to dive deeper into its policy agenda, cannabis is a topic to watch. Though the administration has been focused on tackling immediate priorities, marijuana is likely to rise to the surface in the near term.
 
Several bills have been introduced to Congress seeking to reform federal marijuana laws in different ways, including the removal of cannabis from the list of controlled substances, allowing MJ companies to access traditional banking services and amending the IRS code to more fairly tax cannabis businesses. Similar bills have been introduced in previous sessions of Congress, but none have gained significant traction. This time, however, may be different, as marijuana reform has become a bipartisan issue that has the support of many prominent Democrats and Republicans.
 
The Current Landscape
 
President Biden’s views on marijuana legalization—as well as the Democratic Party’s—have evolved over time, as reflected in the 2020 Democratic Party Platform. In it, the party stated it would “decriminalize marijuana use and reschedule it through executive action on the federal level. [It would] support legalization of medical marijuana, and believe[d] states should be able to make their own decisions about recreational use.” Medical marijuana is legal in 36 states and, since February 2021, when New Jersey passed its own legalization bill, recreational cannabis is legal in 15 states. Additionally, some states such as Mississippi, where recreational use is not legal, have agreed to lessen the penalties for possession, while other states like Illinois are expunging arrests related to marijuana possession. New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo has signed legislation (S.854-A/A.1248-A) legalizing adult-use cannabis, fulfilling a key component of his 2021 State of the State agenda
 
With Democrats controlling Congress and the White House, and with the cannabis industry growing ever larger, many expect Congress to soon take up the issue of cannabis in earnest. “Ending the federal marijuana prohibition is necessary to right the wrongs of this failed [War on Drugs] and end decades of harm inflicted on communities of color across the country,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), along with Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), in a February 2021 joint statement.
 
Bipartisan support is swelling. A December 2020 poll found that two-thirds of all Americans, including 51 percent of Republicans, supported a December 2020 bill to federally legalize marijuana. Although the House omitted marijuana legalization in its most recent COVID relief bill, there are three marijuana-related pieces of major legislation that could pass during this congressional term:
 
The SAFE Banking Act, which provides a path for the financial system with respect to cannabis. The MORE Act, which addresses some of the societal injustices created by the War on Drugs. The STATES Act, which protects individuals who comply with state laws regulating marijuana.  All three bills are expected to be re-addressed during this congressional term.
 
The Biden administration has yet to formally weigh in on or issue an executive order concerning marijuana reform. However, when asked at his confirmation hearing if he thought 2014 Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidance should be updated to “set expectation for financial institutions that provide services to cannabis-related industries” and what steps he would take, Deputy Secretary of Treasury nominee Adewale Adeyamo said that he planned to address the issue if confirmed.
 
What This Means for Business
 
Organizations of all types should be mindful of the current landscape as it relates to cannabis, given the impact the pending legislation will have on law and rulemaking in the workplace. However, two sectors should pay particularly close attention to action in this space: the investment community and the financial services industry.
Investment Community
 
Descheduling and decriminalizing marijuana, as well as legalizing it to any degree, would open a larger window of opportunity to list cannabis-related stocks on U.S. exchanges. While providing more legal oversight of the industry would offer the potential for more jobs and revenue by supplying incentive for more people and entities to dive into the industry, it would also open the door for fraud risk. New market entrants should be vetted, as the risk of counterfeit products is high. As they do when deciding to fund any new product or venture, investors should assess their safeguards and risk mitigation framework before diving in.
Financial Services Industry
 
Banks in particular have long had a complicated relationship with marijuana-related businesses (MRBs). For the most part, MRBs do not have access to the banking industry. They are unable to accept credit cards, deposit revenues, access loans, or write checks to meet payroll or pay taxes, which makes them vulnerable. However, until cannabis is federally legal, financial services will continue to be handled by local providers, such as credit unions, which presents both opportunities and risks. Since regulations vary from state to state, bringing on a MRB client is complex and does not always align with prescribed risk. However, as the $56 billion industry continues to grow, banks must continue to evaluate whether it makes financial sense to consider banking this contradictory industry.
 
13

 

Even if the current administration makes banking MRBs more feasible, financial institutions should still evaluate clients on a case-by-case basis, ensuring compliance is strong at the core. Banks will need to ensure that MRBs—like other high-risk clients—are equipped with the right technology, ample compliance staff training, and clear parameters on risks and red flags. As compliance teams increasingly find their mandates growing and their resources stagnating or shrinking, looking to outsourced financial crimes risk management solutions can also provide some reprieve and support for managing this risk.
 
Despite movement on the federal marijuana front, organizations of all types should be mindful that the law has not changed yet—and if change does occur at the federal level, consulting with legal counsel and third-party risk experts before engaging in any new sector or product remains advisable.
