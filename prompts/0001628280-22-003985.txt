Item 1. Business
General
Envestnet, through its subsidiaries, is transforming the way financial advice and insight are delivered. Our mission is to empower financial advisors and service providers with innovative technology, solutions and intelligence. Envestnet has been a leader in helping transform wealth management, working towards its goal of expanding a holistic financial wellness ecosystem so that our clients can deliver an intelligent financial life to their clients ("Intelligent Financial Life").
Over 108,000 advisors and more than 6,000 companies, including 18 of the 20 largest U.S. banks, 47 of the 50 largest wealth management and brokerage firms, over 500 of the largest registered investment advisers (“RIAs”) and hundreds of FinTech companies, leverage Envestnet technology and services that help drive better outcomes for enterprises, advisors and their clients.
Through a combination of platform enhancements, partnerships and acquisitions, Envestnet uniquely provides a financial network connecting technology, solutions and data, delivering better intelligence and enabling its customers to drive better outcomes. 
Envestnet, a Delaware corporation originally founded in 1999, serves clients from its headquarters based in Chicago, Illinois, as well as other locations throughout the United States, India and other international locations. 
Segments
Envestnet is organized around two primary, complementary business segments. Financial information about each business segment is contained in Part II, Item 8, “Note 19—Segment Information”. Our business segments are as follows:
•Envestnet Wealth Solutions – a leading provider of unified wealth management software and services to empower financial advisors and institutions to enable them to deliver an Intelligent Financial Life to their clients.
•Envestnet Data & Analytics – a leading data aggregation and data intelligence platform powering dynamic, cloud-based innovation for digital financial services.
Envestnet Wealth Solutions Segment
Envestnet Wealth Solutions empowers financial advisors at broker-dealers, banks and RIAs with the tools they require to deliver holistic wealth management to their end clients, enabling them to deliver an Intelligent Financial Life to their clients. In addition, the firm provides advisors with practice management support so that they can grow their practices and operate more efficiently. At the end of 2021, Envestnet Wealth Solutions’ platform assets grew to approximately $5.7 trillion in more than 17.5 million accounts overseen by more than 108,000 advisors. 
Services provided to advisors include: financial planning, risk assessment tools, investment strategies and solutions, asset allocation models, research, portfolio construction, proposal generation and paperwork preparation, model management and account rebalancing, account monitoring, customized fee billing, overlay services covering asset allocation, tax management and socially responsible investing, aggregated multi‑custodian performance reporting and communication tools, plus data analytics. We have access to a wide range of leading third‑party asset custodians.
We offer these solutions principally through the following product and service suites:
•Envestnet | Enterprise provides an end-to-end open architecture wealth management platform, through which advisors can construct portfolios for clients. It begins with aggregated household data which then leads to a financial plan, asset allocation, investment strategy, portfolio management, rebalancing and performance reporting. Advisors have access to over 22,000 investment products. Envestnet | Enterprise also offers data aggregation and reporting, data analytics and digital advice capabilities to customers.
•Envestnet | Tamarac™ provides leading trading, rebalancing, portfolio accounting, performance reporting and client relationship management software, principally to high‑end RIAs.
•Envestnet | MoneyGuide provides leading goals-based financial planning solutions to the financial services industry. The highly adaptable software helps financial advisors add significant value for their clients using best-in-class technology with enhanced integrations to generate financial plans.
•Envestnet | Retirement Solutions (“ERS”) offers a comprehensive suite of services for advisor-sold retirement plans. Leveraging integrated technology, ERS addresses the regulatory, data, and investment needs of retirement plans and delivers the information holistically.
•Envestnet | PMC®, or Portfolio Management Consultants (“PMC”) provides research and consulting services to assist advisors in creating investment solutions for their clients. These solutions include nearly 4,900 vetted third-party managed account products, multi-manager portfolios and fund strategist portfolios, as well as over 950 proprietary products, such as quantitative portfolios and fund strategist portfolios. PMC also offers portfolio overlay and tax optimization services.
As the tables below indicate, Envestnet Wealth Solutions has experienced steady and significant growth over the last several years. We believe this growth is attributable to secular trends in the wealth management industry, the uniqueness and comprehensiveness of our products, as well as acquisitions. Periodically clients choose to change the way they pay for our solution, whereby they switch from an asset-based pricing model to a subscription-based model.

Envestnet Data & Analytics Segment
Envestnet Data & Analytics is a leading data aggregation and data intelligence platform. As an artificial intelligence (“AI”) and data specialist, Envestnet Data & Analytics gathers, refines and aggregates a massive set of end-user permissioned transaction level data, and combines them with financial applications, reports, market research analysis, and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for its customers.
Approximately 1,600 financial institutions, financial technology innovators and financial advisory firms, including 15 of the 20 largest U.S. banks, subscribe to the Envestnet Data & Analytics platform to underpin personalized financial apps and services for approximately 32 million paid subscribers.
Envestnet Data & Analytics serves two main customer groups: financial institutions (“FI”) and financial technology innovators, which we refer to as Yodlee Interactive (“YI”) customers.
•The Financial Institutions group provides customers with secure access to open APIs, end-user facing applications powered by our platform and APIs (“FinApps”), and reports. Customers receive end user-permissioned transaction data elements that we aggregate and cleanse. Envestnet Data & Analytics also enables customers to develop their own applications through its open APIs, which deliver secure data, payments solutions, and other functionality. FinApps can be subscribed to individually or in combinations that include personal financial management, wealth management, credit card, payments and small-medium business solutions. They are targeted at the retail banking, wealth management, small business, credit card, lenders, and other financial services sectors. These FinApps help consumers and small businesses simplify and manage their finances, review their financial accounts, track their spending, calculate their net worth, and perform a variety of other activities. For example, Envestnet|Yodlee Expense and Income Analysis FinApp helps consumers track their spending.
•The Yodlee Interactive group enables customers to develop new applications and enhance existing solutions. These customers operate in a number of sub-vertical markets, including FinTech, wealth management, personal financial management, small business accounting, small business lending and authentication. They use the Envestnet|Yodlee platform to build solutions that leverage our open APIs and provide access to a large end user base. In addition to aggregated transaction-level account data elements, we provide YI customers with secure access to account aggregation, account verification, and enriched transaction data via our APIs. We play a critical role in transferring innovation from financial technology innovators to financial institutions. For example, YI customers use Envestnet|Yodlee applications to provide personalized financial management, planning and advisory services; e-commerce payment solutions; online accounting systems for small businesses; and other services.
Both FI and YI channels benefit customers by improving end-user satisfaction and retention, accelerating speed to market, creating technology savings and enhancing their data analytics solutions and market research capabilities. End users receive better access to their financial information and more control over their finances, leading to more informed and personalized decision making. For customers who are members of the developer community, Envestnet|Yodlee solutions provide access to critical data solutions, faster speed to market and enhanced distribution.
We believe that our brand recognition, innovative technology and intellectual property, large customer base, and unique data gathering and enrichment provide us with competitive advantages that have enabled us to grow.
Market Opportunity
The wealth management industry has experienced significant growth in terms of assets invested by retail investors in the past several years. According to the Federal Reserve, U.S. household financial assets totaled approximately $114 trillion as of September 30, 2021, representing a sizeable wealth management opportunity. According to Boston Consulting Group's Global Wealth Report 2021, total net wealth in North America is expected to grow by 4.4% annually between 2020 and 2025 to exceed $165 trillion. Based on data from Cerulli Associates, investable assets comprised an estimated 53% of overall U.S. household financial assets in 2020, advisor-directed assets totaled $25.7 trillion in 2020, and advisors had discretion over 58% of managed account assets as of September 30, 2021.
In the next 5-10 years, we believe the wealth management industry will continue to consolidate with fewer firms and fewer advisors managing more assets, making scale and operational efficiency increasingly important. This will require firms to integrate technology into all areas of their business. 
The following trends are impacting Envestnet’s business and creating a large and growing market opportunity for data, technology, and investment solutions and services like ours:
•Financial Wellness: Financial services firms, FinTech companies, and employers are placing increased emphasis on financial wellness. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for advice. That said, according to a survey from the Society of Human Resource Management and Morgan Stanley at Work, only 26% of human resource professionals state that, since the beginning of the pandemic, their employer has offered new benefits or amplified existing benefits to assist employees in managing their financial stress.
•Sharing of Data: Ecosystem collaboration, which is characterized by a seamless exchange of data and resources, is enabling financial services firms to augment their overall capabilities. Traditional financial services firms and FinTech firms have complementary strengths, so collaboration leads to benefits for each partner and the end client. The power of an ecosystem is that it brings together a diverse group of constituents—consumers, product manufacturers, technology providers, developers and advisors—to create a network where value can be created and distributed at scale.
•Ease of Access: As investors are demanding more integrated solutions across their financial lives combined with a simpler, more personal experience with which they interact with their technology providers, wealth management providers will need to prioritize making interactions easy, fast, comprehensive and safe as a positive client experience helps to retain current clients and attract new clients.
•Underserved Segments: Underserved segments present a growth opportunity to wealth management firms. According to estimates from Cerulli Associates, 65% of households in the U.S. have less than $100,000 in investable assets. Another 21% of households have between $100,000 and $500,000 in investable assets. Historically, these segments did not represent attractive target markets to broker-dealers and RIAs. With today’s technology, it is possible for wealth management firms to serve these segments, which constitute an estimated market opportunity that exceeds $8 trillion. 
Business Model
Envestnet’s business model lends itself to a high degree of recurring and predictable revenues. Envestnet provides asset-based, subscription-based and professional services on a business-to-business-to-consumer basis to financial services clients, whereby customers offer solutions based on our platform to their end users. On a business-to-business basis, we deliver an open platform to customers and third-party developers through an open API framework. We believe that a number of characteristics contribute to the success of our business model, including:
•Favorable trends with respect to growth in fee-based assets and need for advanced technology; 
•Recurring and resilient revenue base; and
•Strong customer retention.
Our revenues are generated in the following manners:
Asset-based Recurring Revenues
Asset-based recurring revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers continuous access to platform services through the Company’s uniquely customized platforms. These platform services include investment manager research, portfolio diagnostics, proposal generation, investment model management, rebalancing and trading, portfolio performance reporting and monitoring solutions, billing and back office and middle-office operations and administration and are made available to customers throughout the contractual term from the date the customized platform is launched. 
The asset-based fees the Company earns are generally based upon variable percentages of assets managed or administered on our platforms. The fee percentage varies based on the level and type of services the Company provides to its customers, as well as the values of existing customer accounts. The values of the customer accounts are affected by inflows or outflows of customer funds and market fluctuations.
For over 75% of our asset‑based fee arrangements, customers are billed at the beginning of each quarter based on the market value of customer assets on our wealth management platforms as of the end of the prior quarter, providing for a high degree of revenue visibility in the current quarter. Revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on changes in asset values, fee rates on those asset values and asset flows. 
Subscription-based Recurring Revenues
Subscription-based recurring revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers continuous access to the Company’s platform for wealth management and financial wellness. The subscription-based fees generally include fixed fees and or usage-based fees.
Subscription fees vary based on the scope of technology solutions and services being used, and are priced in a variety of constructs based on the size of the business, number of users or number of accounts, and in many cases can increase over time based on the growth of these factors.
Despite this potential variance, we believe that Envestnet’s subscription fees are also highly predictable because they are generally established in multi‑year contracts providing longer‑term visibility regarding that portion of total revenues.
Professional Services and Other
Envestnet also generates revenue from professional services for client onboarding, technology development and other project related work.
 Growth Strategy
Envestnet intends to increase revenue and profitability by pursuing the following strategies:
•Capture addressable market:
◦Enterprise clients in wealth management. We provide enterprise clients with customized, private‑labeled technology platforms that enable them to support their affiliated financial advisors with a broad range of investment solutions and services. 
◦Financial advisors that are working alone or as part of financial advisory firms. Our principal value proposition aimed at financial advisors working alone or as part of financial advisory firms is that our technology platforms allow them to compete effectively with financial advisors employed by large financial institutions. 
◦Financial institutions. We serve global banks through financial applications. Envestnet Data & Analytics Retail Banking solution is a set of innovative FinApps providing consumers with a clear picture and greater insight into their financial lives. It enables customers to consolidate all their financial account information in one place which allows customers to manage and meet their financial goals, which in turn leads to increased engagement.
◦Other financial technology providers. We work with a variety of firms who provide technology to the financial services industry. We provide FinApps, personal financial management tools and data aggregation capabilities to companies in online lending, e-commerce and payments, digital advice and wealth management and other web development firms.
•Modernize the digital engagement marketplace:
◦We have made significant investments in platform development in order to enhance and expand our technology platforms and expect these investments to continue in the future.
◦We expect to continue focusing our technology development efforts principally on adding features to increase our market competitiveness, enhancements to improve operating efficiency, address regulatory demands and reduce risk and client‑driven requests for new capabilities. 
•Open the platform:
◦As we connect with more firms and developers, our product offerings continue to expand and vitalize our environment, which we believe drives more benefit for our customers. 
We also continue to pursue strategic transactions and other relationships to support our growth strategies.
Technology Platforms
The Envestnet ecosystem is composed of technology platforms that are primarily multi-tenant SAAS-based hybrid cloud offerings that afford us the flexibility to offer a highly scalable consolidated workflow via a web-based user interface that is complemented by an API led open strategy that enables us to offer an integrated omnichannel flexibility and collaboration ecosystem. This open ecosystem strategy has enabled us to abstract, integrate and modernize our offerings at a rapid pace while also enabling our customers and partners to add incremental value on top of our platform via a fit for a purpose managed open ecosystem model.
Envestnet is committed to our operational and information security capabilities as strategic differentiators. We undergo annual SSAE 16 SOC 2 Type II audits to validate the continued operation of our internal controls for our flagship offerings within the ecosystem; the Unified Managed Platform, Yodlee Platform and Tamarac platforms. The SOC reports confirm design and operating effectiveness of internal controls. We maintain multiple redundancies, back up our databases and safeguard technologies and proprietary information consistent with industry best practices. We also maintain a comprehensive business continuity plan and company‑wide risk assessment program that is consistent with industry best practices and that complies with applicable regulatory requirements.
Our proprietary ecosystem provides Enterprise clients in wealth management, Financial advisors that are working alone or as part of financial advisory firms, Financial institutions, and FinTech firms along with their respective customers, access to investment solutions and services, enriched financial data, analytics, and workflows that enables the foundational orchestration of an Intelligent Financial Life via one unified experience, with the widest range of front‑, middle‑ and back‑office needs. The “open architecture” design of our ecosystem and platforms provide our customers and their customers with flexibility in terms of the investment solutions, services they access, data they leverage, and configurability to meet their unique needs. The multi‑tenant platform architecture ensures that this level of flexibility and customization is achieved without requiring us to create unique applications for each client, thereby enabling improved efficacy and efficiency vs other offerings. In addition, though our technology platforms are designed to deliver a breadth of functions, our customers can select from the various investment solutions, services, data, and analytics we offer; without being required to subscribe to or purchase more than what they believe is necessary.
Our data aggregation platform collects a wide variety of end user-permissioned transaction-level data from over 17,000 sources, including banking, investment, loan and credit card information, and puts this data in a common repository. Envestnet Data & Analytics has developed robust proprietary technology and processes and established relationships that allows us to curate these data sources and expand our access to new data sources. Over 70% of this data is collected through structured feeds from our FI customers and other FIs. These structured feeds, which consist of either batch files pushed to us or real-time access, provide this critical data efficiently and at scale. Where we do not have direct connections, we capture data using our proprietary information-gathering techniques.
Beyond collecting data, our data aggregation platform performs a data refining process and augments the data with additional information from a variety of other sources. We enrich the data with a proprietary process, adding such elements as categorization and merchant identification for bank or credit card account data and security identification, classification and normalization for investment data. As our ecosystem usage grows and is exposed to more users, use cases and related data, the system benefits from machine learning algorithms to better normalize, categorize and process large amounts of data, allowing our network to become more effective, efficient and valuable to our customers. Utilizing this enhanced data, including consolidated data from within our FI customers and account data regarding accounts at other FIs, our data intelligence organizes, analyzes and presents it in a manner that helps our customers offer personalized solutions that enable their consumers to achieve better financial outcomes.
Our analytics platform provides a highly scalable cloud-based environment that supports a cost effective and secure way of handling very large data sets, permitting us to develop and test new machine learning algorithms and transform these data sets using the resulting models. The results of the computations can be accessed interactively, as insights, suggestions, or next best actions within our workflow offerings, as files, or via API access for use in third-party or proprietary customer applications and environments to create competitive advantage for our customers and their customers.
In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred technology development costs for all our technology platforms totaling approximately $80 million, $72 million and $60 million, respectively. Of these costs, we capitalized approximately $65 million, $55 million and $34 million, respectively, as internally developed software. 
Sales and Marketing 
We are putting forth an extensive effort in partnering Sales and Marketing to deliver a cohesive and holistic message to the wealth management industry. Efforts to increase the use of technology and sales enablement tools allows for more predictive and effective conversations with our advisor client-base as well as prospective customers.
•Our advisor-facing sales teams are both field sales and internal consultants. Depending on the specific business unit, they are organized regionally or by firm segmentation. They help advisors understand and access our investment solutions, create investment proposals, navigate Envestnet’s wealth management platform and facilitate new business. As an example, our Platform Consulting Group and Business Development Directors help advisors utilize Envestnet’s wealth management platform effectively and efficiently. They are subject matter experts on advisor managed programs, unified managed accounts (“UMA”), proposal guidance and site navigation. They provide consulting services to a number of large clients. Envestnet’s PMC Consulting team of investment professionals provide a variety of portfolio and investment management consulting services to advisors using Envestnet’s wealth management platform. 
•Enterprise Consultants are the main point of contact for enterprise clients with respect to day-to-day platform matters as well as contractual and pricing efforts. This includes support for advisors and firm management with regard to the overall relationship. The enterprise consultant is essentially the client’s relationship manager who serves as the liaison between the firm and Envestnet.
•We have a direct sales and pre-sales team servicing the leading global financial institutions. The FI sales team is divided geographically. Each regional sales and pre-sales team is responsible for acquiring new FI customers. Within the North America region, direct sales and pre-sales representatives are further divided into teams that focus on specific accounts, on a named-account basis, depending on size, location, product specialization and/or brand. Our current customers work most closely with our Client Partner teams who specialize in customer account management and expansion. Together, sales, pre-sales and Client Partners are responsible for growing our customer relationships in terms of establishing new customers, deepening our relationships with existing customers (cross-selling additional products and services into the same or additional groups within a FI) and expanding use of existing products and services (increasing usage).
•We have a direct sales and technical pre-sales team covering financial technology providers in each region. Each regional sales and technical pre-sales team is responsible for acquiring new customers and channel partners. From time to time, we assign specific accounts based upon sales or domain expertise. These teams are supported by a customer success and developer relations team who specialize in customer API integration, and account management and expansion, including services to our channel partners. Together, sales, technical pre-sales, customer success and developer relations representatives are responsible for growing our direct customer and channel partner relationships in terms of account penetration and API usage.
Our marketing efforts are focused on initiatives to drive global company, brand and ecosystem awareness and significant demand generation and sales acceleration across our whole business. Our marketing strategy uses data driven integrated efforts across paid, earned and owned media in order to reach our targeted clients and prospects with the right message at the right time.
To support and expand our current addressable market, our goal is to educate the market and our clients about our solutions and achieve recognition as the industry leader. We plan to drive ongoing communication through thought leadership content, media interviews speaking engagements and industry analyst relations. We also employ a variety of integrated sales and marketing initiatives, including hosting demand generated webinars, sponsorship and partnership of key industry conferences.
Additionally, as practice management and support is important to our advisors' business, we partner on direct email campaigns as well as produce collateral for financial advisors to use with their clients.
Our digital marketing efforts are increasing and are designed to support our clients and to engage audiences in actual and measurable ways. We use digital marketing for search optimization, account base marketing and to drive traffic to our digital solutions and websites. Our integrated creative campaigns consist of online performance advertising, social media, podcasts and digital content marketing. 
During 2021, we further enhanced our use of digital, virtual events as a response to limitations of in person contacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Competition
Our competitors offer a variety of products and services that compete with one or more of the investment solutions and services provided through our ecosystem of technology platforms; although, based on our industry experience, we believe that none offers a more comprehensive set of products and services than we do.
Within Envestnet Wealth Solutions, we compete on the basis of several factors, including:
•The breadth and quality of investment solutions and services to which we provide access through our technology platform;
•The number of custodians that are connected through our technology platforms;
•The price of our investment solutions and services;
•The ease of use of our technology platforms; and
•The nature and scope of investment solutions and services that each wealth management provider believes are necessary to address their needs.
Our Envestnet Data & Analytics group competes with other financial technology companies, credit bureaus and data and analytic providers. Based on our industry experience, we do not believe any other single company in the data aggregation and data intelligence space offers a diverse, comprehensive platform with features such as ours.
Within Envestnet Data & Analytics, we compete on the basis of several factors, including:
•Reputation;
•Cloud-based delivery model;
•Data aggregation capability;
•Access to data through direct structured data feeds to FI’s;
•Scale (size of customer base and level of user adoption);
•Security;
•Time to market;
•Breadth and depth of application functionality user experience;
•Access to third-party applications;
•Ease of use, ease of integration, flexibility and configurability; and
•Competitive pricing.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors. 
Regulation
Overview
The financial services industry is among the most extensively regulated industries in the United States. We operate investment advisory and mutual fund advisory businesses, each of which is subject to a specific regulatory scheme, including regulation at the federal and state level, as well as regulation by self-regulatory organizations and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations of general application.
Our subsidiaries Envestnet Asset Management, Inc. (“EAM”), Envestnet Portfolio Solutions, Inc. (“EPS”), FDX Advisors, Inc., Quantitative Research Group, Inc. (“QRG”), and Envestnet Retirement Solutions, LLC operate investment advisory businesses. These subsidiaries are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as 
“investment advisers” under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and are regulated thereunder. They may also provide fiduciary services as defined in Section 3(21)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), including acting as an “investment manager” (as defined in Section 3(38) of ERISA). As described further below, many of our investment advisory programs are conducted pursuant to the non-exclusive safe harbor from the definition of an “investment company” provided for under Rule 3a-4 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). If Rule 3a-4 were to cease to be available, or if the SEC were to modify the rule or its interpretation of how the rule is applied, it could have a substantial effect on our business. EAM serves as the investment adviser to two mutual funds. Mutual funds are registered as “investment companies” under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act, Investment Company Act and ERISA, together with related regulations and interpretations of the SEC and the Department of Labor (the “DOL”), impose numerous obligations and restrictions on investment advisers and mutual funds, including recordkeeping requirements, limitations on advertising, disclosure and reporting obligations, prohibitions on fraudulent activities and the requirement that conflicts of interest be monitored, mitigated, and disclosed. The fiduciary obligations of investment advisers to their clients require advisers to, among other things, consider the suitability of the investment products and advice they provide, seek “best execution” for their clients’ securities transactions, conduct due diligence on third-party products offered to clients, consider the appropriateness of the adviser’s fees and provide extensive and ongoing disclosure to clients. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose fines and sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and has the power to restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Although we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and the rules and interpretations promulgated thereunder, our failure to comply with such laws, rules and interpretations could have a material adverse effect on us.
Envestnet Data & Analytics is examined on a periodic basis by various regulatory agencies. For example, Envestnet Data & Analytics is a supervised third-party technology service provider subject to multi-agency supervisory examinations in a wide variety of areas based on published guidance by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. These examinations include reviews of Envestnet Data & Analytics’ management, acquisition and development activities, support and delivery, IT and disaster preparedness and business recovery planning. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) is the agency in charge of these examinations.
Either as a result of direct regulation or obligations under customer agreements, our subsidiaries are required to comply with certain provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, related to the privacy of consumer information and may be subject to other privacy and data security laws because of the solutions we provide. In addition, numerous regulations continue to be proposed and promulgated that necessitate the implementation of additional controls of companies like ours.
Our subsidiaries are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations that grant supervisory agencies, including the SEC, DOL and OCC, broad administrative powers. In the event of a failure to comply with these laws and regulations, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on the permissibility of our regulated subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries to engage in business for specified periods of time, censures, fines and the revocation of registration as an investment adviser, as applicable. Additionally, the securities laws and other regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries provide for certain private rights of action that could give rise to civil litigation. Any litigation could have significant financial and non-financial consequences including monetary judgments and the requirement to take action or limit activities that could ultimately affect our business.
Many of the laws and regulations to which our subsidiaries are subject are evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly. We continually develop improvements to our existing products and services as well as new products and services. Many of these improvements or new products and services may implicate regulations to which we may not already be subject or with which we may not have experience. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, including those relating to the activities of our investment adviser, broker-dealer and financial institution clients, may occur that could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business, require significant changes to our systems or solutions or substantially change the way that our clients operate their businesses. Compliance with any new or revised regulatory requirements may divert internal resources, be expensive and time-consuming and may require increased investment in compliance functions or new technologies. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we and our subsidiaries are subject could result in fines, penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our business, or federal or state actions, any of which could significantly harm our reputation, and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
Investment Advisory Program Conducted Under Rule 3a-4
Under the Investment Company Act, an issuer that is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities may be deemed an “investment company,” in which case the issuer may be subject to registration requirements and regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. In order to provide assurance that certain discretionary investment advisory programs would not be considered investment companies, the SEC adopted Rule 3a-4 under the Investment Company Act, which provides a non-exclusive safe harbor from the definition of an investment company for programs that meet the requirements of the rule. We conduct and support the following programs pursuant to the Rule 3a-4 safe harbor:
•Separately managed accounts;
•Unified managed account portfolios;
•Mutual fund portfolios and exchange-traded fund portfolios; and
•Advisor as portfolio manager.
Human Capital Resources
Our Values - Envestnet’s five values create the foundation for our organization
INNOVATION is what differentiates Envestnet’s products and services from our competitors. It is also the way our employees respond to client needs and industry trends, and drive productivity through continuous process improvement and the maximization of resources. Regardless of your position, you have an opportunity to innovate and improve and make Envestnet better. 
CLIENT SERVICE is the hallmark of Envestnet’s brand. We build our business by exceeding our clients’ expectations, listening to and anticipating their needs, and earning their trust; and we believe in treating our colleagues with the same level of integrity and respect. 
COLLABORATION is critical to Envestnet’s ability to stay ahead of the demands of our ever-changing industry. Together, through a culture of generosity, open communication and sharing, we can uphold our mission and shape our industry.
ACCOUNTABILITY is intrinsic to maintaining our clients’ trust, our colleagues’ confidence and our own integrity. At Envestnet we aim for transparency and responsibility in all that we do. By standing behind our work, we can build a stronger business and more lasting client relationships. 
INCLUSION AND RESPECT is how we treat each other and our clients and by nurturing these values and culture, we embrace differences, and appreciate the strength and value of a diverse workforce. We believe that a respectful, innovative, and collaborative workplace attracts the best talent and ultimately fosters the best financial outcomes for advisors and their investors.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DEI”)
We are committed to providing an equitable, diverse and inclusive work culture, where everyone is treated fairly, feels a sense of belonging and value, and has the resources and support they need to achieve their full potential. As part of this commitment, in 2021 we formed our DEI Executive Council which is comprised of eight Senior Leadership members and champions Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives across four pillars – training, workforce diversity, professional development, and community impact. 
In 2020, Envestnet Bridges, was created to encourage all employees to participate in conversations regarding diversity and differences, building greater understanding and enhancing our Envestnet community. Envestnet Bridges has hosted monthly conversations on far reaching topics such as Allyship, Understanding Language, and Racism -- Why Your Story Matters.
Our Women’s Initiative Network continues to provide women with the tools, training, and networking connections to advance in their careers, and build a platform for them to succeed. 
We are committed to DEI globally. In 2021 we launched the Encourage, Engage, Evolve Mentoring Program which matched 18 female leaders in the United States with female leaders in Trivandrum, India. The program promotes the role of women in leadership, builds networking connections, and defines career development. 
Also in 2021, Envestnet partnered with the University of Delaware Women’s Leadership to launch two successful virtual cohorts. The program emphasizes advancing women in their leadership journey. 
Envestnet is the inaugural ambassador for Money Management Institute, an organization with a mission to prepare under-represented talent for the financial tech industry.
Envestnet continues to invest in organizations and programs that enhance our connection to our community and bring to life our commitment to diversity and inclusion.
Workforce Demographics
In 2021, we launched “People Manager Dashboards” which provide U.S.-based managers with anonymous information regarding the race/ethnicity and gender demographics of their teams, as well as information regarding open positions, promotions, terminations. This data helps managers pinpoint opportunities to increase diversity when hiring, promoting, and developing employees. Our employee population is primarily located in the United States and India. Our global workforce increased 3% in 2021 from approximately 4,250 full-time employees in 2020 to approximately 4,375 full-time employees in 2021, with 39% and 43%, respectively, based in the United States. No employee is represented in a collective bargaining agreement. 
Learning & Development
Through our global learning management system, employees have access to over 19,000 learning courses, including management and skills development; and U.S. based employees receive reimbursement for training, certifications, and degrees. During 2020 and 2021, our employees completed over 32,000 courses and over 57,000 courses, respectively. In the third quarter 2021, we launched a new learning platform with significant engagement, with over 10,000 hours of content viewed and over 8,800 courses were completed.
The Envestnet Institute on Campus (“EIOC”) is a program for motivated university students designed to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and the application of this knowledge in the Wealth and Asset Management industries. Many of our employees have graduated from this key Learning and Development program. The curriculum is currently offered at 47 schools, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities such as Howard University. The program includes mentoring, job placement, and financial literacy initiatives. As of June 30, 2021, over 4,700 students have completed the program averaging an approximate 70% completion rate. More than 1,800 women and over 1,600 students of color have completed the program. EIOC continues to support job and internship placements through its résumé database, which contains 2,000 résumés for employers seeking workforce-ready employees for internships and entry-level positions. 
The Envestnet Scholarship Program has expanded its partnership with the CFP Board to offer scholarships to undergraduate students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the financial planning profession who are pursuing their Certified Financial Planner™ designation. Women and minorities who are undergraduates can apply for these scholarships. As of June 30, 2021, 53 scholarships totaling over $280,000 have been granted. 
Envestnet’s 2021 Intern cohort demographics were our most diverse to date, with approximately 45% self-identifying as black, indigenous, people of color or non-white. Approximately 32% of the interns in 2021 were female. 
The Envestnet Summer Internship Program is a full-time, paid internship designed for qualified college students to gain hands-on experience at Envestnet in all office locations. Interns work alongside department experts, participate in Envestnet's Institute On Campus, attend weekly “Lunch and Learns” with leaders of the business, and collaborate with fellow Envestnet interns on a summer project. Top performing interns can interview for full time employment after graduation through Envestnet's Rotational Program. 
Engagement
In 2021, during our annual employee survey, we scored four points above the industry benchmark for employee engagement. In our 2020 employee survey, which primarily focused on the employee experience during the pandemic, 94% of respondents strongly agreed with the statement, “My organization responded to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in a way that demonstrates care for its employees’ well-being.” 
In Our Community
The Envestnet Cares program empowers our employees to engage in their local communities with paid time off for volunteer activities, charitable donation matching, and partnerships with several non-profit organizations. U.S. employees receive a match up to $3,000 annually. In 2020, our regular charitable giving was approximately $1.2 million. In 2021 we donated $1 million worldwide. We also made a one-time $5.0 million charitable contribution in 2020 in memory of our former chief executive officer.
In 2021, our employees received three paid Volunteer Days for use when volunteering for a non-profit organization of their choice during the workweek, or as part of a Company-organized volunteering event. In 2020, our employees volunteered 127 hours and participated in 4 company-sponsored events in 3 cities prior to March 13, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, in-person events were canceled starting in March 2020. Despite canceling in person volunteer events, our employees still volunteered over 2,400 hours in 2021, as employees participated in both virtual events and other volunteer events in their communities.
Total Rewards
To attract and retain top talent in our highly competitive industry, we offer employees a comprehensive total rewards package. For U.S. based employees, this includes competitive base pay, annual bonus consideration, long-term incentive grants, employer-subsidized health, dental, and vision insurance, employer match for retirement savings, paid time off, group term life and disability insurance, college tuition reimbursement and scholarships, as well as paid parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child, and military leave with pay differential. In 2020, Envestnet added a parental stipend for employees with children under age 6 and in 2021, Envestnet added adoption and surrogacy to further support our employees in balancing work and life. 
All U.S. based, full-time employees also receive nine paid holidays, a minimum of three weeks paid time off, two floating holidays, and three paid volunteer days per year. India-based employees receive standard health and welfare benefits, as well as additional family medical coverage, an internet stipend, and free transportation home from late shifts. Envestnet supports our employees’ physical and mental health with a no-cost Wellness Program; and provides legal, financial, and work-life solutions with our Employee Assistance Program.
Pandemic Response
We care about our colleagues and anyone who enters our workplace. Our continuing focus on the health and well-being of our colleagues has enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our employees and workplace visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our Pandemic Response Team, which includes our CEO, President, and other senior members of management, meet weekly to assess the risks and status for each office location and to ensure business continuity.
All of our employees began working remotely in March 2020. Our Pandemic Response Team has established protocols to ensure the safety of our employees while working remotely and upon return to our office locations. This included mandatory COVID-19 training, advanced cleaning protocols for all offices, modified workspaces, and communication that provides employees with regular updates regarding Envestnet’s response to the impact of the pandemic. Beginning in 2022, employees were welcomed back to the office once their proof of vaccination was received; for the majority of employees, returning to the office continues to be on a voluntary basis.
During the pandemic, our employees also received additional benefits to support home-office set-up (U.S. and India), parental stipend (U.S.), additional health insurance (India), and utility stipend (India), as well as multiple initiatives and organized activities to support mental wellness, morale and team building.
