Narrative Description of Business
 
The Origins of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM
 
The Company’s operations began in 1976 when James F. McCann, the Company’s founder and current Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, acquired a single retail florist in New York City, which he subsequently expanded to a 14-store chain. Thereafter, the Company modified its business strategy to take advantage of the rapid emergence of toll-free calling. The Company acquired the right to use the toll-free telephone number 1-800-FLOWERS, adopted it as its corporate identity and began to aggressively build a national brand around it.
The Company’s Strategy
 
1-800-FLOWERS.COM’s objective is to be the leading authority on thoughtful gifting, to serve an expanding range of our customers’ celebratory needs, thereby helping our customers express themselves and connect with the important people in their lives. The Company will continue to build on the trusted relationships with our customers by providing them with ease of access, tasteful and appropriate gifts, and superior service. By engaging with our customers, we help to inspire more human expression and connection – sentiments that are more important than ever in the current environment.
 
The Company believes that 1-800-FLOWERS.COM is one of the most recognized brands in the floral and gift industry. The strength of its brand has enabled the Company to extend its product offerings beyond the floral category into complementary products, which include gourmet popcorn, cookies and related baked and snack food products, premium chocolate and confections, wine gifts, gourmet gift baskets, fruit bouquet arrangements, and gift-quality fruit baskets, dipped berries, as well as steaks, chops and prepared meals. Most recently, on August 3, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of PersonalizationMall.com LLC ("PersonalizationMall"), adding an extensive selection of personalized products to our offerings, and on October 27, 2021, acquired Vital Choice Seafood LLC (“Vital Choice”), a purveyor of wild-caught seafood and sustainably farmed shellfish, pastured proteins, and organic foods. On December 31, 2021, the Company acquired Alice’s Table® to supplement our product portfolio with lifestyle offerings, including fully digital livestreaming floral, culinary and other experiences to guests across the country. This extended line of gift offerings helps our customers with all of their celebratory occasions, and will enable the Company to increase the purchase frequency and average order value for existing customers who have come to trust the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brand, as well as continue to attract new customers. The Company’s consolidated customer database and multi-brand website is designed to dynamically engage our customers, further enhancing the Company’s position as a leading, one-stop destination for all of our customers’ gifting and celebratory needs.
 
As part of the Company’s continuing effort to serve the thoughtful gifting needs of our customers, and leverage its business platform, the Company continues to execute its vision to build a “Celebratory Ecosystem”, including a collection of premium gifting brands, and an increasing suite of products and services designed to help our customers deliver smiles to the important people in their lives.
 
The platform that the Company has built allows it to expand rapidly into new product categories using a “marketplace” concept, providing its customers with a wider selection of solutions to help them express, connect and celebrate for all occasions and recipients – including themselves. The Company intends to accomplish this through organic development, and where appropriate, through acquisition of complementary businesses. A summary of the Company’s significant brands and/or businesses follows:

The Company’s Products and Service Offerings
 
The Company offers a wide range of products including fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit arrangements and plants, gifts, personalized products, dipped berries, popcorn, gourmet foods and gift baskets, cookies, chocolates, candy, wine, and gift-quality fruit. In order to maximize sales opportunities, products are not exclusive to certain brands, and may be sold across business categories. The Company’s differentiated and value-added product offerings create the opportunity to have a relationship with customers who purchase items not only for gift-giving occasions but also for everyday consumption. The Company’s product development team works closely with its production team to select and design its floral, gourmet foods and gift baskets, as well as other gift-related products that accommodate our customers' needs to celebrate a special occasion or convey a sentiment. As part of this continuing effort, the Company intends to continue to develop differentiated products and signature collections that customers have embraced and come to expect.
 
The Company’s net revenues from international sources were not material during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.
 
Flowers and Plants. The Company’s flagship 1-800-Flowers.com brand offers fresh-cut flowers and floral and fruit arrangements for all occasions and holidays, available for same-day delivery. The Company provides its customers with a choice of florist designed products, including traditional floral and gift offerings, and the Company’s line of fruit arrangements, under the Fruit Bouquets brand, and flowers delivered fresh from the farm. The Company also offers a wide variety of popular plants to brighten the home and/or office, and accent gardens and landscapes. With the acquisition of Alice’s Table the Company now also provides lifestyle offerings, including fully digital livestreaming floral, culinary and other experiences to guests across the country.
Personalized Gifts. Through its PersonalizationMall brand, the Company offers a wide assortment of products using sublimation, embroidery, digital printing, engraving, and sandblasting to provide a unique, personalized experience to our customers.
Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets. Harry & David is a vertically integrated, multi-channel specialty retailer and producer of branded premium gift-quality fruit, food products, land and sea-based proteins, and gifts marketed under the Harry & David, Wolferman’s Bakery, Vital Choice, Cushman’s and Moose Munch brands. The Company also licenses the Stock Yards name through which it sells premium meats. The Company manufactures premium cookies and baked gift items under the Cheryl’s and Mrs. Beasley’s brands, which are delivered in beautiful and innovative gift boxes and containers, providing customers with a variety of assortments from which to choose. The Popcorn Factory brand pops premium popcorn and specialty snack products. The 1-800-BASKETS.COM brand features a collection of gourmet gift baskets and related products confected by DesignPac, as well as through third parties. Simply Chocolate offers artisan chocolates and confections. Many of the Company’s gourmet products are packaged in seasonal, occasion specific or decorative tins, fitting the “giftable” requirement of individual customers, while also adding the capability to customize the tins with corporate logos and other personalized features for the Company’s corporate customers’ gifting needs.
 
BloomNet. The Company’s BloomNet business provides its members with products and services, including: (i) settlement processing, consisting of the settlement of orders between referring florists (including the 1-800-Flowers.com brand) and fulfilling florists, (ii) advertising, in the form of member directories, including the industry’s first on-line directory, (iii) access services, by which BloomNet florists are able to refer and fulfill orders, using Bloomlink®, the Company’s proprietary Internet-based system, (iv) other products and services, including web hosting, marketing, designer education and point of sale systems, and (v) wholesale products, which consist of branded and non-branded floral supplies, enabling member florists to reduce their costs through 1-800-Flowers.com purchasing leverage, while also ensuring that member florists will be able to fulfill 1-800-Flowers.com brand orders based on recipe specifications. While maintaining industry-high quality standards for its 1-800-Flowers.com brand customers, the Company offers florists a compelling value proposition, offering products and services that its florists need to grow their business and to enhance profitability.
 
Marketing and Promotion
 
The Company’s marketing and promotional strategy is designed to strengthen the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brands, engage with its customers, increase customer acquisition, build customer loyalty, encourage repeat purchases and drive long-term growth. The Company’s goal is to create a celebratory ecosystem that makes its brands synonymous with thoughtful gifting and to help our customers “send smiles” every day. To do this, the Company intends to invest in its brands and acquire new customers through the use of selective on and off-line media, direct marketing, public relations, social media and strategic relationships, while cost-effectively capitalizing on the Company’s large and loyal customer base. The Company’s focus is to create marketing messaging that is more relevant to the customer, to engage with our customers in a two-way dialog and to focus on the experience of the connection. It plans to improve customer purchase frequency via product exposure through its multi-brand portal, and our Celebrations Passport® loyalty program, as well as continually investing and innovating how and where it engages with its customers.

The Company’s strong appeal and brand recognition provide it with significant marketing opportunities. For example, the Company was featured in an episode of the CBS TV hit reality show Undercover Boss, providing a great opportunity for its brands to receive broad national exposure, while also being included in the Walk of Shame movie. Our “Summer of a Million Smiles” charitable efforts deliver smiles to local charities, communities and service initiatives across the country. We also sponsor our enterprise-wide “Gifts That Give Back” collection in support of our Smiles Farms philanthropic initiative, which is focused on creating meaningful employment opportunities for individuals with developmental disabilities – a program that we are proud to have founded. And, in what can be considered one of the best compliments a brand can receive, 1-800-Flowers.com’s place in America’s cultural fabric was confirmed when the brand was featured in a great spoof on Mother’s Day family relations during a Saturday Night Live skit.
 
Technology Infrastructure
 
The Company believes it has been and continues to be a leader in implementing new technologies to give its customers the best possible shopping experience, whether online or over the telephone. Orders are fed directly from the Company’s secure websites, or with the assistance of a gift advisor, into our internally developed transaction processing system, which captures the required customer and recipient information. The system then routes the order to the appropriate distribution center or, for florist fulfilled or drop-shipped items, selects a florist or vendor to fulfill the customer's order and electronically refers the necessary information using BloomLink, the Company’s proprietary Internet-based system. The Company’s gift advisors have electronic access to this system, enabling them to assist in order fulfillment and subsequently track other customer and/or order information.
Fulfillment and Manufacturing Operations
 
The Company’s customers primarily place their orders either online or over the telephone. The Company’s hybrid fulfillment system, which enables the Company to offer same-day, next-day and any-day delivery, combines the use of BloomNet (comprised of independent florists operating retail flower shops and franchise florist shops) with Company-owned distribution centers and vendors who ship directly to the Company’s customers. While providing a significant competitive advantage in terms of delivery options, the Company’s fulfillment system also has the added benefit of reducing the Company’s capital investments in inventory and infrastructure. The Company’s products are backed by a 100% satisfaction guarantee, and the Company’s business is not dependent on any single third-party supplier.
 
Fulfillment and manufacturing of products is as follows:
 
Flowers and Plants. A majority of the Company’s floral orders are fulfilled by one of the Company’s BloomNet members, allowing the Company to deliver its floral and fruit bouquet products on a same-day or next-day basis to ensure freshness and to meet its customers’ need for immediate gifting. In addition to these florist designed products, the Company also offers fresh cut floral arrangements in a wide assortment of combinations, themes and designer bouquets and collections through its direct ship products program, fresh from the farm.
Personalized Gifts. Through its acquisition of PersonalizationMall, the Company offers a broad selection of personalized gifts and keepsakes which are manufactured utilizing same-day/next-day capabilities, and distributed from its Bolingbrook, IL facility.
Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets. The Company offers a wide array of premium brand signature baked products, confections, gift baskets, gourmet popcorn, dipped berries, giftable fruit towers and baskets, and "good for you" products through its Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets’ brands. The Company’s Cheryl’s cookies and baked gifts are manufactured in its baking facility in Westerville, Ohio, while The Popcorn Factory and Moose Munch premium snack products are popped in Medford, Oregon and Lake Forest, Illinois. Harry & David products are grown and manufactured primarily from its facilities in Medford, Oregon, supplemented by specialty products that are sourced across the U.S. and the world. Gift basket confection and fulfillment for both wholesale and 1-800-Baskets.com is handled by DesignPac, located in Melrose Park, Illinois. Our products are distributed from a combination of Company owned and leased distribution facilities, across the country, which are shared by our brands in order to reduce both transit time to customer and overall logistics costs. Dipped berries and other specialty treats for our Shari’s Berries brand are manufactured and fulfilled through our network of dropship vendors.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The Company’s raw materials consist of ingredients for manufactured products (including various commodities such as sugar, flour, cacao, eggs, fruit and flowers), packaging supplies, and other supplies used in the manufacturing and transportation processes (such as fuel, natural gas and derivative products). Except for certain crops which are grown in our Harry & David orchards, all of the raw materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source suppliers. The prices we pay, and the availability of these materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. We utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume we need to meet customer demand, to receive those materials timely through our supply chain and to produce, manufacture and distribute those products determines, in part, our ability to grow the business, and the appeal of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers.
Seasonality
 
The Company’s quarterly results may experience seasonal fluctuations. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business, and its continued expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company’s second fiscal quarter, generates over 40% of the Company’s annual revenues, and all of its earnings. However, with the onset of the pandemic of the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”), our customers increasingly turned to our brands and our expanded product offerings to help them connect and express themselves, and our “everyday” gifting product line had experienced significantly increased volume. While the continuing impacts of COVID-19, and its after effects, are difficult to predict, the Company expects that its fiscal second quarter will continue to be its largest in terms of annual revenues and earnings. Due to the number of major floral gifting occasions, including Mother's Day, Valentine’s Day, Easter and Administrative Professionals Week, revenues also rise during the Company’s fiscal third and fourth quarters in comparison to its fiscal first quarter. During fiscal 2022, our fiscal second quarter revenues represented approximately 43% of annual revenues, while our first, third and fourth quarters generated 14%, 21%, and 22% of annual revenues, respectively.
 
In preparation for the Company’s second quarter holiday season, the Company significantly increases its inventories. This seasonal build has traditionally been financed by cash flows from operations, supplemented by a bank line of credit, which peaks in November. The Company has historically repaid all revolving bank lines of credit with cash generated from operations, prior to the end of the Company’s fiscal second quarter.
 
Competition
 
The growing popularity and convenience of e-commerce shopping has continued to give rise to established businesses on the Internet. In addition to selling their products over the Internet, many of these retailers sell their products through a combination of channels by maintaining a website, a toll-free phone number and physical locations. Additionally, several of these merchants offer an expanding variety of products and some are attracting an increasing number of customers. Certain mass merchants have expanded their offerings to include competing products and may continue to do so in the future. These businesses, as well as other potential competitors, may be able to:
 
● undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and services;
 ● adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and
 ● make more attractive offers to potential employees, distributors and retailers.
 
In addition, the Company faces intense competition in each of its individual product categories. In the floral industry, there are various providers of floral products, none of which is dominant in the industry. The Company’s competitors include:
 
● retail floral shops, some of which maintain toll-free telephone numbers and websites;
 ● online floral retailers, as well as retailers offering substitute gift products;
 ● catalog companies that offer floral products;
 ● floral telemarketers and wire services; and
 ● supermarkets, mass merchants and specialty retailers with floral departments.
 
Similarly, the plant, gift basket and gourmet foods categories are highly competitive. Each of these categories encompasses a wide range of products, is highly fragmented and is served by a large number of companies, none of which is dominant. Products in these categories may be purchased from a number of outlets, including mass merchants, telemarketers, retail specialty shops, online retailers and mail-order catalogs.
 
    6 

  

The Company believes the strength of its brands, product selection, customer relationships, technology infrastructure and fulfillment capabilities position it to compete effectively against its current and potential competitors in each of its product categories. However, increased competition could result in:
 
● price reductions, decreased revenues and lower profit margins;
 ● loss of market share; and
 ● increased marketing expenditures.
 
These and other competitive factors may adversely impact the Company’s business and results of operations.
 
Government Regulation and Legal Uncertainties
 
The Internet continues to evolve and there are laws and regulations directly applicable to e-commerce. Legislatures are also considering an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the Internet, including laws and regulations addressing:

● | user privacy; 
--+------------------------------------------------------
● | pricing; 
● | content; 
● | connectivity; 
● | intellectual property; 
● | distribution; 
● | taxation and tariffs; 
● | liabilities; 
● | antitrust; and 
● | characteristics and quality of products and services.

 
Further, the growth and development of the market for online services may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations may impair the growth of the Internet or commercial online services. This could decrease the demand for the Company’s services and increase its cost of doing business. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws regarding issues like property ownership, taxes, libel and personal privacy is uncertain. Any new legislation or regulation that has an adverse impact on the Internet or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
States or foreign countries might attempt to regulate the Company’s business or levy additional sales or other taxes relating to its activities. Because the Company’s products and services are available over the Internet anywhere in the world, multiple jurisdictions may claim that the Company is required to do business as a foreign corporation in one or more of those jurisdictions. Failure to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where the Company is required to do so could subject it to taxes and penalties. States or foreign governments may charge the Company with violations of local laws.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
The Company regards its service marks, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names and similar intellectual property as critical to its success. The Company has applied for or received trademark and/or service mark registration for, among others, “1-800-FLOWERS.COM”, “1-800-FLOWERS”, “1-800-Baskets.com”, “FruitBrouquets.com”, “BloomNet”, “GreatFood.com”, “The Popcorn Factory”, “Cheryl’s Cookies”, “Mrs. Beasley’s”, “Celebrations Passport”, “Flowerama”, “DesignPac”, “Napco”, “Harry & David”, “Wolferman’s Bakery", “Moose Munch”, Cushman’s”, “Simply Chocolate”, “Personalization Universe”, “PersonalizationMall”, “Shari’s Berries”, “Vital Choice” and “Alice’s Table”. The Company also has rights to numerous domain names, including: www.1800flowers.com, www.800flowers.com, www.1800baskets.com, www.flowers.com, www.personalizationuniverse.com, www.personalizationmall.com, www.plants.com, www.florists.com, www.greatfoods.com, www.stockyards.com, www.cheryls.com, www.celebrations.com, www.flowerama.com, www.designpac.com, www.simplychocolate.com, www.mybloomnet.net, www.napcoimports.com, www.thepopcornfactory.com, www.harryanddavid.com, www.wolfermans.com, www.vitalchoice.com, www.alicestable.com, www.berries.com, and www.sharisberries.com. In addition, the Company owns a number of international trademarks and/or service marks. The Company has also developed transaction processing and operating systems as well as marketing data, and customer and recipient information databases.
 
    7 

  

The Company relies on trademark, unfair competition and copyright law, trade secret protection and contracts such as confidentiality and license agreements with its employees, customers, vendors and others to protect its proprietary rights. Despite the Company’s precautions, it may be possible for competitors to obtain and/or use the Company’s proprietary information without authorization or to develop technologies similar to the Company’s and independently create a similarly functioning infrastructure. Furthermore, the protection of proprietary rights in Internet-related industries is uncertain and still evolving. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The Company’s means of protecting its proprietary rights in the United States or abroad may not be adequate.
 
Third parties have in the past infringed or misappropriated the Company’s intellectual property or similar proprietary rights. The Company believes infringements and misappropriations will continue to occur in the future. The Company intends to guard against infringement and misappropriation. However, the Company cannot guarantee it will be able to enforce its rights and enjoin the alleged infringers from their use of confusingly similar trademarks, service marks, telephone numbers and domain names.
 
In addition, third parties may assert infringement claims against the Company. The Company cannot be certain that its technologies or its products and services do not infringe valid patents, trademarks, copyrights or other proprietary rights held by third parties. The Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to its intellectual property and the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of its business. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management resources away from running the Company’s business.
 
Human Capital
 
Employees. We focus on attracting, developing and retaining skilled, diverse talent, including recruiting from among the universities across the markets in which we compete and are generally able to select top talent. We focus on developing our employees by providing a variety of job experiences, training programs and skill development opportunities. As of July 3, 2022, the Company had approximately 4,700 full and part-time employees, all located in the United States. During peak periods, the Company substantially increases the number of customer service, manufacturing, and fulfillment personnel. The Company’s employees are not represented under collective bargaining agreements and the Company considers its relations with its employees to be good. Our employees are a key source of competitive advantage and their actions, guided by our Code of Ethics, are critical to the long- term success of our business.
Workforce Diversity. As a company we are committed to building an inclusive and equitable culture that embraces and celebrates our associates’ diverse backgrounds and unique life experiences.
 
Compensation and Benefits. The Company aims to attract and retain a talented workforce by offering competitive compensation and benefits, strong career development and a respectful and inclusive culture that provides equal opportunity for all. We believe our base wages and salaries, which we review annually, are fair and competitive with the external labor markets in which our associates work. We encourage and reward employees based upon the achievement of financial and other key performance metrics, which strengthens the connection between pay and performance. We also grant equity compensation awards that vest over time through our long-term incentive plan to eligible associates to align such associates’ incentives with the Company’s long-term strategic objectives and the interests of our stockholders. We also offer competitive benefit programs, in line with local practices with flexibility to accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce, including paid vacation and holidays, family leave, disability insurance, life insurance, healthcare, and a 401(k) plan with a company match.
Health, Safety and Wellness. From a workplace safety standpoint, we focus on training, awareness, behavioral based work observation practices, and culture in our continuous effort to reduce workplace injuries and accidents. We are continually focused on the safety of our associates and have a strong emphasis on identifying and addressing the safety risks to and concerns of our associates. We acted quickly to develop and implement enhanced safety protocols to address the COVID-19 pandemic and protect the health and safety of our associates.
