Item 1. Business
Overview
At Neurocrine Biosciences, our purpose is simple: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options. For three decades, we have applied our unique insight into neuroscience to advance medicines for neurology, neuroendocrinology and neuropsychiatry-related disorders and diseases. Our efforts have resulted in United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved treatments for tardive dyskinesia, Parkinson’s disease, endometriosis* and uterine fibroids* and a diversified portfolio of investigational therapies with the potential to address unmet clinical needs of patients worldwide living with neurological, endocrine and psychiatric disorders. (*in collaboration with AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie)
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the ways in which we live and interact with one another. While we adapt to this new shared reality, our purpose remains unchanged: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options.
Although the initial impact of the pandemic has subsided, we are uncertain as to how more transmissible variants may impact our business. We remain committed to (1) prioritizing the safety, health and well-being of patients and their caregivers, healthcare providers, and our employees; (2) ensuring patients with tardive dyskinesia are well supported and have continued uninterrupted access to INGREZZA, for which we have not experienced and currently do not expect any supply disruption; and (3) advancing clinical studies. 
Most of our field-based employees have resumed in-person interactions in accordance with location-specific guidance. Our office-based employees have returned to the office under flexible work arrangement guidelines to help balance business needs, employee health, well-being and safety and the evolving work environment. However, as the effects of the pandemic continue to rapidly evolve with the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, a remote work model may nevertheless need to be reinstated at some point in the future. We continue to evaluate the impact of global spikes or surges in COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates, as well as the impact of emerging COVID-19 variants on the efficacy of vaccines.
Most hospitals, community mental health facilities, physicians’ offices, pharmacies and other healthcare facilities have relaxed their policies that limited access of patients and our employees to such facilities and limited the ability of patients, pharmacies and prescribers to interact with each other. However, we anticipate these policies may change from time to time as communities or regions grapple with outbreaks. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any lasting effects on our revenue and the way we conduct our business, is highly uncertain and subject to continued change. We recognize that this pandemic will continue to present unique challenges for us throughout 2022.
Product Pipeline
Commercially Available Medicines
INGREZZA® (valbenazine). We launched INGREZZA in the United States in May 2017 as the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. INGREZZA net product sales totaled $1.1 billion for 2021, $993.1 million for 2020 and $752.9 million for 2019 and represent the significant majority of our total net product sales.
INGREZZA provides a once-daily dosing treatment option for tardive dyskinesia and has three dosing options (40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg capsules), with a recommended dose of 40 mg taken for the first seven days of treatment and an option to take 40 mg, 60 mg or 80 mg thereafter, depending on the patient’s dosing needs.
We out-licensed the rights to valbenazine in Japan and other select Asian markets to Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharmaceutical Company, or MTPC, in 2015, in which markets valbenazine is a royalty-bearing product for us. In 2021, MTPC received approvals for marketing authorization for valbenazine for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in Indonesia, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. In addition, MTPC has submitted filings for marketing authorization, which are currently under review, in Japan and Malaysia.
Tardive dyskinesia is a movement disorder that is characterized by uncontrollable, abnormal and repetitive movements of the face, torso and/or other body parts, which may be disruptive and negatively impact patients. The condition is associated with prolonged use of treatments that block dopamine receptors in the brain, such as antipsychotics commonly prescribed to treat mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and certain anti-nausea medications. In patients with tardive dyskinesia, these treatments are thought to result in irregular dopamine signaling in a region of the brain that controls movement. The symptoms of tardive dyskinesia can be severe and are often persistent and irreversible. Tardive dyskinesia affects an estimated 600,000 people in the United States.
ONGENTYS® (opicapone). We launched ONGENTYS in the United States in September 2020 as an FDA-approved add-on treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson's disease experiencing motor fluctuations. We acquired the United States and Canada rights to ONGENTYS in February 2017.
ONGENTYS is a once-daily, peripheral, selective and reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase, or COMT, inhibitor. COMT inhibitors are utilized to prolong the duration of effect of levodopa, the primary treatment option for Parkinson’s disease patients, during periods of the day where the effects of levodopa wear off and motor symptoms worsen, also known as “off” time.
Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by low dopamine levels produced in the brain. Dopamine helps transmit signals between the areas of the brain that control all purposeful movements, including talking, walking and writing. As Parkinson’s disease progresses, dopamine production steadily decreases, resulting in increased problems with motor symptoms including slowed movement, tremor, rigidity, impaired posture and balance and difficulty with speech and writing. Parkinson’s disease affects an estimated 1 million people in the United States and more than 10 million people worldwide.
ORILISSA® (elagolix tablets). AbbVie launched ORILISSA in the United States in August 2018 as an FDA-approved oral medication for the management of moderate to severe endometriosis pain in women. We out-licensed the global rights to elagolix to AbbVie in 2010. Elagolix is a royalty-bearing product for us.
Endometriosis affects nearly 200 million women worldwide, including more than 10 million women in the United States.
ORIAHNN® (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate capsules and elagolix capsules). AbbVie launched ORIAHNN in the United States in June 2020 as the first FDA-approved non-surgical, oral medication option for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women. We out-licensed the global rights to elagolix to AbbVie in 2010. Elagolix is a royalty-bearing product for us.
Uterine fibroids are benign hormonally responsive tumors that form in the wall of the uterus with a prevalence rate of at least 25% and are a leading indication for hysterectomy, resulting in the performance of more than 200,000 hysterectomies per year in the United States alone.
Our Pipeline of Investigational Therapies
Neurology
Chorea in Huntington Disease (valbenazine – VMAT2 Inhibitor). We have announced positive top-line data from the KINECT-HD study, a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of valbenazine in 120 adult patients with chorea in Huntington disease. The study met the primary endpoint of reduction in severity of chorea, the cardinal motor feature in Huntington disease, as measured by the change in the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale, or UHDRS®, total maximal chorea, or TMC, score from baseline to the average score at weeks 10 and 12. Treatment with valbenazine resulted in a placebo-adjusted mean reduction in the TMC score of 3.2 units (p < 0.0001), indicating a highly statistically significant improvement in chorea. The TMC score is part of the motor assessment of the UHDRS and measures chorea in seven different body parts, including the face, oral-buccal-lingual region, trunk, and each limb independently. The TMC score is the sum of the individual scores and ranges from 0 to 28. The secondary endpoints of Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) Response Status and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) Response Status were also statistically significant in favor of treatment with valbenazine. We plan to submit a supplemental new drug application for valbenazine for the treatment of Huntington chorea with the FDA in the second half of 2022. 
VMAT2 is a protein concentrated in the human brain that is essential for the transmission of nerve impulses between neurons. VMAT2 is primarily responsible for packaging and transporting monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine) in neurons. Specifically, dopamine enables neurotransmission among nerve cells that are involved in voluntary and involuntary motor control. In neurology, disease states such as tardive dyskinesia, Huntington chorea and tardive dystonia are characterized in part by a hyperdopaminergic state in the brain and modulation of neuronal dopamine levels may provide symptomatic benefits for patients with these conditions, among others. Huntington disease is a hereditary progressive neurodegenerative disorder, in which destruction of neuronal cells within the brain results in motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Symptoms generally appear between the ages of 30 to 50 and worsen over a 10 to 25-year period. Many patients with Huntington disease experience chorea, a troublesome involuntary movement disorder, in which patients develop sudden, irregular, unpredictable, and non-stereotyped movements. Chorea can affect various body parts, and may interfere with speech, swallowing, posture, and gait. Approximately 90% of the estimated 30,000 people affected by Huntington disease in the United Sates will develop chorea over the course of the disease.
Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy (valbenazine – VMAT2 Inhibitor). We have initiated a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of valbenazine for the treatment of dyskinetic cerebral palsy in 144 pediatric and adult patients (aged 6 and older). We anticipate having top-line data for this clinical study in 2023. 
VMAT2 is a protein concentrated in the human brain that is essential for the transmission of nerve impulses between neurons. VMAT2 is primarily responsible for packaging and transporting monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine) in neurons.

In neurology, disease states such as tardive dyskinesia, Huntington chorea and tardive dystonia are characterized in part by a hyperdopaminergic state in the brain and modulation of neuronal dopamine levels may provide symptomatic benefits for patients with these conditions, among others. Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is a non-progressive, permanent disorder marked by involuntary movement and is a result of damage to the fetal or infant brain’s basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are responsible for submitting messages to the body to help coordinate and control movements. When damaged, voluntary movements are compromised, resulting in involuntary and abnormal movements. It affects development and movement and has long term effects on patients’ quality of life. The long-term outlook for patients with dyskinetic cerebral palsy will depend upon the severity of the brain damage and how well the treatment works. Dyskinetic cerebral palsy affects up to 15% of the estimated 500,000 to 1 million people affected by cerebral palsy in the United States. 
Essential Tremor (NBI-827104 – T-Type Calcium Channel Blocker). We have initiated a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NBI-827104 in 28 adult patients with essential tremor. We anticipate having top-line data from this clinical study during the middle of 2022. 
NBI-827104 is a potent, selective, orally active and brain penetrating T-type calcium channel blocker. We acquired the global rights to NBI-827104 in May 2020. Essential tremor is one of the most common neurological disorders in adults. The disorder is characterized by involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movements that most often affect the upper limbs. As the disease progresses, tremor severity often increases and spreads to other parts of the body. Essential tremor has a significant impact on the activities of daily living often resulting in functional disability as the disease progresses and is associated with a high comorbidity rate of social phobia, depression and anxiety. Essential tremor affects an estimated 10 million people in the United States.
Epilepsy. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders and is characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain that leads to unpredictable seizures that can vary in frequency, from less than one per year to several per day A description of our investigational treatments for potential use in epilepsy follow.
Epileptic Encephalopathy with Continuous Spike and Wave During Sleep, or EE-CSWS (NBI-827104 – T-Type Calcium Channel Blocker). We have initiated the STEAMBOATTM study, a Phase II multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NBI-827104 in 24 pediatric patients (aged 4 to 12 years) with EE-CSWS, a rare pediatric form of epilepsy. We anticipate having top-line data from this clinical study during the second half of 2022. 
NBI-827104 is a potent, selective, orally active and brain penetrating T-type calcium channel blocker. Due to the differentiated mechanism of action of this molecule, when compared to non-selective calcium channel inhibitors, treatment with NBI-827104 could lead to an enhanced benefit risk profile for patients with this rare pediatric form of epilepsy. We acquired the global rights to NBI-827104 in May 2020. EE-CSWS is a rare pediatric form of epilepsy. The typical onset of EE-CSWS occurs in children (aged 2 to 4 years) with a variety of seizure types, including atypical absence seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal seizures, that occur primarily during sleep. Seizures associated with EE-CSWS, which often resolve around puberty, interfere with processes critical to learning and memory. Children with EE-CSWS often present with neurocognitive regression that can remain even after the seizures associated with EE-CSWS have resolved. It is estimated that EE-CSWS affects less than 2% of the estimated 470,000 children with active epilepsy in the United States. 
SCN8A-DEE (NBI-921352 – Nav1.6 Sodium Channel Inhibitor). We have initiated the KAYAKTM study, a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of NBI-921352 as adjunctive therapy in 52 adolescent patients (aged 12 to 21 years) with SCN8A-DEE. In January 2022, the study protocol was amended to include pediatric patients (aged 2 to 11 years) with SCN8A-DEE. The FDA has granted us orphan drug and rare pediatric disease designations for NBI-921352 in SCN8A-DEE. 
NBI-921352 is a potent, highly selective Nav1.6 sodium channel inhibitor being developed to treat pediatric patients with SCN8A-DEE and other potential indications, including adult focal epilepsy. We acquired the global rights to NBI-921352 in December 2019. SCN8A-DEE is a rare, extremely severe, single-gene epilepsy caused by mutations in the SCN8A gene that activates Nav1.6, the most highly expressed sodium channel in the excitatory pathways of the central nervous system. Children born with SCN8A-DEE typically start experiencing seizures between birth and 18 months of age, and most have multiple seizures per day. Other symptoms include learning difficulties, muscle spasms, low or high muscle tone, poor coordination, developmental delay and features similar to autism. As SCN8a mutations were discovered only recently, prevalence estimates will be determined in the future as awareness of and access to genetic surveillance increases.
Focal Onset Seizures (NBI-921352 – Nav1.6 Sodium Channel Inhibitor). We have initiated a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of NBI-921352 as adjunctive therapy in 100 adult patients with focal onset seizures. We anticipate having top-line data for this clinical study in 2023.
NBI-921352 is a potent, highly selective Nav1.6 sodium channel inhibitor being developed to treat pediatric patients with SCN8A-DEE and other potential indications, including adult focal epilepsy. We acquired the global rights to NBI-921352 in December 2019. Focal epilepsy is a neurological condition in which the predominant symptom is recurring seizures that affect one hemisphere of the brain. Focal epilepsies are also known as partial-onset seizures and include idiopathic location-related epilepsies, frontal lobe epilepsy, temporal lobe epilepsy, parietal lobe epilepsy and occipital lobe epilepsy. It is estimated that focal onset seizures affect 1.8 million adults in the United States, approximately 35% of whom are refractory to existing treatments.
Neuroendocrinology
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, or CAH.
Classic CAH in Adults (crinecerfont – CRF1 Antagonist). We have initiated the CAHtalyst study, a global, registrational Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of crinecerfont in 165 adult patients with classic CAH, followed by an open-label treatment period. We anticipate having top-line data for this clinical study in 2023.
Classic CAH in Pediatrics (crinecerfont – CRF1 Antagonist). We have initiated a global, registrational Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of crinecerfont in 81 pediatric patients (aged 2 to 17 years) with classic CAH. We anticipate having top-line data for this clinical study in 2023.
We have been granted orphan drug designation for crinecerfont in the treatment of classic CAH in the United States and the European Union. Crinecerfont is a potent, selective, orally active, corticotropin-releasing factor1, or CRF1, receptor antagonist as demonstrated in a range of in vitro and in vivo assays. CRF1 is a hypothalamic hormone released directly into the hypophyseal portal vasculature which acts on the CRF1 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, or GPCR, in the anterior pituitary to stimulate the release of the adrenocorticotropin hormone, or ACTH. The primary role of ACTH is the stimulation of the synthesis and release of adrenal steroids, including cortisol. Cortisol from the adrenals have a negative feedback role at the level of the hypothalamus that decreases CRF1 release as well as at the level of the pituitary to inhibit the release of ACTH. This tight control loop is known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Blockade of CRF1 receptors at the pituitary has been shown to decrease the release of ACTH, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal steroids including androgens, and potentially the symptoms associated with classic CAH. Lower ACTH levels would also reduce the amount of exogenous corticosteroid necessary for classic CAH patients to thrive avoiding the side-effects currently associated with excessive steroid therapy. Corticosteroids are the current standard of care for classic CAH and are used chronically to both correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency and to reduce the excessive ACTH levels and androgen excess. However, the dose and duration of steroid use required to suppress ACTH is well above the normal physiological level of cortisol; resulting in metabolic syndrome, bone loss, growth impairment and Cushing’s syndrome as common and serious side effects. Classic CAH refers to a group of autosomal recessive genetic conditions that result in an enzyme deficiency that alters the production of adrenal hormones. If left untreated, classic CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration and eventually death. Even with cortisol replacement, persistent elevation of ACTH from the pituitary gland results in excessive androgen levels, leading to virilization of females including precocious puberty, menstrual irregularity, short stature, hirsutism, acne and fertility problems. Classic CAH affects an estimated 30,000 people in the United States and 50,000 people in the European Union.
Neuropsychiatry
Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a spectrum of serious neuropsychiatric brain diseases in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily life. People with schizophrenia typically require lifelong treatment. Early treatment may help improve long-term prognosis and get symptoms under control before serious complications develop. Schizophrenia affects an estimated 3.5 million people in the United States. A description of our investigational treatments for potential use in schizophrenia follow.
Adjunctive Treatment of Schizophrenia (valbenazine – VMAT2 Inhibitor). We have initiated a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of valbenazine when administered orally once daily as adjunctive treatment in 400 adolescent and adult patients (aged 13 years and older) with schizophrenia who have had an inadequate response to antipsychotics. We anticipate having top-line data for this clinical study in 2023. 
VMAT2 is a protein concentrated in the human brain that is essential for the transmission of nerve impulses between neurons. VMAT2 is primarily responsible for packaging and transporting monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine) in neurons. Specifically, dopamine enables neurotransmission among nerve cells that are involved in voluntary and involuntary motor control. In psychiatry, disease states such as schizophrenia are characterized in part by a hyperdopaminergic state in the brain and modulation of neuronal dopamine levels may provide symptomatic benefits for patients with this condition, among others. Approximately 30% of the estimated 3.5 million people affected by schizophrenia in the United States fail to respond to current antipsychotic therapy.
Schizophrenia (NBI-1117568 – Muscarinic M4 Agonist). We plan to submit an investigational new drug application and initiate a placebo-controlled Phase II clinical study of NBI-1117568 as a potential treatment for schizophrenia in 2022. NBI-1117568 is a potential first-in-class muscarinic M4 receptor agonist with the potential to be developed for the treatment of schizophrenia. As a selective M4 orthosteric agonist, NBI-1117568 offers the potential for an improved safety profile without the need for combination therapy to ameliorate off-target effects or for cooperativity with acetylcholine. Muscarinic receptors are central to brain function and validated as drug targets in psychosis and cognitive disorders. We acquired the global rights to NBI-1117568 in December 2021. All currently approved antipsychotic medications are believed to work through direct action on monoaminergic receptors, with approximately 40% of patients reporting negative side effects and approximately 30% not benefiting adequately from these medications.
Cognitive Impairment Associated with Schizophrenia, or CIAS (luvadaxistat – DAAO Inhibitor). We have initiated a Phase II randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of luvadaxistat when administered orally once daily as adjunctive treatment in 308 adult patients with CIAS. 
Luvadaxistat is a potential first-in-class D-Amino Acid Oxidase, or DAAO, inhibitor with the potential to be developed for the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. We acquired the global rights to luvadaxistat in June 2020. CIAS, which may include deficits in attention, working memory and executive function, has a negative impact on patients’ quality of life and ability to function. Although cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia are well characterized, no formal diagnostic criteria exist. Furthermore, no pharmacological agents are approved to treat the condition, and no marketed therapy tested to date has established clear, meaningful efficacy, which underscores the difficulty of drug development in this arena and accentuates the unmet need for proven treatment options. Approximately 80% of the estimated 3.5 million people affected by schizophrenia in the United States experience clinically relevant cognitive impairment.
Major Depressive Disorder. Major depressive disorder is characterized by a persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in daily activities that is present most of the day in addition to other symptoms that can impact normal daily functioning, relationships and overall quality of life. Treatments range from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants and psychotherapies, among others. Major depressive disorder affects more than 16 million people in the United States. A description of our investigational treatments for potential use in major depressive disorder follow.
Inadequate Response to Treatment in Major Depressive Disorder (NBI-1065845 – AMPA Potentiator). We have initiated a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NBI-1065845 as adjunctive treatment in 212 adult patients with inadequate response to treatment in major depressive disorder. We anticipate having top-line data for this clinical study in 2023. 
NBI-1065845 is a potential first-in-class Alpha-Amino-3-Hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-Isoxazole Propionic Acid, or AMPA, potentiator with the potential to be developed for the treatment of inadequate response to treatment in major depressive disorder, also known as treatment-resistant depression. We acquired the global rights to NBI-1065845 in June 2020. NBI-1065845 is currently designated as a 50:50 profit-share product with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, which retains a one-time opt-out right to convert the designation to a royalty-bearing product. Major depressive disorder is one of the leading causes of disability. While there are a number of marketed treatments for major depressive disorder, approximately 30% of the more than 16 million people affected by the disorder in the United States do not adequately respond to treatment.
Anhedonia in Major Depressive Disorder (NBI-1065846 – GPR Agonist). We have initiated a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over, Proof of Activity clinical study to evaluate the effects of NBI-1065846 as adjunctive treatment in 88 adult patients with major depressive disorder experiencing anhedonia. We anticipate having top-line data for this clinical study in 2023. 
NBI-1065846 is a potential first-in-class G Protein-Coupled Receptor 139, or GPR139, agonist with the potential to be developed for the treatment of anhedonia in major depressive disorder. We acquired the global rights NBI-1065846 in June 2020. NBI-1065846 is currently designated as a 50:50 profit-share product with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, which retains a one-time opt-out right to convert the designation to a royalty-bearing product. Anhedonia is characterized by the inability to experience pleasure and has been associated with changes in neurotransmitter levels involved in the brain’s reward system. Anhedonia is a core symptom of major depressive disorder and also frequently presents in people with bipolar depression, schizophrenia, substance-abuse disorders, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes and coronary artery disease. 
Business Strategy
Commercializing Our Product Portfolio. We launched INGREZZA in the United States in May 2017 as the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. In September 2020, we launched ONGENTYS in the United States as an FDA-approved add-on treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson's disease experiencing motor fluctuations. Our experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products began with INGREZZA’s approval in 2017, when we hired our salesforce and established our distribution and reimbursement capabilities, all of which are necessary to successfully commercialize our marketed products and products candidates. Our specialty salesforce in the United States consists of approximately 250 experienced sales professionals focused on educating healthcare professionals, including psychiatrists and neurologists, who treat patients with tardive dyskinesia and Parkinson’s disease. In the third quarter of 2021, we announced an expansion of our specialty salesforce, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022, to approximately 350 experienced sales professionals that will establish three dedicated sales teams focused on psychiatry, neurology and providers in long-term care, respectively. Our commercial team is comprised of experienced professionals in marketing, access and reimbursement, managed markets, market research, commercial operations and salesforce planning and management. In addition, our commercial infrastructure includes capabilities in manufacturing, medical affairs, quality control and compliance. We intend to retain commercial rights to certain products, including INGREZZA, that we can effectively and efficiently develop, secure regulatory approval and commercialize, which includes products with a concentrated prescriber base and well-defined patient population that can be accessed with an efficient patient and prescriber outreach program.
Advancing Life-Changing Discoveries in Neurology, Neuroendocrinology and Neuropsychiatry. We believe that by continuing to advance and expand our product pipeline, we can mitigate some of the risks associated with drug development. We currently have multiple programs in various stages of research and development, including symptomatic disease modifying treatments. We take a portfolio approach to managing our pipeline that balances the size of market opportunities with clear and defined clinical and regulatory paths to approval. By doing so, we focus our internal development resources on innovative therapies with improved probabilities of technical and commercial success.

In addition to the potential patent term extensions referenced above, the products and product candidates in our pipeline may be subject to additional terms of exclusivity that we may obtain by future patent issuances.
Separately, the United States, European Union and Japan each provide data and marketing exclusivity for new medicinal compounds. If this protection is available, no competitor may use the original applicant’s data as the basis of a generic marketing application during the period of data and marketing exclusivity, which is measured from the date of marketing approval by the FDA or corresponding foreign regulatory authority. This period of exclusivity is generally 5 years in the United States, 6 years in Japan and 10 years in the European Union, except that for biologics, the period of exclusivity in the United States is 12 years under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. In addition, if granted orphan drug designation, certain of our product candidates, including crinecerfont, may also be eligible for marketing exclusivity in the United States for 7 years and European Union for 10 years.

Manufacturing and Supply
We currently rely on, and intend to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers for the production of INGREZZA and our product candidates. Raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, and other supplies required for the production of INGREZZA and our product candidates are sourced from various third-party manufacturers and suppliers in quantities adequate to meet our needs. Continuing adequate supply of such raw materials and API is assured through our long-term commercial supply and manufacturing agreements with multiple manufacturers and our continued focus on the expansion and diversification of our third-party manufacturing relationships. In addition, we rely on BIAL – Portela & Ca, S.A. for the commercial supply of ONGENTYS.
We believe our outsourced manufacturing strategy enables us to direct our financial resources to the maximization of our opportunities with INGREZZA and ONGENTYS, investment in our internal R&D programs and expansion of our clinical pipeline through business development opportunities.
Our third-party manufacturers, suppliers and service providers may be subject to routine current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions. We depend on our third-party partners and our quality system oversight of them for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution 
Our experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products began with INGREZZA’s approval in 2017, when we hired our salesforce and established our distribution and reimbursement capabilities, all of which are necessary to successfully commercialize our marketed products and products candidates. Our expanded specialty salesforce in the United States will consist of approximately 350 experienced sales professionals divided into three dedicated sales teams focused on psychiatry, neurology and long-term care. We anticipate completing our salesforce expansion during the second quarter of 2022.
For INGREZZA, our customers in the United States consist of a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers that deliver INGREZZA to patients by mail, wholesale distributors that distribute INGREZZA primarily to certain specialty pharmacies, and specialty distributors that distribute INGREZZA primarily to closed-door pharmacies and government facilities. For ONGENTYS, our customers in the United States consist primarily of wholesale distributors. We rely on third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the packaging, storage and distribution of INGREZZA and ONGENTYS.
Government Regulation
Our business activities are subject to extensive regulation by the United States and other countries. Regulation by government authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, distribution, tracking, marketing and sale of our proposed products and in our ongoing research and product development activities. All of our products in development will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In addition, federal and state healthcare laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, without limitation, federal and state fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. We have a comprehensive compliance program designed to ensure our business practices remain compliant.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and the federal civil monetary penalties law, which prohibit among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed and knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or to avoid or decrease an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
In addition, we may be subject to HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their privacy and security regulations, which impose certain obligations, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect individually identifiable health information on covered entities subject to HIPAA (i.e., health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers) and their business associates that perform certain services for or on their behalf involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information as well as their covered subcontractors.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and additional reporting requirements and regulatory oversight, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Development and Marketing Approval for Products. Preclinical studies generally are conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and efficacy of a product. Drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA as a part of an investigational new drug application, or IND, before clinical trials can begin in humans. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three-phase process.

Phase I | Clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetic properties of the product in human volunteers or in patients with the target disease. 
Phase II | Clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. 
Phase III | Larger, multi-center, comparative clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine safety and efficacy as primary support for regulatory approval by the FDA to market a product candidate for a specific disease.

The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the United States and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Institutional Review Boards, Institutional Ethics Committees and Data Safety Monitoring Boards also closely monitor the conduct of our trials and may also place holds on our clinical trials or recommend that we voluntarily do so. Clinical trials conducted in foreign countries are also subject to oversight by regulatory authorities in those countries.
Once Phase III trials are completed, drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA in the form of an NDA for approval to commence commercial sales. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of filing of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. The FDA generally has a six-month review goal of priority NDAs.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 as amended and reauthorized, certain applications or supplements to an application must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The risk evaluation and mitigation strategy could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or additional elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with Good Clinical Practice requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
We will also have to complete an approval process similar to that in the United States in order to commercialize our product candidates in each foreign country. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional testing. Foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the United States The resulting prices may not be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or our corporate collaborators.
In the European Union, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any European Union member state: a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure, identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies. Regulatory review is led by one member state (the reference-member state), and its assessment—based on safety, quality and efficacy—is reviewed and approved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other member states from which the applicant is seeking approval (the concerned-member states). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products of Human Use, or CHMP, adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the European Commission for final decision on grant of the marketing authorization. While the EC generally follows the CHMP’s opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval.
Orphan Drug Designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000, there is no reasonable expectation that sales of the drug in the United States will be sufficient to offset the costs of developing and making the drug available in the United States Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If the FDA approves a sponsor’s marketing application for a designated orphan drug for use in the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the sponsor is eligible for a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, during which the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for a drug with the same active moiety and intended for the same use or indication as the approved orphan drug, except in limited circumstances, such as if a subsequent sponsor demonstrates its product is clinically superior. During a sponsor’s orphan drug exclusivity period, competitors, however, may receive approval for drugs with different active moieties for the same indication as the approved orphan drug, or for drugs with the same active moiety as the approved orphan drug, but for different indications. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for 7 years if a competitor obtains approval for a drug with the same active moiety intended for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that grounds for withdrawal of the orphan drug exclusivity exist, or that our product is clinically superior. Further, if a designated orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received orphan drug designation, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries outside of the United States, including the European Union. The orphan legislation in the European Union is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons, are life‑threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and for which no satisfactory treatment is authorized. The market exclusivity period is for 10 years, although that period can be reduced to 6 years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product does not justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Post-Approval Requirements. Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products.
In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our drug products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our products or product candidates, including INGREZZA, may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective.
Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
The marketability of any product or product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private third-party payor.
There have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, the Trump administration signed several executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, includes a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include, among others, aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect through 2031, except for a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequestration.
Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several Congressional hearings and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products.
For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to drug pricing that sought to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020, providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. This rule is undergoing legal challenge.
Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. This rule has been stayed by the Biden Administration until 2023 while pending litigation is heard in the courts.
On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinds the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. 
Additionally, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of our products and product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than we do.
Competition may also arise from, among other things, new drug development technologies, new or improved treatment options for preventing or reducing the incidence of disease in diseases our products treat and new small molecule or other classes of therapeutic agents. Such developments by competitors could reduce or eliminate the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates.
Tardive Dyskinesia. INGREZZA competes with AUSTEDO (deutetrabenazine), which was approved by the FDA for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in adults in August 2017 and is marketed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and several clinical development-stage programs targeting tardive dyskinesia and related movement disorders. Additionally, there are a number of commercially available medicines used to treat tardive dyskinesia off-label, such as Xenazine® (tetrabenazine) and generic equivalents, and various antipsychotic medications (e.g., clozapine), anticholinergics, benzodiazepines (off-label), and botulinum toxin.
Parkinson’s Disease. ONGENTYS competes with two other FDA-approved COMT inhibitors and their generic equivalents. Additionally, there are a number of alternative adjunctive treatment options (FDA-approved and in clinical development) for Parkinson’s patients which compete with ONGENTYS, including various L-dopa preparations, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors and others. In terms of potential future competition, there are several programs in late-stage clinical development.
Endometriosis and Uterine Fibroids. ORILISSA and ORIAHNN each compete with several FDA-approved products for the treatment of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, infertility and central precocious puberty. Additionally, there is also competition from surgical intervention, including hysterectomies and ablations. Separate from these options, there are many programs in clinical development which serve as potential future competition. Lastly, there are numerous medicines used to treat the symptoms of disease (vs. endometriosis or uterine fibroids directly) which may also serve as competition: oral contraceptives, NSAIDs and other pain medications, including opioids.
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia. For CAH, high doses of corticosteroids are the current standard of care to both correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency as well as reduce the excessive ACTH levels. In the United States alone, there are more than two dozen companies manufacturing steroid-based products. In addition, there are several programs in clinical development targeting CAH and several companies developing medicinal treatments for CAH.
Epilepsy. Our investigational treatments for potential use in epilepsy may in the future compete with numerous approved anti-seizure medications and development-stage programs being pursued by several other companies. Commonly used anti-seizure medications include phenytoin, levetiracetam, brivaracetam, cenobamate, carbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, lacosamide, perampanel and cannabidiol, among others. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments specifically indicated for the early infantile epileptic encephalopathies SCN8A-DEE and EE-CSWS; however, a number of different anti-seizure medications are currently used in these patient populations. 
Neuropsychiatry. Our investigational treatments for potential use in schizophrenia and depression may in the future compete with several development-stage programs being pursued by other companies. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments specifically indicated for CIAS; however, there are a number of different anti-psychotic medications currently used in these patient populations.
Other. Our investigational treatments for potential use in neurology, neuroendocrinology and neuropsychiatry may in the future compete with numerous approved products and development-stage programs being pursued by several other companies.
Human Capital
Our Employees. We have grown to a team of more than 900 employees as of December 31, 2021, all of whom were employed in the United States. Our highly qualified and experienced team, which includes scientists, physicians and professionals across sales, marketing, manufacturing, regulatory, finance and other essential functions are critical to our success. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business needs. During 2021, we added over 200 new employees to our team. 
We expect to continue to add additional employees in 2022 with a focus on expanding our commercial salesforce, research, and development organizations. We continually evaluate our business needs and opportunities and balance in house expertise and capacity with external expertise and capacity. Currently, we rely on third-party contract manufacturers.
Our Culture. The success of our human capital management investments is evidenced by our low employee turnover, a number which is regularly reviewed by our Board of Directors as part of their oversight of our human capital strategy. In recognition of our efforts, in 2021, we received the following rewards:
•#4 in Fortune Best Workplaces in Health Care & BiopharmaTM
•#7 in Fortune Best Small & Medium WorkplacesTM 
•#13 in Fortune Best Workplaces for WomenTM
•#25 in Fortune Best Workplaces for MillennialsTM
Employee Engagement, Talent Development & Benefits. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we also invest in ongoing leadership development programs as well as offer tuition reimbursement. In addition, we regularly conduct an employee survey to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus.
Diversity & Inclusion. Much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. We believe that our business benefits from the different perspectives a diverse workforce brings, and we pride ourselves on having a strong, inclusive and positive culture based on our shared mission and values.
