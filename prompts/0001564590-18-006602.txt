Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a commercial stage company that develops and markets products and services based on proprietary technology that facilitates the routine use of targeted molecular profiling using a small amount of biological sample. Molecular profiling is the collection of information about multiple molecular targets, such as DNA and RNA, also called biomarkers, in a biological sample. Molecular profiling information has many important applications, from basic research to molecular diagnostics in personalized medicine. Our technology can be used throughout that range of applications, which is just one of its many benefits. Our focus is on clinical applications. Our primary customers include biopharmaceutical companies, academic research centers and molecular testing laboratories.
 As part of our business model, we seek to leverage key business drivers in molecular profiling, including the acceleration of precision medicine, the migration of molecular testing to next generation sequencing, the movement to less invasive biopsies, the need for greater diagnostic sensitivity, the need to conform to changing healthcare economics and the need for automation and an easily deployable workflow. Our products include instrumentation (or platforms), consumables, including assay kits, and software analytics that, as an integrated system, automate sample processing and can quickly, robustly and simultaneously profile tens, hundreds or thousands of molecular targets from samples a fraction of the size required by prevailing technologies. Our objective is to establish our solutions as the standard in molecular profiling, and to make their benefits accessible to all molecular labs from research to the clinic. We believe that our target customers desire high quality molecular profiling information in a multiplexed panel format from increasingly smaller and less invasive samples, with the ability to collect such information locally to minimize turnaround time and cost.
 Historically, molecular profiling has faced several technical challenges in clinical applications. These include (i) limited “multiplexing,” which means only a few biomarkers could be tested in a single sample, (ii) the need for significant amounts of sample to test more than a few biomarkers, which often required several different technologies conducted in different locations, (iii) complex sample preparation, and (iv) manual and/or time consuming workflows. Even where it was possible to test tens, hundreds or thousands of biomarkers, such as with fixed arrays, data analysis could be quite complicated and time consuming.
 Our proprietary technology has several key differentiators, including (i) multiplexing from tens to thousands of biomarkers in a single sample, (ii) very low sample input requirements, (iii) simple, extraction-free sample preparation, which is effective with a wide variety of samples including formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (“FFPE”) tissue and liquid biopsies, (iv) automated workflow with sample-to-result turnaround times rivaling any current competitor, and (v) simplified data output. In addition, our HTG EdgeSeq assay technology, launched in 2014, generates a molecular profiling library for detection using NGS instrumentation. Among other things, NGS provides improved sensitivity and dynamic range for our HTG EdgeSeq assays. We believe these advantages position us to outperform most other now-available molecular profiling technologies, especially in certain sample types, such FFPE. While we continue to advance our technology, we are particularly focused on gaining market recognition and expanding our product offerings.
 We currently have two primary sources of revenue: revenue from research use only (“RUO”) profiling for biopharmaceutical companies, academic research centers and molecular testing laboratories; and revenue from collaborative development services for companion diagnostic development programs for biopharmaceutical companies. RUO profiling revenue includes customer purchases of our HTG EdgeSeq instrument and integrated RUO assay kits, and the use of our HTG EdgeSeq instruments and RUO assay kits to process samples on the customer’s behalf in our VERI/O laboratory. Collaborative development services revenue relates to services performed primarily for biopharmaceutical companies pursuant to our Master Assay Development, Commercialization and Manufacturing Agreement (the “Governing Agreement”) with QIAGEN Manchester Limited (“QML”), a wholly owned subsidiary of QIAGEN N.V. Under the Governing Agreement, whereby our HTG EdgeSeq proprietary technology is utilized to develop, seek regulatory approval for and commercialize clinical diagnostic assays for biopharmaceutical drug candidates and corresponding therapeutics.
 Our assay offerings that are currently sold for research use only include the following:
  
• | HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel;

In addition, we have obtained CE-marking for two of our assay offerings in Europe, making the following assay products available for diagnostic use in Europe:
  
• | HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay EU; and
--+----------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq DBLCL Cell of Origin Assay EU.
--+-------------------------------------------

 We continue work on our pre-market approval (“PMA”) submission for our HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay in the United States. We also have a focused development pipeline of new profiling products, which includes planned panels for translational research, drug development, and molecular diagnostics with initial focus in immuno-oncology. Our HTG EdgeSeq EGFR, KRAS and BRAF Mutation Assay is our first commercially available application based on the next generation of our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry.
 Our HTG EdgeSeq assays are automated on our HTG EdgeSeq platform, which may also be referred to as an “instrument” or “processor” and which, together with the assay, is a fully integrated system.
 Customers can obtain the advantages of our proprietary technology by engaging our VERI/O laboratory for pre-clinical and clinical research-related services, including drug development and translational research. Our services include processing samples for molecular profiling data and designing custom research or investigational profiling assays. We also perform collaborative development services for biopharmaceutical company customers, primarily through the Governing Agreement with QML.
 We believe the value propositions of our products and services are gaining significant recognition. In 2016, we entered into an RUO services agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”) and a collaborative development services agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (“Merck KGaA”). In June 2017, we entered into our first statement of work (“SOW One”) under the Governing Agreement relating to a companion diagnostic program for a biopharmaceutical partner, and subsequently entered into two additional statements of work in October 2017 (“SOW Two”) and January 2018 (“SOW Three”), relating to companion diagnostic programs for two additional biopharmaceutical company customers. In December 2017, we entered into a separate RUO services agreement for development and manufacturing of RUO assays supporting biomarker research programs with Merck KGaA. These programs represent just a few of the over 30 individual project programs with biopharmaceutical companies employing our proprietary technology in their clinical research and drug development programs as of December 31, 2017.
 As we navigate product-related regulatory requirements to launch additional molecular diagnostic products, initially in Europe and then in the United States, we expect our RUO products and services will continue to drive market recognition and technology adoption. Further, we believe that strategically positioning our proprietary technology, products and services in drug or other clinical development programs will drive a future, ongoing portfolio of molecular diagnostic products, including companion diagnostic products. 
 Our Strategy
 Our objective is to establish the HTG solutions as the standard in molecular profiling, and to make their benefits accessible to all molecular labs from research to the clinic. The key components of our strategy are:

• | Focus on immuno-oncology based molecular profiling. We plan to develop novel RNA-based gene classifiers to help biopharmaceutical companies and leading translational medicine researchers better understand and predict durable response to immune checkpoint inhibitor drug candidates, such as anti-PD-L1 therapeutics, in mono- and combination therapies. We also plan to develop novel DNA profiling tests (using RNA surrogate assays) that can provide information about mutation load and microsatellite instability, which are genetics factors believed to be associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase and strengthen companion diagnostics collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies. We believe collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies with late-stage drug development programs will lead to us generating companion diagnostic consumables revenue. As of December 31, 2017, we had 37 active development programs across 9 leading biopharmaceutical companies which are incorporating companion diagnostics in their drug development programs. Through our Governing Agreement with QML, we have initiated companion diagnostic collaborative development services for three biopharmaceutical company programs to date, in addition to our existing arrangement with Merck KGaA from 2016. We intend to continue to leverage our VERI/O laboratory services business to enable nimble response to emerging biopharmaceutical molecular profiling requirements.

• | Increase our market adoption by leveraging the advantages of our technology, including low sample input and high sensitivity. We plan to promote global adoption of our proprietary technology in molecular labs, biopharmaceutical companies and major translational research centers by demonstrating the key differentiating aspects of our chemistry and platforms, such as small sample utilization, multiplexing and high sensitivity. These advantages result in cost, time and ease of use benefits for our customers. To facilitate adoption, our VERI/O service laboratory, supports customers who desire additional laboratory capacity, assay design services, and/or to access our service-only content offerings. We also continue to offer our HTG EdgeSeq system and reagents to customers who want to bring our technology in-house.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish our systems workflow as the best solution for clinical sequencing. We intend to continue to establish our technology as the best sample and library preparation method for clinical applications with next generation sequencers. We believe our differentiated HTG EdgeSeq chemistry will accelerate adoption by leveraging the large and growing installed base of next generation sequencers. We are engaged with industry and corporate partners including Illumina, Life Technologies Corporation and QML, to position our HTG EdgeSeq products as the benchmark for workflow in targeted sequencing applications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop new molecular diagnostic panels with high medical utility. Our HTG EdgeSeq platform was developed with features that we believe will enable local molecular labs to routinely test targeted RNA expression, including expressed gene mutations, such as ALK gene rearrangements using our HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay, all from extremely small samples, such as a single five-micron section of FFPE tissue. We plan to develop future molecular diagnostic assays in conformance with existing reimbursement codes to facilitate our clinical customers’ billings. We also plan to work in the major European medical centers to develop and validate certain solid tumor classifiers and lower cost alternatives for breast and prostate cancer testing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the addressable market of HTG technology through new applications. We have demonstrated technical feasibility for several new applications that are intended to allow us to measure DNA mutations directly and in expressed RNA, and improve the already-high sensitivity of our HTG EdgeSeq assays. These new applications are expected to allow us to, among other things, develop future “multi-parameter” panels that detect both RNA and DNA targets in a single assay, for use in translational research, companion diagnostics and molecular diagnostics. We believe these applications and panels can be developed efficiently with reasonable capital investment.

Our Market
 Development of Molecular Profiling
 Molecular profiling is the analysis of biomarkers, including DNA and RNA and protein, in biological samples, such as tissue, cells, blood and other biofluids, to identify gene expression patterns or genomic changes. New molecular approaches are making it possible to perform these characterizations in unprecedented ways, resulting in a shift from the traditional approach of looking at one target at a time to the simultaneous analysis of potentially tens, hundreds or thousands of targets. 
 Among what we believe are the most promising applications of molecular profiling is the targeted sequencing of RNA and DNA from patient samples to identify gene expression patterns or molecular markers of disease that can aid in diagnosis, gauge patient prognosis or predict response to an available therapy. These applications have launched a fundamental shift towards personalized medicine where an individual patient’s molecular profile is used to guide treatment. 
 We estimate that the global cancer profiling market was approximately $30.0 billion in 2017. Based on published industry reports, this market is projected to achieve a value of $87.1 billion by 2023, with a compound annual growth rate of approximately 19.0% between 2017 and 2023. According to these reports, the increase in demand for cancer and tumor profiling products is mainly driven by an increasing number of new cancer cases in an aging population, rising utility of biomarkers in tumor profiling, rising availability of funding for cancer research and increasing demand for next generation sequencing for cancer profiling. Our initial diagnostic products target the pathology related diagnostic markets where we can transition existing testing methods to NGS-based workflows. The companion diagnostic market is currently estimated at $2.6 billion and growing approximately 20% annually. We believe that the acceleration of investment into immunotherapy drugs will also be a catalyst for future companion diagnostics for combination therapies where gene expression classification is expected to be important.
 For decades, the treatment of disease was dominated by one-size-fits-all drug regimens. Over the last 10 years, numerous molecular markers and profiling techniques have transitioned from research tools to inclusion in clinical guidelines for patient care. Oncology drug developers have also seen the benefits of molecular markers and today there are many drugs in clinical development with a companion biomarker strategy.
 Among the vanguard of these personalized treatments were hormone therapies for breast cancer patients whose tumors expressed the estrogen receptor protein. This was followed using trastuzumab for treating patients with HER2-positive breast cancers. This paradigm shift led to significantly improved patient outcomes when compared to the non-specific, chemotherapeutic approaches used in the past.

The evolution of molecular profiling has also taken shape over the last decade in non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). NSCLC patients were first profiled for EGFR gene mutations to select patients most likely to respond to the drug erlotinib. Next came testing for ALK gene rearrangements as an indicator of response to the drug crizotinib. Now, additional mutations and rearrangements such as ROS1, RET, HER2, KRAS and MET, have been integrated into the NCCN guidelines for the treatment of lung cancer and are used to guide patient treatments.
 Similar trends are unfolding in other diseases such as thyroid cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma. These trends are fueling rapid growth of new molecular profiling offerings, technologies and industry business models to support the demand. The fastest growing segment of the molecular diagnostics market, a subset of the global cancer profiling market, is clinical testing in oncology. As oncologists rapidly integrate this new level of molecular profiling information into patient management strategies, a growing number of highly specialized central laboratories now offer tests that address specific clinical questions. The trend towards highly multiplexed profiling is not limited to oncology; other examples of expanding demand include prenatal, neonatal, inherited disease, and organ transplant and rejection profiling.
 Molecular profiling continues to move into clinical applications, including molecular profiling to develop clinical biomarker strategies, patient stratification for clinical trials, and companion diagnostics. The primary goal is to develop an understanding, at the molecular level, about why a drug does or does not work in a patient population. Variability in patients’ gene expression patterns is believed to at least partially explain why the 25% response rate for oncology therapeutics is among the lowest for all disease states. 
 While the primary objective of these drug-development efforts is to improve therapeutic response rates, third-party payor pressures to lower patient treatment costs also plays a significant role. As a result, most biopharmaceutical companies develop biomarker strategies to increase the rate of patient response to new drugs in development. Typically, studies will focus on a variety of biological profiling markers that include RNA or protein expression levels, and/or presence or absence of DNA mutations (such as gene fusions and rearrangements), which can be detected in genomic DNA or expressed RNA or protein. Currently, it is estimated that there are over 2,000 clinical trials underway in oncology, and that the clear majority of drug developers believe personalized and targeted therapy development is important to the future success of drug development.
 When a molecular biomarker panel is used for selection of patients in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a new drug, the drug and biomarker test are often submitted to the applicable regulatory agency for approval together. In the United States, upon U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval of the biomarker test, or companion diagnostic, the patient must be tested with the companion diagnostic prior to treatment with the drug. Companion diagnostic tests have a clear clinical utility which generally supports favorable reimbursement decisions. We believe there are over 900 active oncology drug development programs, most of which have molecular biomarker strategies, creating a significant opportunity for molecular diagnostic companies with the right molecular profiling solutions. 
 Complexities and Challenges of Molecular Profiling Today
 Currently, molecular profiling typically is conducted in the clinical setting using a variety of profiling techniques and instrumentation platforms across multiple laboratory departments, and, in many situations, sent to distant labs. These techniques include immunohistochemistry (“IHC”) fluorescent in situ hybridization (“FISH”) polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) gene expression arrays (“GEA”) and NGS. This distributed profiling approach has accelerated the use of molecular profiling and increased the need to make the process more accessible and routine. However, molecular profiling is also highly specialized because current technologies are complex, require multiple capital-intensive workflows, and are not economically scalable to the case volume of the local laboratory. The fragmentation of methods, sample logistics and information flow has created significant challenges for labs, physicians and patients as discussed below.
Insufficient Sample Availability
 The proliferation of new molecular profiles and technologies has led to the need for more biopsy material to conduct tests of interest. However, the trend is toward less invasive procedures that produce smaller biopsies and thus, in many situations there simply is not enough collected sample to meet all the profiling requirements. For example, historically, the standard method of collecting tumor samples for testing in oncology is via a surgical procedure where the tumor is resected or biopsied and then stabilized, or fixed, in a formaldehyde-based fixative known as formalin. Between 24 to 72 hours after the tissue is removed from the patient, it is permanently stabilized in a hard block of paraffin where it can be stored at room temperature for decades. This preservation technique was developed over 100 years ago, well in advance of the discovery of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. While techniques to recover nucleic acids from these FFPE tissue samples have been developed, formalin fixation presents several technical challenges in analyzing DNA and RNA sequences. Because of the convenience of this preservation method, though, FFPE samples are the starting material for almost all tumor-profiling testing in oncology today.

Most commonly, in the past and continuing today, very thin slices of tissue from FFPE blocks, typically four to six microns in thickness, are affixed to glass slides for testing. Then, a histological stain called an H&E (for the combination of hematoxylin and eosin) is used to differentially mark cellular structures, making it simple for a pathologist to examine the patterns of the normal and diseased tissue under a microscope. IHC stains are also often performed on FFPE tissue slides to aid diagnosis, prognosis or help guide therapy selection, with each IHC stain consuming two slides, one for the stain, and the other for a negative control. Historically, five to ten slides in total were consumed in the complete diagnostic workup for each tumor. With the advent of new molecular techniques there are additional demands for tissue, and most molecular tests on the market today require much more than a single slide. In many clinical situations, there simply is not enough collected tissue to meet all the profiling requirements. The growing number of specialized tumor-profiling tests, and their appetite for FFPE tissue or other sample material, is in direct conflict with the trend towards smaller, less-invasive testing approaches.
 Slow Turnaround Times
 In many cases, turnaround times for comprehensive profiling of a patient’s sample(s) are several weeks due to the logistical time to route samples to various laboratory departments and to distant specialized labs. Several technologies for sample characterization have been used and introduced over the years to determine the status of various molecular characteristics for a sample. These characteristics include RNA and protein expression levels, and/or the presence or absence of DNA mutations, such as single-point mutations and gene fusions and rearrangements, which mutations can be detected in genomic DNA or expressed RNA and protein. A single tumor specimen from a cancer patient is often profiled for multiple molecular characteristics where each characteristic is measured using a different platform. These platforms are utilized in separate laboratory departments or institutions with different technicians and clinicians, requiring that the sample and data be split into multiple workflows. This also requires even more sample consumption.
 The time it takes to deliver the final report to a treating physician so that informed treatment decisions may be made is dependent on the turnaround time of the slowest test. A single laboratory with well-choreographed routing of tissues and information may be able to complete sample profiling within a week, but if part of the sample needs to be sent for additional profiling at a specialty lab, the total turnaround time may be lengthened by one or two weeks due to shipping, accessioning by the receiving laboratory and integration of the testing results into the final report.
 Implications of Workflow Inefficiencies on Data Quality and Integration
 In addition to the challenges of splitting a single sample into multiple testing workflows, the individual workflow for molecular profiling of biological samples, including FFPE tissues, is complicated. Many of the steps from sample to result require manual intervention by a molecular technician. While these technicians are trained to standard operating procedures and proficiency tested, the levels of proficiency and precision vary among technicians. Variability introduced by technicians performing manual steps can translate to variability of results, with a test sample frequently at risk of experiencing losses of fidelity through the series of separation and transformation steps.
 Further, the increase in number of technologies for sample characterization and fragmentation of the testing workflows can also create challenges in putting all the results together in a timely, complete profiling report. This level of data integration is critical for the treating physicians to assure they have the complete molecular assessment prior to consultation with the patient. Without a complete molecular assessment, there is limited ability to discuss the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options. Overall, we believe the critical relationship between the local pathologist and treating physician has been fractured as many tests results are now sent directly to the treating physician from these specialized and centralized Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) laboratories. We believe the pathologist is critical to aggregating the diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information in a single patient molecular profile that can be utilized by the treating physician for therapeutic decisions.
 Our Solution
 We develop and sell assays, automation platforms and services based on a proprietary technology that provides precise, efficient molecular profiling of samples for clinical and research purposes. Our proprietary products and services are designed to work with many different biological sample types, can generate robust results from very small samples, and obviate the need for many of the sample-preparation steps associated with traditional molecular profiling techniques. Our platforms and assays enable the simultaneous detection and quantitation of tens, hundreds or thousands of molecular targets and are capable, now or in the future, of profiling multiple parameters such as RNA expression levels, RNA-expressed gene fusions and insertions and DNA mutations in a single testing workflow that can use NGS detection for quantitative measurement.

We manufacture the consumables utilized with our platforms specifically for our platforms and believe these consumables cannot be obtained from other sources. At the core of our solution is our proprietary chemistry called quantitative nuclease protection (“qNPA”). Our qNPA-based chemistries provide an extremely efficient method for analyzing DNA and RNA as it eliminates the need for DNA or RNA extraction or reverse transcription. We designed and developed our HTG automation platforms to optimize the capabilities of our chemistries, provide fast turnaround time and enable ease of use to molecular labs. Our chemistries and automation platforms are highly adaptable, so when molecular profiling needs change or emerge, we expect to be able to efficiently add new applications to address these needs.
 The HTG systems provide data in a simple easy to use format. The entire workflow for both systems from sample preparation to a molecular profiling report can be accomplished in as few as 36 hours.
 We believe most customers in our target markets would prefer to maintain control of their samples and perform the profiling internally but are challenged by limitations in available technologies. We believe we are well positioned to democratize molecular profiling with the following key benefits:
  
• | Optimize sample utilization. The HTG systems can analyze as many as 2,500 genes from extremely small sample volumes such as a single five-micron section of tissue or 15 microliters of plasma or serum. Our technology allows customers to do more with less, which meets the needs of clinical or pre-clinical laboratories where today there is often not enough patient sample to do all the testing available or desired. We believe providing customers the ability to work with extremely small sample will be a significant driver of adoption of our technology and systems.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compatibility with multiple sample types. Our HTG systems allow customers to profile and unlock molecular information from a wide variety of biological samples such as FFPE tissue, cells, blood serum and plasma. We have successfully demonstrated the ability to profile these and other sample types, and believe we ultimately can profile most clinically relevant sample types, including cell-free circulating nucleic acids from tumors, a rapidly developing area of investigation which is referred to as a liquid biopsy. We believe that the capabilities of our system will allow us to efficiently expand applications, regardless of sample type.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible and adaptable chemistry allows for use in multiple applications. We believe our proprietary chemistry provides the ability to measure a variety of molecular targets in many necessary applications, including RNA expression levels, expressed RNA gene rearrangements (such as gene fusions and insertions), and DNA point mutations, and offers the ability to quantify these applications on a variety of NGS platforms. This flexibility provides customers the ability to optimize their use of our technologies based on their specific throughput, workflow and application needs. Our proprietary chemistry is comparatively simple, with fewer steps than competing technologies. For example, compared to RT-quantitative PCR (“qPCR”) our chemistry does not require extraction or cDNA synthesis. Compared to traditional RNA sequencing, our chemistry does not require extraction, cDNA synthesis, shearing, rRNA depletion, ligation, adenylation, or size selection. We believe that the elimination of these steps helps prevent biases associated with these steps, sample degradation and increased opportunities for technician error.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Robust data. Molecular profiling produces large amounts of information that is used, among other things, to make important decisions, such as identifying potential drug targets or selecting a patient for a therapeutic treatment. This information is valuable only to the extent it accurately represents the true biology of the test sample and the same answer can be produced under many different conditions. Our chemistries are highly specific and sensitive, meaning they can detect the right target even when very little is present in the sample. Our system produces consistent results on a replicate-to-replicate, day-to-day and instrument-to-instrument basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Automation provides superior workflow and ease of use. Our technologies are designed with fewer workflow steps in part due to the elimination of the need for complex sample-preparation processes such as extraction, cDNA synthesis, labeling, selection, depletion and shearing. This enables customers to limit hands-on time and the need for specialized skills, resulting in turnaround times of approximately 36 hours. Additionally, our HTG EdgeSeq system further integrates sample preparation for targeted sequencing and greatly simplifies the data bioinformatics, so customers looking to leverage their NGS instrument can seamlessly add this capability to their current workflows.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simplified bioinformatics. Our software provides data in a simple and easy to use format through a simple graphical user interface (“GUI”) that is flexible enough for researchers yet structured enough for clinical laboratories. The HTG EdgeSeq parser software, which processes the data from the NGS platform, is modular so that new applications can be downloaded without any changes to hardware. We believe the simplicity of our bioinformatics solution will help drive the adoption of our platform.

Our Technology
 HTG EdgeSeq Chemistry
 Our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry is shown schematically in the following figure. Specifically, DNA nuclease protection probes, or DNA protection probes, which include a target-specific region flanked by universal wing sequences are hybridized to targeted RNAs. Target RNA can be both soluble and cross-linked in the biological matrix. Universal DNA wingmen probes are hybridized to the wings to prevent S1 nuclease digestion. S1 nuclease is added to remove single-stranded nucleic acids, including unhybridized DNA protection probes and RNA. Following S1 nuclease treatment, the only remaining DNA protection probes in the reaction are those hybridized to targeted RNA and wingmen probes to form a hybridized complex. This produces an approximately 1:1 ratio of DNA protection probes to the RNA targeted in the sample. Alkaline hydrolysis of the hybridized complexes releases the DNA protection probes from such complexes. The released DNA protection probes are ready for quantitation. DNA protection probes are labeled with sequencing adaptors and tags in a thermocycler. The labeled DNA protection probes are concentrated, pooled, and ready for sequencing using standard NGS protocols. Data from the NGS instrument is processed and reported by the parser software provided with the HTG EdgeSeq system.
 
Key Advantages of our HTG EdgeSeq Chemistry
  
• | Multiplexing tens, hundreds or thousands of targets. Measuring multiple genes in a single reaction can be challenging with competitive technologies due to the complex interactions of reaction components. While we are currently marketing a panel with our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry that can profile up to 2,560 genes in a sample, we believe we can develop applications using our chemistry for multiplexing more than 2,560 genes if there is a customer need. The high level of gene multiplexing allows for significantly lower amounts of tissue to be used per sample than in competitive low-plex profiling technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No RNA extraction. Competitive technologies for assessing RNA generally require RNA that is isolated and purified from other components found in the sample. These time-consuming steps may lead to some target loss and bias the test outcome. In FFPE tissues, for example, it has been reported that a fraction of the RNA is lost in the purification process because it cannot be separated from insoluble tissue components and the fixation and embedding process or long storage times for FFPE tissue may damage the RNA and break it into smaller, more difficult to analyze fragments. This makes molecular profiling of small FFPE tissues particularly challenging and can result in testing failures and loss of precious samples due to insufficient RNA recovery. These biases introduced by RNA extraction cannot be overcome and may be magnified throughout the subsequent analysis. Our proprietary chemistry does not require RNA extraction for FFPE samples or most other sample types (we recommend extracting RNA from fresh-frozen tissue samples to prevent processing variability), improves utilization of precious samples, improving workflow and reducing costs by eliminating a step known to bias the data.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | No cDNA synthesis. Many competitive technologies, most prominently qRT-PCR and traditional RNA sequencing, require conversion of RNA into DNA for analysis. This process, called reverse transcription, requires an enzyme to move along the extracted RNA to create a DNA copy of the molecule. When damaged and fragmented RNA is used, these small RNA strands become increasingly difficult to convert into DNA in an accurate and reproducible manner. Our proprietary chemistry does not require conversion of the RNA to DNA by reverse transcription, removing a technical difficulty experienced with competitive technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Short protection probes. Many samples contain RNA degraded by various combinations of heat, age, poor processing, and fixation. In these samples, the RNA is damaged and fragmented into smaller strands. Utilizing short protection probes of 50 bases or less, we believe our proprietary chemistry is more efficient than competitive technologies that require longer strands of RNA for quantitation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simplicity. Our proprietary chemistry is simple, with fewer steps than competing technologies. Compared to RT-qPCR, our chemistry does not require extraction or cDNA synthesis. Compared to traditional RNA sequencing, our chemistry does not require extraction, cDNA synthesis, shearing, rRNA depletion, ligation, adenylation, or size selection. We believe that the accumulation of these steps required by other technologies results in amplification of biases, sample degradation and increased opportunities for technician error.

The HTG EdgeSeq platform (shown above) consists of a processor, a host computer and integrated software. The processor is a fully automated instrument that prepares biological samples for quantitation using proprietary, electronically barcoded, single-use consumables. The processor has barcode scanner units to process the two-dimensional barcodes printed on the consumables loaded into the instrument. The barcoded consumables are single-use in order to reduce operator errors and provide chain of custody traceability for the samples. The robotic systems within the instrument are engineered for reliable performance and low maintenance. The walking path of the robot is programmed to minimize any chance of contamination of the reagents or samples. One host computer supports up to six processors allowing laboratories to easily expand their capacity by adding processors.
 Applications of our HTG EdgeSeq technology combine the HTG EdgeSeq processor with a NGS platform to enable the quantitative analysis of tens, hundreds or thousands of targeted RNAs in a single panel. The sample is prepared for quantitation on the processor, then labeled with molecular sequencing adaptors and tags. The labeled samples are concentrated, pooled, and sequenced on a NGS platform using standard protocols. Data from the NGS instrument are processed and reported by the parser software included with the system. HTG EdgeSeq assays currently are available to process sample batches ranging from eight to 96.
 In addition to direct sales of our systems, we utilize several alternative arrangements to sell our systems. Our platform can be purchased directly by our customers, who also then purchase HTG EdgeSeq assays and other consumables from us on an as-needed basis. In some instances, we provide our instruments free of charge on a limited basis to facilitate customer evaluation. We also may choose to install instruments for our customers at no cost, in exchange for an agreement to purchase assays and other consumables from us at a stated price over the term of the agreement, or allow customers to rent our instrument for a monthly fee. As of

December 31, 2017, we had an installed base of 44 instruments (consisting of 31 systems sold, two covered under reagent rental agreements, six evaluation units and five systems with key opinion leaders) and an additional three instruments installed at third party sites in support of companion diagnostic collaboration projects.
 Current Commercial Panels Offered on the HTG EdgeSeq Platform
 We currently market proprietary molecular profiling panels targeting late stage drug development programs with potential breakthrough therapies, such as immuno-oncology. We market these panels to biopharmaceutical companies, with which we collaborate in biomarker development programs. We believe these programs could facilitate our commercialization of companion diagnostic tests. In addition, our panels are used in pre-clinical and clinical research areas, which, we also believe, will facilitate our commercialization of diagnostic tests, including tumor classifiers and prognostic tests. Our currently marketed panels are:
  
• | HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel. This RNA expression panel measures the expression of up to 2,560 genes implicated in cancer for profiling tumor tissues, analyzing cancer pathways and identifying new biomarkers across both solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms. We worked with key opinion leaders to identify the genes in this panel, which we believe is a comprehensive list of genes targeting known signaling pathways and receptor gene families implicated in cancer. Representative genes in this panel include EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4, PD-1 and FGFR. When paired with our HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole-Transcriptome Assay (below), we provide customers with a comprehensive solution for profiling their large sample archives for novel expression signatures.

• | HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay. One of the most promising areas of cancer therapy is immunotherapy or immuno-oncology, where new classes of oncology drugs are thought to enable or boost the host immune response towards tumors. Multiple drugs targeting the genes CTLA4, PD-1 and PD-L1 are on market with additional candidates moving into late-stage trials. Profiling samples for the genes targeted by these therapies may be predictive of drug response and aid in the stratification of patients into responsive and non-responsive groups. The HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay measures the expression of 549 of these immuno-oncology-associated genes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay. DLBCL tumors are frequently classified into either the activated B-cell like (“ABC”) or germinal center B-cell like (“GCB”) sub-types by measuring the molecular profile of the tumor. These two subtypes display different clinical pathologies, as patients with the GCB subtype of DLBCL tend to respond differently than those of the ABC sub-type. With many of the large number of new DLBCL-targeting drugs appearing to have greater efficacy in one of the sub-types, a need for a reliable, FFPE-based cell of origin classification assay has emerged. The HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay is being utilized in numerous late-stage drug programs to stratify these patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq PATH Assay. The HTG EdgeSeq PATH Assay has been designed for retrospective gene expression profiling (“GEP”) to compliment traditional immunohistochemistry (“IHC”) testing by allowing investigators to assess mRNA expression of 470 targets when tissue availability is limited. The assay enables a wide variety of applications, including pre-screening of samples to guide subsequent testing and development of novel gene signatures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole-Transcriptome Assay. Human microRNAs are short non-coding strands of RNA that are believed to be used by the cell for gene regulation. The HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole-Transcriptome Assay enables the simultaneous profiling of 2,083 microRNAs, allowing new, potentially clinically relevant miRNA profiles to be discovered. Our ability to efficiently profile small FFPE samples is a significant differentiator in the rapidly growing microRNA market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay EU. The HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay EU is an in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) assay that uses GEP to determine the cell of origin (“COO”) subtype of DLBCL tumors from FFPE tissue section. The gene expression data are assessed by a classification algorithm and the tumor samples are determined to be of the ABC, GCB or unclassified subtype. This product has obtained CE-marking in Europe where it is available for diagnostic use. It is not for sale in North America.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay EU. The HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay EU is an IVD NGS-based assay sold in the EU intended to measure and analyze mRNA ALK gene fusion events in FFPE lung tumor specimens from patients previously diagnosed with NSCLC. This product has also obtained CE-marking in Europe where it is available for diagnostic use. It is not for sale in North America.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq EGFR, KRAS and BRAF Mutation Assay (VERI/O lab service offering exclusively). The HTG EdgeSeq EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF Mutation Assay is an RUO assay currently available exclusively as a VERI/O laboratory service and detects 23 mutations in EGFR, KRAS and BRAF from a 5 µm section of FFPE tissue. Retrospective analysis of the tumor’s mutational status may help researchers understand the tumor response to targeted therapy. This assay is extraction-free and can be used with small samples such as a needle core biopsy.

Opportunities for Comprehensive Molecular Profiling in Diagnostics
 We are planning to develop a portfolio of molecular diagnostic products using our proprietary technology to provide a single, efficient testing system for sample profiling that integrates seamlessly into a customer’s NGS testing workflow. 
 We are initially focused on areas where the diagnostic testing paradigm has significant inefficiencies. For example, many leading medical institutions are shifting from a single-drug / single-test approach to a broader tumor profiling strategy for their oncology practices. Rather than testing for single mutational analyses, such as KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer, these institutions use their NGS platforms to assess the mutational status of 50 or more genes. In addition, the information a physician needs to make clinical decisions often comes from tests conducted using various testing modalities such as IHC, FISH and NGS. These complexities lead to a growing and unmet demand in clinical diagnostics for more comprehensive molecular profiles that can include RNA expression, RNA fusions and rearrangements, DNA mutations and protein expression.
 We are developing solutions to address the detection and measurement of gene rearrangements such as gene fusions and insertions. A fusion gene is a hybrid gene formed from two previously separate genes. A well-established example is the EML4-ALK fusion gene found in a subset of malignant lung cancers. Our research team previously demonstrated feasibility to simultaneously detect and measure key gene fusions in lung cancer such as ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 from multiple small sample types including FFPE, cell lines and purified RNA. An insertion is the addition of one or more nucleotides into a genomic sequence; a small percentage of NSCLC exhibit HER2 exon 20 insertions. 
 We are currently developing our HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay (“ALKPlus Assay”) as our first clinical diagnostic test for the U.S. market. This test panel is in clinical study phase and three of the four PMA modules have been submitted to the FDA. We completed the CE marking of the HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay EU in Europe in March 2017, and currently expect to obtain FDA pre-market approval for the ALKPlus Assay in mid-2018 though prioritization of other diagnostic programs for customers may cause this expected timeline to be adjusted. The intended use for the ALKPlus Assay, if approved by the FDA, will be as a companion diagnostic for crizotinib therapy for ALK positive NSCLC cases. Information on the ROS1, RET, NTRK1 and HER2 gene rearrangements included in the ALKPlus Assay panel will be provided with RUO status. After obtaining the appropriate exemption(s), we believe the ROS1, RET, NTRK1 and HER2 gene rearrangements detected with the ALKPlus Assay could also be used for investigational use only (“IUO”) for certain late-stage drug development trials, and, as appropriate, receive FDA approval in the future.
 Ultimately, we believe that HTG technology can bring multiparameter testing to a wide variety of solid tumor sample types. We will need to develop, refine and implement new panel protocols and make changes or adjustments to our chemistry and software to optimize these planned applications and panels for use with our HTG EdgeSeq system. This will require substantial effort from our research scientists and the use of various laboratory equipment, supplies and materials, which combined represent the most significant costs that we expect to incur in connection with the development of these applications and profiling panels.
 We are leveraging our platform to develop comprehensive molecular profiling panels across an increasing set of molecular applications, with initial focus in immuno-oncology and next generation pathology. In conjunction with our biopharmaceutical collaborators, we plan to develop novel RNA-based gene panels and possibly classifiers that can provide information about inflammation signatures and the molecular classification of tumors. Separately, we also plan to develop novel RNA-based gene panels designed for expanded applications in immune health monitoring and prescreening, detection of hyper-progression and predicting patient response to combination therapies. We believe that we will need to develop, refine and implement new panel protocols and make changes or adjustments to our chemistry and software to optimize these planned applications and panels for use with our HTG EdgeSeq system. We expect this to require substantial effort from our research scientists and the use of various laboratory equipment, supplies and materials, which together represent the most significant costs that we expect to incur in connection with the development of these applications and profiling panels.
 Serving the decentralized markets with Project JANUS
 In addition to continued menu expansion for clinical diagnostic products we have begun the development of our next generation instrument targeting the lower throughput clinical market. We refer to this development program as Project JANUS. We believe the lower throughput clinical market will potentially increase our addressable market for instrument sales from hundreds to thousands of labs. The molecular testing market is served by a mix of centralized reference laboratories, comprehensive cancer centers, and decentralized regional hospital laboratories. Volumes of particular case types and downstream testing needs for solid tumors are somewhat unpredictable for these providers. We believe Project JANUS is well suited for managing low, medium, and surge testing volumes; thus, assisting our customers with this unpredictable aspect of their businesses. We anticipate testing panels for Project JANUS to include mutations, fusions, expression classifiers and a molecular surrogate for IHC. Our approach is to serve centralized markets with the HTG EdgeSeq system and expand to the decentralized market with Project JANUS. We believe our current HTG EdgeSeq system has the throughput capabilities that match the needs of the centralized market. Project JANUS is our planned approach to expand our addressable market to the lower sample throughput labs and further decentralize the market. Due to various research and development priorities, Project JANUS development efforts were put on hold during the third quarter of 2016. We intend to resume development efforts in accordance with development prioritization.

Research and Development
 We have committed, and expect to commit, significant resources to developing new technologies and products, improving product performance and reliability and reducing costs. We have assembled an experienced research and development team with the scientific, engineering, software and process talent that we believe is required to successfully grow our business. As of December 31, 2017, our research and development team consisted of 30 employees across the disciplines of research and development scientist, platform development and bioinformatics.
 Our development team is responsible for clinical assay development services being performed for biopharmaceutical company customers in accordance with our Governing Agreement with QML. We believe these programs have the potential to generate future revenue through the sale of HTG EdgeSeq instruments and test kit annuities associated with a successfully approved clinical diagnostic as the related drug gains adoption. Our research efforts are currently focused on the expansion of our technology into new immune-oncology applications as well as other applications in solid and liquid biopsies, while working to continuously improve assay performance and probe design.
 Sales and Marketing
 We distribute our instruments and consumables via direct sales in the United States and Europe and also through distributors in parts of Europe and other countries. As of December 31, 2017, our U.S. sales and marketing organization consisted of 23 employees including 12 in direct sales or sales management, five in sales support and six in marketing. In addition to our direct sales team in the United States, as of December 31, 2017, we had five direct sales and support employees in Europe and distribution agreements in several additional countries. This sales model provides us with direct sales coverage in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and the Nordic countries, with distributors in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Israel.
 Our sales and marketing efforts target biopharmaceutical companies, clinical research centers and clinical diagnostic labs focused on sample profiling for translational research, biomarker/companion assay development and lab-developed diagnostic testing. We intend to promote adoption of our HTG EdgeSeq system, sample profiling panels and future molecular diagnostic assays upon marketing clearance or approval by the FDA, by expanding our U.S. sales force, building a greater direct sales presence in Europe, expanding international distribution and continuing to collaborate with key opinion leaders to validate our platform and to influence utilization of our products.
 Our top two customers accounted for 54% and 8% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 29% and 12% for the year ended December 31, 2016. QML was our largest customer for the year ended December 31, 2017 with approximately $7.9 million of collaborative development services revenue recognized for work performed for two precision diagnostic programs under our Governing Agreement.
 Manufacturing and Suppliers
 We primarily perform manufacturing and final acceptance testing in house. External resources are leveraged for their specific expertise in either producing components for our HTG EdgeSeq instrument and raw materials for our consumables in accordance with our designs, or based on their catalog products which are utilized as is within our designs. We manufacture HTG EdgeSeq instruments and reagent kits at our Tucson, Arizona facility, which has been certified to ISO 13485:2003 standards. We believe that our existing manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our needs at least for the next several years.
Instruments
 We assemble our HTG EdgeSeq instruments at our Tucson, Arizona facility. We have qualified an alternative third-party manufacturer for our instruments and we believe additional instrument manufacturing alternatives would be available if necessary. Instrument component vendors are qualified and reviewed regularly to ensure that manufacturing standards are met and maintained. We award contracts for estimated annual quantities of components and, considering the replenishment lead times of our vendors, take delivery of batches covering approximately one month of demand at a time. 
Consumables
 We assemble our HTG EdgeSeq consumables at our Tucson, Arizona facility. Raw material vendors are selected using precise standards, and are reviewed regularly for compliance with our specific quality requirements. We purchase raw material stock in quantities that often exceed projected annual demand. We complete batches of finished goods approximating quarterly demand and supervise inventory on a minimum/maximum basis to ensure that we are replenishing our finished goods and raw material ahead of demand.

 Agreements with Third Parties
 Asset Purchase Agreement with NuvoGen Research, LLC
 We entered an asset purchase agreement dated January 9, 2001, as amended in November 2003, September 2004, November 2012 and February 2014, with NuvoGen Research, LLC (“NuvoGen”) to acquire certain intellectual property from NuvoGen. The acquired technology generally relates to our former array-based nuclease protection panels. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, in exchange for the acquired technology, we initially paid NuvoGen 5,587 shares of our common stock, fixed payments of $740,000 over the first two years of the agreement and, thereafter, agreed to pay NuvoGen the greater of $400,000 per year or 6% of our annual revenue, until the total aggregate cash compensation paid to NuvoGen under the agreement equals $15,000,000. Pursuant to the latest amendment to the agreement, we paid NuvoGen annual fixed fees of $800,000 and $543,750, in quarterly installments, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although the amendment allowed for the deferral of any accrued revenue-based payments through December 31, 2017, no revenue-based payments were deferred, and revenue-based payments of $85,574 and $0 were payable as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for the amount by which 6% of revenue exceeded the applicable fixed fee. Beginning in 2018, we are obligated to pay the greater of $400,000 or 6% of sales. As of that date and continuing until the remaining obligation has been paid in full, interest on the remaining unpaid obligation will accrue and compound annually at a rate of 2.5% per year. Accrued interest on this unpaid obligation is payable on the date that the remaining obligation is paid in full.
 In a transaction related to the foregoing acquisition, NuvoGen also received a non-exclusive, royalty free license under the acquired technology pursuant to an agreement dated September 15, 2004. The license is limited to NuvoGen’s own internal service-oriented efforts and activities to accelerate the development of targeted drugs and other pharmaceutical compounds and agents as part of NuvoGen’s grant funded or other basic research and development of drugs intended for the treatment of cancer.

Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford Finance, LLC and Silicon Valley Bank
 On August 22, 2014, we entered a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Growth Term Loan”) with Oxford Finance LLC (“Oxford”) as collateral agent (the “Agent”) and a lender and Silicon Valley Bank, as a lender (“SVB” and together with Oxford, the “Lenders”) providing for up to two separate term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 million.
 We borrowed the initial term loan in the principal amount of $11.0 million (“Growth Term Loan A”) on August 22, 2014. Growth Term Loan A bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.50% per annum. On or prior to June 30, 2015, the Loan Agreement allowed us to borrow one additional term loan (“Growth Term Loan B”) for up to $5.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain borrowing conditions. We received Growth Term Loan A proceeds, net of a $320,000 original issue discount, with a requirement to pay a final payment of 3.75% of the total amount borrowed.
 In August 2015, the Company and its lenders amended the Growth Term Loan to extend the availability of Growth Term Loan B until March 31, 2016. Pursuant to such amendment, we made monthly interest-only payments until April 1, 2016. Following the interest-only payment period, equal monthly payments consisting of principal and interest amortized over the remaining term of the loan through the September 1, 2018 maturity date are due. The amendment also increased the final fee payment percentage to 4.75%. In February 2016, the Company notified its lenders, pursuant to the requirements of the amendment to the Growth Term Loan, of its intention to draw the remaining $5.0 million available under Growth Term Loan B. This additional principal will be repaid evenly over the course of 30 months beginning April 1, 2016 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.75%. The final fee premium relating to Growth Term Loan B of $237,500 is being amortized to interest expense, using the effective interest method, over the term of Growth Term Loan B.
 We may prepay all, but not less than all, of the loaned amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the prepayment date with 15 days’ notice to Oxford. In accordance with the August 2015 amendment, we will be obligated to pay a prepayment fee equal to 1% of the principal amount repaid if the loan is repaid prior to the September 1, 2018 maturity date. We are not entitled to reborrow any amounts of principal once such principal has been repaid. The agreement was again amended in June 2016 to modify the definitions of permitted indebtedness and permitted liens to provide for an increased maximum amount of permitted indebtedness, authorize a new category of permitted indebtedness and authorize a new category of permitted liens. 
 While any amounts are outstanding under the credit facility, we are subject to several affirmative and restrictive covenants, including covenants regarding delivery of financial statements, maintenance of inventory, payment of taxes, maintenance of insurance, dispositions of property, business combinations or acquisitions, incurrence of additional indebtedness and transactions with affiliates, among other customary covenants. We are also restricted from paying cash dividends or making other distributions or payments on our capital stock except for repurchases of stock pursuant to employee stock purchase plans, employee restricted stock agreements, stockholder rights plans, director or consultant stock option plans, or similar plans, provided such repurchases do not exceed $100,000 in the aggregate per fiscal year.
 We granted the Agent a security interest in our personal property to secure our obligations under the Growth Term Loan. The security interest does not extend to patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights (except for rights to payment related to the sale, licensing or disposition of such intellectual property rights) or certain other specified property. If we default under our Growth Term Loan, our lenders could foreclose on our assets, including substantially all of our cash, which is held in accounts with our lenders. 
 Upon the occurrence of certain events, including but not limited to the failure by us to satisfy our payment obligations under the loan agreement, the breach of certain of our other covenants under the loan agreement, and the occurrence of a material adverse change, the Agent will have the right, among other remedies, to declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable, and will have the right to receive the final payment fee and, if the payment of principal and interest is due prior to maturity, a prepayment fee. The Agent also will have the right, among other remedies, to foreclose upon and/or sell or otherwise liquidate our personal property upon the occurrence of certain events.
 Warrants granted to each of the Lenders in connection with Growth Term Loan A are exercisable until August 22, 2024 and were automatically converted to warrants for common stock upon completion of our initial public offering in May 2015. In connection with the funding of Growth Term Loan B, in March 2016, we issued Oxford an additional common stock warrant exercisable for 45,307 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.759 per share, and the warrant previously issued to SVB automatically became exercisable for an additional 5,317 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $23.51 per share in accordance with the Growth Term Loan.

Development and Component Supply Agreement with Illumina, Inc.
 In June 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Development and Component Supply Agreement with Illumina, Inc. (“Illumina”), effective May 31, 2017 (the “Restated Agreement”), which amended and restated our IVD Test Development and Component Supply Agreement originally entered into with Illumina in October 2014 (the “Original Agreement”). The Restated Agreement provides for the development and worldwide commercialization by the Company of nuclease-protection-based RNA or DNA profiling tests (“IVD test kits”) for use with Illumina’s MiSeqDx sequencer in the field of diagnostic oncology testing in humans (the “Field”).
 Under the Restated Agreement, the parties have agreed to continue activities under the first development plan which was entered into pursuant to the Original Agreement relating to our HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay. In addition, we may, at our discretion, submit additional development plans for IVD test kits in the Field to Illumina for its approval, not to be unreasonably withheld.
 Under each development plan, Illumina will provide specified regulatory support and rights, and develop and deliver to us an executable version of custom software, which, when deployed on Illumina’s MiSeqDx sequencer, would enable sequencing by the end-user of the subject IVD test kit probe library. Illumina retains ownership of the custom software, subject to our right to use the custom software in connection with the commercialization of IVD test kits. In addition to fees paid in 2015 under the Original Agreement, we are required to pay Illumina up to $0.6 million in the aggregate upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones relating to the IVD test kits, though none of these regulatory milestones have been reached through December 31, 2017. We have also agreed to pay Illumina a single digit percentage royalty on net sales of any IVD test kits that we commercialize pursuant to the Restated Agreement.
 We submitted two additional development plans for IVD test kits to Illumina in the second and fourth quarters of 2017. Following receipt of the custom software module for the first of these test kits, we paid Illumina $50,000, which is included in our statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. No payments were made to Illumina during the year ended December 31, 2016 under this agreement. Ongoing research and development costs for development plans under the Restated Agreement have been expensed as incurred.
 Absent earlier termination, the Restated Agreement will expire in May 2027; however, Illumina is no longer obligated to notify us of changes in its products that may affect our IVD test kits after May 31, 2023. We may terminate the Restated Agreement at any time upon 90 days’ written notice and may terminate any development plan under the Restated Agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice. Illumina may terminate the Restated Agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice if we undergo certain changes of control, subject to a transition period of up to 12 months for then-ongoing development plans. Either party may terminate the Restated Agreement upon the other party’s material breach of the Restated Agreement that remains uncured for 30 days, or upon the other party’s bankruptcy.
 Authorization, Supply and Regulatory Authorization Agreement with Life Technologies Corporation
 In March 2016, we entered an Authorization, Supply and Regulation Authorization Agreement with Life Technologies Corporation (“LTC”) a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., for the development and worldwide commercialization by us of up to five RNA-based NGS panels (“HTG Assays”) for use with LTC’s sequencing instruments and components supplied to end‑users by LTC.
 Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to obtain our requirements for certain components to be used in the development of HTG Assays from LTC. In March 2016, we purchased approximately $250,000 of LTC products and equipment in accordance with this agreement. LTC has agreed to provide support in our efforts to obtain regulatory approval of the HTG Assays. We are required to pay LTC a milestone payment in the mid-six figure dollar range upon certain regulatory achievements for each HTG Assay. In addition, we have agreed to pay LTC a single digit percentage royalty on net sales of HTG Assays that we commercialize pursuant to the agreement. No milestone or royalty payments have been accrued or made pursuant to this agreement as of December 31, 2017.
 Absent early termination, the initial term of the agreement will expire in March 2021 and thereafter will automatically renew for additional two year periods for as long as we continue to develop or sell HTG Assays, provided that neither party provides written notice of its election to terminate the agreement at least 60 days prior to expiration of the then-current term. Either party may terminate the agreement (a) upon the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 30 days, (b) upon the other party’s bankruptcy or (c) upon written notice in the event the party providing notice reasonably determines that continued performance under the agreement may violate any regulatory law, or any other applicable law or regulation or FDA guidance.
 Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Agreement 
 In May 2016, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with BMS for the development of custom RUO assays for BMS based on our HTG EdgeSeq technology. Following development of each custom RUO assay, at BMS’s request, we may also perform sample processing services using such custom RUO assay(s) and/or supply the custom RUO assay(s) to BMS or its third-party subcontractors. 
 16


Additional development related to immuno-oncology research may be undertaken pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement in accordance with a mutually acceptable work plan, which is incorporated by written amendment.
 BMS paid an initial non-refundable, non-creditable program set-up fee, and has agreed to pay an annual non-refundable, non-creditable project management fee in quarterly installments, as well as a fee for each assay developed. Each such fee was or is in the low six-figure range. At BMS’s request, we will supply custom RUO assay kits and perform sample processing services.
 The agreement will expire on May 11, 2019 or, if a project is then ongoing, the date of delivery of the final report for such project. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s material breach or default in the performance of a material obligation under the agreement or if certain warranties or representations are untrue in any material respect, either a default, and such default remains uncured for 60 days or such longer period if the default cannot be cured within 60 days. BMS may terminate a project upon 90 days’ prior written notice.
 Merck KGaA Agreements
 Master CDx Agreement
 In October 2016, we entered a Master CDx Agreement with Merck KGaA to serve as the basis for one or more project agreements to develop, seek regulatory approval for, and commercialize companion diagnostic assays for Merck KGaA drug candidates and corresponding therapeutics. Concurrently, we entered into a first project agreement under the agreement concerning our sequencing-based DLBCL cell of origin assay (“DLBCL Assay”) and Merck KGaA’s investigational drug, M7583 (the “Project”).
 The Project has three stages aligned with timelines and outcomes of M7583 development. The timing of our development activities and payments may be affected by the M7583 development timing and activities which is controlled by Merck KGaA. During stages 1 and 2, we have agreed to perform specified DLBCL Assay development activities. In stage 3, we have agreed to seek to obtain applicable regulatory approvals on the DLBCL Assay and make it commercially available in the United States and certain other jurisdictions.
 Stages 2 and 3 each have an up-front payment, and all stages of the Project have milestone-based payments. We are eligible to receive up to a total of $9,900,000 over a period of approximately nine years in fixed or determinable contract consideration comprising up-front and milestone payments. In addition, during stages 1 and 2 of the Project, we will sell DLBCL Assay kits and/or perform sample processing services upon request of, and as instructed by, Merck KGaA. 
 Merck KGaA may terminate the Project or any other project agreement by providing three months’ prior written notice, at which point Merck KGaA will be required to reimburse us for certain costs incurred during the termination period, and we will be required to reimburse Merck KGaA for any costs that have been prepaid without being incurred prior to termination. Further, either party may also terminate the agreement or a project agreement upon the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 60 or 45 days, respectively, or upon the other party’s bankruptcy. 
 Master Collaboration Agreement
 In December 2017, we entered into a Master Collaboration Agreement for translational research programs with Merck KGaA. The Master Collaboration Agreement complements the Master CDx Agreement with Merck KGaA and includes a statement of work with EMD Serono, the U.S. biopharmaceutical affiliate of Merck KGaA.
 Under the first statement of work, we plan to develop and manufacture a custom profiling assay to support biomarker research for six indications within Merck KGaA’s drug development pipeline. The assay is expected to be kitted for use on HTG EdgeSeq instruments acquired by Merck KGaA and/or their contract research organization partners. 
 QIAGEN Agreements
 Governing Agreement
 In November 2016, we entered the Governing Agreement with QML. The Governing Agreement creates a framework for the companies to combine their technological and commercial strengths to offer biopharmaceutical companies a complete NGS-based solution for the development, manufacture and commercialization of companion diagnostic assays. Under the Governing Agreement, the parties jointly seek companion diagnostic programs with biopharmaceutical companies, QML enters into sponsor project agreements with interested biopharmaceutical companies for specified projects, and we and QML enter into statements of work, that set forth the rights and obligations of each party with respect to each project.
 17


The parties’ relationship under the Governing Agreement is exclusive in the oncology field. Such exclusivity in the oncology field may be lost and become non-exclusive if certain performance targets are not met. Projects may be undertaken in non-oncology fields at each party’s discretion on a non-exclusive basis.
 We and QML share net profits under each statement of work, at a percentage that primarily depends on which company’s intellectual property forms the basis for the particular assay under the applicable statement of work. Each statement of work provides additional financial terms for the corresponding project, which terms depend on the respective development and/or commercialization activities of the parties.
 The Governing Agreement has a five-year term. However, either party may terminate the Governing Agreement upon (i) the other party’s uncured material breach, bankruptcy or insolvency, (ii) specified events affecting all statements of work, or (iii) a change of control by either party, except neither party will have such change of control termination right to the extent the Governing Agreement relates to SOW One, SOW Two or SOW Three (each defined below). In the event a party terminates the Governing Agreement for its own change of control, a $2.0 million termination payment will be payable to the non-terminating party.
 Stock Purchase Agreement
 Pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, entered concurrent with the Governing Agreement, QIAGEN North American Holdings, Inc. (“QNAH”) another wholly owned subsidiary of QIAGEN N.V., purchased 833,333 shares of our common stock on November 17, 2016 at $2.40 per share, for a total purchase price of $2.0 million. The purchase price for the shares of common stock purchased by QNAH on November 17, 2016 reflected the parties’ agreement as to the fair market value of the shares as of the closing. However, the portion of the purchase price per share that exceeded the most recently reported closing price of our common stock, or $175,000 in the aggregate, was attributed to the Governing Agreement and recorded as deferred revenue to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the Governing Agreement’s five-year term. No additional shares of our common stock were purchased by QNAH in the second tranche closing allowed for in this agreement and QNAH had no further obligation to purchase our common stock under the stock purchase agreement as of December 31, 2017.
Statement of Work No. One
 In June 2017, we entered into the first statement of work (“SOW One”) under the Governing Agreement with QML. SOW One addresses the initial activities to be performed by us and QML in support of the development and potential commercialization of a NGS-based companion diagnostic assay that is the subject of a sponsor project agreement between QML and a biopharmaceutical company (“Pharma One”). The parties expect development activities for the assay to be the subject of more than one work plan under the sponsor project agreement and a corresponding number of statements of work under the Governing Agreement.
 QML pays us a monthly fee for development work performed by us and our subcontractors. We also will share any net profits resulting from performance of the development work as determined pursuant to the Governing Agreement. Such profit sharing payment(s) is deemed to be fixed or determinable upon completion of SOW One deliverables, acceptance of corresponding deliverables by Pharma One, and the mutual agreement by QML and us on the calculation of net profit. 
 SOW One will expire when all activities and deliverables have been completed by the respective responsible party and all payments from QML to us have been delivered, including any required profit sharing, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the Governing Agreement. 
 Contemporaneous with entry into SOW One, the Governing Agreement was amended to provide that neither party may terminate SOW One or the Governing Agreement to the extent it relates to SOW One in the event of a change of control.
 Statement of Work No. Two
 In October 2017, we entered into SOW Two under the Governing Agreement with QML. SOW Two was made effective as of June 2, 2017 (“Onset Date”). SOW Two addresses development activities conducted by us and QML since the Onset Date and those expected to be further conducted by parties in connection with a sponsor project agreement between QML and BMS (the “BMS/QML SPA”).
 The development work performed and expected to be performed by us and QML under SOW Two (“Initial Phase Work”) is expected to form the basis of a multi-stage project leading to the potential development and commercialization of a companion diagnostic assay in support of one or more of BMS’s therapeutic development and commercialization programs. SOW Two will expire upon completion of the Initial Phase Work and receipt by us of all amounts due for such work, which we believe will occur in mid-2018 barring any unexpected project delays. QML will pay us mid-single digit millions of dollars for the Initial Phase Work 
 18


performed by us under SOW Two. In addition, we will share in any net profits (as determined under the Governing Agreement) generated by the Initial Phase Work with QML on an approximately quarterly basis throughout the term of SOW Two.
 SOW Two also provides that, notwithstanding anything in the Governing Agreement to the contrary, neither party shall have the right to terminate SOW Two or the Governing Agreement to the extent it relates to SOW Two upon a change of control of either party.Concurrently with SOW Two, as a condition to BMS’s approval of SOW Two, we entered into a Supplement Agreement with QML and BMS, made effective as of the Onset Date. The Supplement Agreement establishes certain rights and obligations of the parties with regard to confidential information and other intellectual property needed to perform, and/or produced as a result of, the Initial Phase Work. We will receive sole ownership of certain improvements (as specified in the Supplement Agreement) that may be produced as a result of the Initial Phase Work, and have agreed to grant certain royalty-free, non-exclusive license rights to our technology in the event of a project delay caused by us and to certain patent rights we may obtain as a result of the Initial Phase Work. In addition, we will have joint ownership of certain other results of the Initial Phase Work, and royalty-free, non-exclusive license rights to BMS- or QML-owned (solely or jointly) patents resulting from the Initial Phase Work. The Supplement Agreement will expire or terminate upon expiration or termination of the BMS/QML SPA, which is expected to be approximately coextensive with the term of SOW Two.
 Statement of Work No. Three
 In January 2018, we entered into SOW Three under the Governing Agreement with QML. SOW Three relates to development activities for a NGS-based clinical-trial assay (“SOW Three Project”) in connection with a sponsor project agreement between QML and a pharmaceutical company (“Pharma Three”). If successfully completed, SOW Three Project is expected to lead to subsequent assay development activities and the potential commercialization of a companion diagnostic assay for a corresponding Pharma Three drug.
 QML has agreed to pay us low, single-digit millions of dollars in development fees for the SOW Three Project, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018. In addition, we and QML will share any net profits (as determined under the Governing Agreement) generated by the SOW Three Project on an approximately quarterly basis over the term of SOW Three.
 Under the terms of SOW Three, we have agreed to assign our rights in certain SOW Three Project‑related intellectual property (“Project IP”) predominantly related to Pharma Three’s drug candidate(s) to QML for ultimate assignment to Pharma Three in accordance with the project agreement. Improvements to the respective background intellectual property of the parties generally will be owned solely by the respective party. Otherwise, Project IP will be jointly owned among us, QML and Pharma Three.
 Pursuant to the terms of SOW Three, if Pharma Three terminates the project agreement or the SOW Three Project due to our uncured material breach of SOW Three, we will be required to negotiate in good faith with Pharma Three a non‑exclusive, royalty‑bearing license to certain of our intellectual property as reasonably necessary for Pharma Three to research, develop, and commercialize an in vitro diagnostic assay meeting the same specifications as in SOW Three.
 Neither we nor QML have the right to terminate SOW Three or the Governing Agreement to the extent it relates to SOW Three upon a change of control of either party. In addition, if Pharma Three terminates the project agreement or the SOW Three Project for an uncured material breach that is directly caused by our or QML, then, for the non‑breaching party, the exclusivity obligation of the Governing Agreement will terminate solely with respect to the development for Pharma Three and/or its affiliates of an in vitro diagnostic assay meeting the same specifications as in SOW Three.
 SOW Three expires upon completion of the SOW Three Project and receipt by us of all amounts due for such work.
 QNAH Convertible Note Agreement
 In October 2017, we issued a subordinated convertible promissory note (the “QNAH Convertible Note”) to QNAH in the principal amount of $3.0 million against receipt of cash proceeds equal to such principal amount. The QNAH Convertible Note bears simple interest at the rate of 3.0% per annum and matures on October 26, 2020. Our indebtedness under the QNAH Convertible Note is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the prior repayment in full of our indebtedness under our Growth Term Loan. QNAH may elect to convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal balance of the QNAH Convertible Note and all unpaid accrued interest thereon at any time prior to the maturity date into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $3.984 per share.
 Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 Clinical laboratories will acquire our instrumentation through a capital purchase, capital lease or reagent purchasing agreement. These laboratories will offer their customers a menu of testing services using our IVD test kits or their LDTs, which they may develop 
 19


using components they purchase from us, or a combination of both. Our customers will generate revenue for these testing services by collecting payments from third-party payors, including public and private payors, as well as patient co-payments.
 United States
 In the United States, molecular testing laboratories have multiple options for reimbursement coding, but we expect that the primary codes used will be the Genomic Sequencing Procedure codes. We are also monitoring the Protecting Access to Medicare Act implementation as well as the recent National Coverage Determination for NGS testing by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”).
Genomic Sequencing Procedures.
 The AMA created codes for Genomic Sequencing Procedures (“GSPs”) and other Molecular Multianalyte Assays as part of its calendar year 2015 update to the clinical laboratory fee schedule. AMA has since modified the GSP codes to clarify the definition to include DNA and RNA. Our customers may use these codes to seek reimbursement for diagnostic multi-analyte test offerings, such as:

• | Gene expression classifiers for hematolymphoid neoplasms, such as the determination of ABC or GCB subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gene rearrangements in solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutations in solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 Payments for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Molecular Pathology Procedures and GSPs may be sought from both public and private payors. Claims for Medicare coverage are processed by private Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) such as Novitas and Cahaba, and coverage for specific test codes are specified in Local Coverage Determinations (“LCDs”) issued by individual MACs or National Coverage Determinations (“NCDs”) which apply to all MACs. Private payors issue their own coverage determinations that are largely reflective of the CMS LCDs and NCDs. HTG closely monitors trends in coverage through interactions with customers, industry associations such as the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (“AMP”) and industry consultants; these trends are key considerations in our product development plans.
 Our customers may use our products, if approved, and subject to regulatory limitations, to offer testing services that provide an analysis of 5‑50 genes as well as 51 or more genes. In October 2014, CMS released its preliminary determinations regarding the method for determining 2015 payment rates for new codes under the clinical laboratory fee schedule. CMS recommended that payment rates for GSPs be determined through a process known as gapfill rather than by crosswalking to allow CMS and its contractors to gather information about the manner in which the tests are performed and the resources necessary to provide them, so that ultimately CMS can set an appropriate payment rate for these tests. In the gapfill process, the local MACs determine the appropriate fee schedule amounts in the first year, and CMS calculates a national payment rate based on the median of these local fee schedule amounts in the second year. On September 22, 2017, gapfill pricing for CPTs 81445 and 81450 for the assessment of 5-50 genes in solid and liquid tumors, respectively, were set at $598 and $760, respectively, and remains the same as of December 31, 2017. CPT 81455 for the assessment of 51 or more genes in solid and liquid tumors was set at $2,920.
 We believe that establishment of the aforementioned reimbursement codes specific to genomic sequencing procedures such as our clinical diagnostic tests currently in development is an important factor in expanding access to our products. In addition, coverage and reimbursement of our clinical diagnostic tests by government and private payors is essential to our commercial success. Accordingly, our strategy includes efforts to encourage third-party payors to establish coverage, coding and payment that will facilitate access to our tests as we seek FDA approval for these tests and expand our commercialization efforts in the United States. Our success in these efforts depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for tests using our technology. Failure by our customers who use our tests to obtain coverage and sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payors or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ policies would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects.
 Outside the United States
 Our target markets outside of the United States are Europe and Asia/Pacific. Our diagnostic product menu plans for Europe and Asia/Pacific consist primarily of NGS‑based test kits that will satisfy existing or emerging testing demand, and we expect to be competing based on testing efficiency, quality and price. 
 20


In Europe, coverage for molecular diagnostic testing is varied. Countries with statutory health insurance (e.g., Germany, France, The Netherlands) tend to be more progressive in technology adoption with favorable reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing. In countries such as the United Kingdom with tax-based insurance, adoption and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing is not uniform and is influenced by local budgets.
 Failure by our ex-U.S. customers to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our diagnostic products from healthcare payors or adverse changes in government and private payors’ policies would have a material adverse effect on our ex-U.S. growth prospects and our overall business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Government Regulation – Medical Device Regulations
 United States
 Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign authorities. Currently we are limited to marketing our products in the United States for research use only, which means that we cannot make any diagnostic or clinical claims. However, we intend to seek regulatory clearances or approvals in the United States and other jurisdictions to market certain assays for diagnostic purposes. The clinical diagnostics under development by HTG are classified as “medical devices” under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of such products for their intended use.
 Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA submission can be expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
 Device Classification
 Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes – Class I, Class II or Class III – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
 Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
 Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and post market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the statute, to either:
  
• | a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
 21


After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s). In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements.
 The PMA Process
 If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
 Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally costlier and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical study data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
 In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical studies intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) application. Some types of studies deemed to present “non-significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and Institutional Review Board approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical studies. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical studies for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical study sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical studies, and although the FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
 Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If the PMA application is determined to be sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g. major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory panel may be convened to review the PMA and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. This advisory panel may also involve a public meeting if FDA determines public input is required. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical study data and clinical study sites, and a QSR inspection of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
  
• | the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical studies may be insufficient to support approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


 
• | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, which usually contains several conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional analytical studies or clinical studies are necessary, in which case approval of the PMA submission may be delayed for several months or years while the analytical studies and/or trials are conducted and data are submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
 New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modification to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
 In approving a PMA application, the FDA may also require some form of post market studies or post market surveillance, whereby the applicant follows certain patient groups for several years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. FDA may also require post market surveillance for certain devices cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside a device user facility. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:

Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.
 Research Use Only
 An RUO product is one that is not intended for clinical diagnostic use and must be labeled “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” Products that are intended for research use only and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA requirements discussed above, including the approval or clearance and QSR requirements. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDC Act and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed, when determining its intended use.
European Union
 The European Union (“EU”) has also adopted requirements that affect our products. These requirements include establishing standards that address creating a certified quality system as well as several directives that address specific product areas. The most significant of these currently effective directives is the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (“IVDD”) which includes:

• | Essential Requirements. The IVDD specifies “essential requirements” that all medical devices must meet. The requirements are similar to those adopted by the FDA relating to quality systems and product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conformity Assessment. Unlike United States regulations, which require virtually all devices to undergo some level of premarket review by the FDA, the IVDD currently allows manufacturers to bring many devices to market using a process in which the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the essential requirements for that device. A small number of products must go through a more formal pre-market review process. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the EU and European Economic Area.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vigilance. The IVDD also specifies requirements for post market reporting similar to those adopted by the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On May 26, 2017, the EU released a new regulatory framework, the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (“IVDR”) which is expected to replace IVDD. Our products in the EU will have to comply with the IVDR requirements after May 26, 2022. Until that time, our products must continue to meet the requirements of IVDD for commercialization in the EU. 
 Other International
 Several other countries, including Australia, Canada, China and Japan, have adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for medical devices sold in those countries. Many of these standards are loosely patterned after those adopted by the European Union, but with elements unique to each country. Although there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards, regulations in each country may vary substantially, which can affect timelines of introduction. We routinely monitor these developments and address compliance with the various country requirements as new standards are adopted.
Government Regulation – Fraud and Abuse and Other Healthcare Regulation
 We may be subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback laws. Penalties for violations of these healthcare laws include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service, or for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending, any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal 
 24


healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term “remuneration” expressly includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value.
 There are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These statutory exceptions and safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, (collectively the “ACA”) to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the intent to induce referrals need only be “one purpose” of the remuneration for violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act which is discussed below.
 Federal Civil False Claims Act
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from or approval by the Federal Government. Suits filed under the federal civil False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers”, may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a case brought under the federal civil False Claim Act. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Many comparable state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the Federal Government.
Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition
 We are also subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits, among other things, physicians who have a financial relationship, including an investment, ownership or compensation relationship with an entity, from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to the entity for designated health services, which include clinical laboratory services, unless an exception applies. Similarly, entities may not bill Medicare, Medicaid or any other party for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all third-party payors, not just Medicare and Medicaid.
Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
 The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person or entity who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
 The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) created several additional federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, governing the conduct of specified electronic 
 25


healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. Among other things, HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The EU has established its own data security and privacy legal framework, including but not limited to Directive 95/46/EC (“Data Protection Directive”). The Data Protection Directive will be replaced starting in May 2018 with the recently adopted European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, higher sanctions and extra-territoriality measures intended to bring non-EU companies under the regulation. Over time we may expand our business operations to include additional operations in the EU. With such expansion, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation, including the GDPR, in the EU countries in which we operate.
 The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act
 The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians, as defined above, and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in significant civil monetary penalties.
State Law Equivalents
 Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, as well as laws that restrict our marketing activities with health care professionals and entities, and require us to track and report payments and other transfers of value, including consulting fees, provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Some states mandate implementation of compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws. We also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws, which vary by country. We may be subject to certain state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, President Obama enacted the ACA, which is substantially changing healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and is significantly impacting the medical device industry. The ACA’s provisions of importance to our business include, but are not limited to, a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, which became effective January 1, 2013. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, signed into law in December 2015, includes a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax that applies between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017. Further, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018, the 2018 Appropriations Resolution, that extended the moratorium on the medical device excise tax through December 31, 2019. Absent further legislative action, the tax will be automatically reinstated for medical device sales beginning January 1, 2020.
 Since its enactment in 2010, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provision of the ACA and otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, the 2018 Appropriations Resolution delays the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including, without limitation, the medical device excise tax.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, following the passage of other legislative amendments, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the 
 26


American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 The full impact of the ACA, its possible repeal, and any legislation passed to replace the ACA, as well as other laws and reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may continue the downward pressure on medical device pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Employees
 Our ability to retain current talent and recruit new employees into our Company is a critical factor in our continued growth and performance improvement. We continue to initiate programs to promote our organizational culture and to identify the best possible new talent as the organization grows and new positions are made available. As of December 31, 2017, we had 94 full-time and four part-time employees, of which 12 are employed in administration, 22 in manufacturing and operations, 30 in research and development, six in regulatory and quality affairs, and 28 in s
ales and marketing. We had five employees in Europe as of December 31, 2017, all others were in the United States. We believe that our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties and believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions. Collective bargaining is established by law in France. We and our French employees have agreed to the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.
