History
 
GHST World Inc. (“Ghost” or the “Company”) was organized on November 12, 1999 as a Nevada corporation. On December 2, 2002, the Company merged with and into I.A. Europe, leaving I.A. Europe as the surviving corporation and on April 8, 2008, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name. From 2002, Ghost was a shell corporation with no assets, revenues or operations until January 2008 when it acquired rights to an advertisement filtration system for televisions. It subsequently abandoned that business and became a shell corporation again until 2020 when it entered the sports technology industry when it obtained the rights to a patent for Smart Shin Guard technology.
 
On June 10, 2009, our registration statement was revoked for failure to file reports required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the “Exchange Act”). On September 7, 2010, we re-registered our common stock, and on September 6, 2013 we terminated our registration.
 
On September 21, 2017 we changed our name to “GHST World, Inc.” On March 9, 2021 we filed a registration statement on Form 10 (File No. 000-31705), as amended on April 4, 2021 and May 7, 2021 (the “Form 10”) to register our common stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The Form 10 as amended became effective on May 8, 2021.
 
Current Status
 
On April 3, 2019 we formed GHST Sport Inc. (“Ghost Sport”) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and shifted our business focus to the marketing and sale of technologically-enhanced sports equipment and the acquisition and development of related intellectual property. To that end, on June 30, 2020 we obtained a U.S. patent for our Smart Shin Guard. We also have patent applications pending in Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, and 36 countries in Europe.
 
On June 29, 2019, the Company acquired all of the capital stock of GHST ART WORLD Inc., a Florida corporation (“Ghost Art”), whose principal assets consisted of 119 art paintings and reproductions.
 
We currently have minimal assets other than our patented technology and are relying on the ability to raise the necessary capital to exploit the patent we acquired to the Smart Shin Guard for the United States, and the pending applications in other jurisdictions. We plan to market and sell this product to athletes, sports teams, organizations and leagues, with an initial focus on professional and amateur soccer (football) teams and leagues, both within the U.S. and abroad.

We have not yet generated initial revenue from any of our current products, and have relied upon issuances of shares of our common stock and related party loans to fund our operations. We continue to develop our Smart Shin Guard and related technology, including a smart phone application, as more particularly described below.
 
Our management and directors are based in Italy and other European countries. We have no employees.
 
Acquisition of Intellectual Property Rights to the Smart Shin Guard
 
In 2018, the Company acquired the rights to the 2015 Italian patent and underlying concept for the Smart Shin Guard in exchange for 2,000,000 shares of common stock. The Company has since been issued a U.S. patent (Patent No. US 10,695,651 B2; “Protection Device for Carrying Out Sports Activities Usable in Data Analysis and Monitoring System, and Relative System and Method for Processing and Calculating the Sent Data”) for the Smart Shin Guard and has patent applications pending in Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and the European Union (36 countries) as well as for an international patent. 
 
The patent and patent applications contemplate potential application of the invention within other forms of athletic equipment outside of shin guards used in soccer or similar sports. We may consider expanding our technology to other applications of the invention in the sporting world depending on the results our efforts to market and sell the Smart Shin Guard.
 
The Smart Shin Guard
 
The Smart Shin Guard is a shin guard, which is a form of protective equipment placed on the front portion of the lower leg while playing soccer and similar sports, combined with our data collection and analysis technology that monitors players’ individual and collective physical and performance-based metrics and transmits this information to a separate module in real-time. Examples of the information the Smart Shin Guard can collect and analyze for users is covered distance, acceleration, kicking force, collision impact, positioning, directional movement, and performance alerts. This information will vary depending on the version of the product that is used, which will depend on the customers and their particular purposes for using the Smart Shin Guard.
 
The product is designed for use by teams and individuals to enhance their ability to track player performance, stamina, and conditioning at matches, practices or any other circumstance in which they desire to play the sport. We believe the Smart Shin Guard will provide valuable insight to players, coaches and organizations seeking to gain a competitive advantage over their opponents be assisting with in-game monitoring and pre- and post-game assessment and strategy using our technology. Our goal is to empower coaches, players and teams to make faster and potentially in-game decisions regarding their players, team and strategies in reaction to the data provided and obtain an advantage therefrom that helps them achieve their objectives, both individually and in the leagues in which they compete. Additionally, we believe this product has attractive features for more casual players seeking to track their individual performances for educational, informational, or health-related purposes.
 
Product Development
 
The Company has completed the Beta testing of the functionality of the Smart Shin Guard is now in the industrial development phase which involves a focus on further development of the electronic component (including miniaturization and a proper arrangement), having the software for data collection and transmission and adding artificial intelligence to assist with precision and repeatability.
 
We are continuing to collect data on the functionality of our Smart Shin Guards. We expect to complete the development phase of the Smart Shin Guard in approximately four or five months, whereupon we intend to begin the manufacturing process through a third party and then the sales process, which will initially be focused on non-professional players (teams and individuals).
  
In connection with our development efforts for the Smart Shin Guard, in calendar year 2021 we entered into two agreements with independent contractors which provide for the development, testing and improvement of prototype software, which are summarized as follows:

In January 2021, we entered into an agreement with a third party electronic device development and manufacturing firm providing for the development of an artificial intelligence software component for our Smart Shin Guard. The independent contractor had previously assisted with the development and production of a prototype for the hardware component for the Smart Shin Guard, specifically a pair of shin guards which contain sensors for data collection and accompanying Bluetooth transmission technology. The artificial intelligence software component contemplated by the agreement is intended to allow for more accurate and reliable data collection, analysis and transmission. The agreement contemplates the production of machine learning models aimed at enhancing the product’s data analysis functionality, with data collection and basic analysis using sensors to occur in-game, and more advanced analysis to occur post-game. Under the agreement, this phase of the development process is projected to last two months. The development agreement contemplates that the deliverables under the agreement will allow for future in-house operation by the Company. Further testing, analysis and development under this agreement remains ongoing.
 
In February 2021, we entered into an agreement with another independent contractor for the development of mobile and website applications to be used in conjunction with the Smart Shin Guard and the information and analysis it provides. The agreement contemplates the development of necessary features for these applications, including data transmission and display, user interfacing and notifications. We recently received the initial deliverables under this agreement with respect to the mobile phone application and are in the process of further testing and preparing for consumer use, pending completion of other aspects of the Smart Shin Guard development process described elsewhere in this Report. For more information on these features, see “Applications and Uses.” .
 
Applications and Uses
 
We plan to sell two versions of the Smart Shin Guard which will vary in terms of sophistication of features offered and target demographics of users:
Consumer Kit
 
The standard version which collects data and provides analysis on basic physical and performance metrics, including covered distance, instantaneous and average speed, movement and direction, acceleration and deceleration, kicking power, shot, pass, tackle, and header identification, and performance alerts. The consumer kit is designed for athletes at all levels ranging from casual players to amateur and professional athletes. The remote access to the information and analysis provided can be accessed by coaches, teammates, friends and family. We expect for the development of the consumer kit, including the corresponding smart phone application, to be completed before the more advanced professional kit described below.
Professional Kit
 
An advanced version which will be more sophisticated in terms of the types of data collected and the level of analysis and computation. In addition to the statistics available with the consumer kit, the professional kit allows users to collect information on calorie consumption, metabolic power, elevation distance, directional changes and angles, heart rate, positioning map, and team barycenter, which is the center of gravity of a game. The professional kit is designed for and will be marketed primarily toward professional athletes and teams. The development of the professional kit will be a longer process than the consumer kit due to factors including increased sophistication and technical complexity of the data collection and analysis capabilities, contractual terms and limitations in our human and capital resources.
Smart Phone Application
 
The Company is in the process of developing a smart phone application (“phone app”) for use by customers using the Smart Shin Guard. The phone app will function by receiving and displaying data collected and processed by the Smart Shin Guard. When developed, the phone app will be essential for use in connection with the consumer kit, to the extent such consumers intend to review and use the data provided in real time while training or playing in games. We have developed a prototype of the phone app for the consumer kit, and development for the professional kit, as well as additional continued efforts to improve the application generally, remain ongoing.

Other Subsidiaries
 
Other than Ghost Sport, we have two other subsidiaries which we expect to play a less central role to our business plan and future operations, at least in the short term. These subsidiaries are still in the early developmental stages and we do not expect either to materially contribute to our business plan and operations as described elsewhere in this report. If we find investors or strategic partners interested in either of these subsidiaries, we may enter into agreements or arrangements with such parties pursuant to which we will issue equity or debt interests in the Company or one of our subsidiaries. Below is a brief description of each subsidiary.
Ghost Art World Inc.
 
Ghost Art is our wholly-owned subsidiary which we acquired on June 29, 2019 together with its portfolio of 119 art paintings and reproductions as its principal assets. We have not sold any of these assets. We are also developing a virtual artist “incubator” and art trading platform and network to assist emerging artists increase their visibility and locate and procure sales of their artwork to consumers. This concept is still in the early development stage and we do not expect to bring it to market or generate revenue therefrom in the short term.
IoTT World, Inc.
 
IoTT World Inc. (“IoTT”), which is an acronym for “Internet of Things Tech,” is our wholly-owned subsidiary which focuses on the research and development of technology and products designed to connect common household and other electronic devices using the Internet. This concept is still in the early development stage and we do not expect to bring it to market or generate revenue from it in the short term.
 
Meanwhile, for IoTT we plan to insert a database sector in which all the data collected per user of those who buy and wear our SSGs will converge, so that they can be consulted, for a fee, by insiders such as coaches, athletic trainers, technical sports directors, and others involved with the player/team, or by the players themselves, thus creating a large sports database with the hopes that over time the system will be used for all sports.
 
Competition
 With respect to Ghost Sport, we will compete directly with sports equipment and apparel developers, wholesalers and retailers, as well as other businesses offering player and team tracking technology, some of which sell similar products to ours, and many of which have significantly greater capital and human resources than we do. For example, we face competition from other businesses which provide smart data tracking and collection technology in the form of wearable sporting equipment, including Soccerment and TibTop, each of which offers wearable shin guards, and Catapult Sports, which offers similar wearable devices, with some level of data collection, analysis and transmission functionalities. Although we believe our Smart Shin Guard technology to be unique in terms of its patented features and processes and the depth of information it can collect, analyze and transmit, there can be no guarantee that our competitors have not or will not develop and sell technology that is similar or superior to ours and/or that will hinder or limit our ability to access the market. Further, with respect to the phone app for the Smart Shin Guard, there is at least one other similar application called Goalon which allows users to track certain performance metrics directly on their cellular device, and there may be others currently in the market or that are being or may be developed that we will compete with. Additionally, some sporting equipment companies and service providers offer technology or services using different means, such as cameras that collect and transmit team and player data in a manner similar to ours, could be seen as competitors. Offerings of similar equipment and technology to our Smart Shin Guard by any of these competitors will likely create a barrier to market entry for our product and/or render it difficult to develop or grow a customer base, particularly to the extent our potential customers and users have already integrated competitor products and services. Further, while we are not aware of similar wearable devices that are approved by soccer leagues for in-play usage, we have also not obtained such approval for the Smart Shin Guard ourselves, and there can be no assurance that such approval will be obtained.
 
With respect to Ghost Art, we expect to face competition from niche art platforms and galleries as well as larger platforms on which artists can display their works, such as Instagram and Facebook. Among our more direct competitors in the artist accelerator and marketing platform businesses are Looklateral, Koones, Lean Artist, Mecenate.online, Rise Art and Saatchi Art. Many of our competitors in this field have access to greater financial resources and business networks and more experience in the industry, which will pose challenges to any future operations and barriers to market entry and growth.

With respect to IoTT, a variety of technology research and development companies have already made headway on connecting various devices and otherwise making life easier for consumers using the internet and artificial intelligence. The market is currently saturated with such products, and with companies seeking to develop and evolve such products and underlying concepts as to enhance their functionality. In light of these market conditions and the intense competitive environment in this area, competition will be intense, as will risks inherent therewith including the reality that many competitors have more capital, experience and progress with respect to their offerings than we do and that we may face difficulty in obtaining or protecting intellectual property rights or avoiding the infringement of others in our operations of IoTT.
  
Employees
 
We currently have no employees. Our officers provide services on a part-time basis.
 
Status as an Emerging Growth Company
 
Because we have no revenues and have never had a registration statement become effective, we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company is defined as a company which had annual gross revenues were less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year and had not sold common equity securities under a registration statement as of December 8, 2011. We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the Company during which we had total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the Company following the fifth anniversary of the date of the Company’s first sale of common equity securities of pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (iii) the date on which the Company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which the Company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
 
The federal securities laws and regulations provide certain exemptions for emerging growth companies with respect to financial information and disclosure requirements in registration statements and periodic reports and certain activities in connection with initial public offerings. The exemptions available to us as a result of our status as an emerging growth company are summarized as follows:
 

· | Unlike other reporting companies, we are not required to hold periodic shareholder voting on executive compensation, the frequency of shareholder voting of executive compensation, and golden parachute compensation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We are permitted to include less extensive narrative disclosure in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) than is required of other reporting companies, particularly in the description of executive compensation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We are not required to include a report of our independent registered public accounting firm on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in our SEC filings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We would not be required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (e.g., those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective and do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We would be exempt from any requirement adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in the future providing for a mandatory rotation of companies’ accounting firms.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We are permitted to submit a registration statement under the Securities Act to the SEC on a confidential basis if the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before we were to conduct any road show with respect to such offering.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | We may communicate with prospective investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited investors to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after filing a registration statement under the Securities Act.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some of the above-described exemptions are also available to smaller reporting companies, and therefore a termination of our status as an emerging growth company would not necessarily result in a requirement that we comply with the default disclosure requirements applicable to reporting companies generally.
 
We have elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the Exchange Act.
