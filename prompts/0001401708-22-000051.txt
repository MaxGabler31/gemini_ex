Item 1. Business
Overview
NanoString develops, manufactures and markets technologies that unlock scientifically valuable and clinically actionable information from minute amounts of biological material, primarily for life science researchers in the fields of genomics and proteomics. Our mission is to provide a portfolio of solutions that allow our customers to map the universe of biology, enabling scientific discoveries that can improve the human condition. 
Our technologies include proprietary chemistries that enable the labeling and counting of single molecules. Our product platforms are used for scientific and clinical research applications, often in connection with pharmaceutical product development and human clinical trials of potential new therapies. Our customers include leading biopharmaceutical laboratories and academic and government research institutions. We currently offer two commercially available product platforms, our nCounter Analysis System, or nCounter, and our GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, or GeoMx DSP, system. We have one additional product platform under development, our CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager, or CosMx SMI, system. All NanoString product platforms include instruments, related consumables, software and services.
Every living organism has a genome that contains a full set of biological instructions required to build and maintain life. A gene is a specific set of instructions embedded in the deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, of a cell. For a gene to be “turned on,” or “expressed”, a cell must first transcribe a copy of a portion, or sequence, of its DNA code into molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid, or RNA. Then, the cell translates the expressed information contained in RNA into proteins that form the building blocks of organisms and biological processes.
The decoding of the human and other genomes, and the generation of large amounts of genetic information, or gene sequence data, have led researchers to seek to understand which genes among the decoded sequences may be expressed at any given time, and how networks of genes may work together to produce a biological condition or function. Researchers determine which genes are expressed, and in what magnitude, by measuring levels of selected RNA or proteins that may be present in a biological sample. The desire to map and interpret gene expression patterns has led to demand for technologies that can precisely and efficiently measure the expression level of hundreds of genes simultaneously.
Demand for these new or improved technologies has been driven by researchers in areas such as cancer, immunology, neurology and infectious disease. Researchers in these fields are increasingly attempting to determine which sequences of genes or mutations are important in disease-related biological pathways so new potential treatments might be developed. For example, in the field of cancer, researchers and clinicians have learned that cancer cell behavior is impacted by multiple genes and that analysis of these factors together may be important in determining whether or not a cancer might be responsive to a certain treatment. In addition, more cancers are being detected earlier and tumor samples are becoming smaller and smaller. Tumor samples are often stored in a format known as formalin-fixed paraffin embedded, or FFPE, which complicates subsequent analysis of genetic material. Researchers and clinicians may face similar challenges with analysis of biological samples in other therapeutic areas of interest.
Our nCounter platform, which was commercially launched in 2008, is used to conduct what is known as bulk gene expression analysis, whereby biological samples are first reduced, or broken down, and then gene expression, specifically quantities of selected RNA or proteins, are measured at their average levels throughout the totality of the sample. nCounter can be used to analyze the activity of up to 800 genes in a single experiment.
GeoMx DSP, which was commercially launched in 2019, is a pioneering product platform in the emerging field of spatial biology. While nCounter and other common gene expression analysis technologies use bulk analysis approaches, GeoMx DSP is used to analyze selected regions of an intact biological sample without the need to break down the sample, enabling researchers to see how gene expression might vary across those regions. After a researcher selects regions of interest, GeoMx DSP arranges the biological information extracted from these regions to be subsequently quantified and analyzed, or “read out,” by a platform such as nCounter, whereby researchers can obtain information on up to 96 biological targets per selected region of interest, or by a next generation sequencer, or NGS, system, such as systems manufactured by Illumina, Inc., whereby researchers can obtain information on up to approximately 18,000 biological targets, or the RNA from every gene in the genome, per selected region of interest.
CosMx SMI, which is expected to become commercially available in the second half of 2022, is a new product platform under development in the field of spatial biology. CosMx SMI is being developed to complement our GeoMx DSP. While GeoMx DSP offers researchers the ability to profile gene expression activity in a selected region of interest that may contain multiple cells or cell types, CosMx SMI is designed to enable multiplexed spatial profiling of RNA and protein targets at a single and sub-cellular resolution level. While GeoMx allows for more rapid, higher throughput analysis of gene expression activity in selected regions of interest, CosMx is designed to allow researchers to “drill down” into a specific single cell or sub-
cellular area in a region of interest to gather more information as desired or required. At the time of commercial launch, CosMx SMI is expected to enable the analysis of up to 1,000 RNA targets, or up to 100 protein targets, at a single or sub-cellular level of resolution within morphologically intact tissue samples.
All NanoString product platforms have the versatility to detect both RNA and protein expression and are able to generate reliable and reproduceable data in a variety of biological sample types, including formalin fixed paraffin embedded, or FFPE, sample types.

Industry
Background
Every living organism has a genome that contains a full set of biological instructions required to build and maintain life. A gene is a specific set of instructions embedded in the DNA of a cell. For a gene to be “turned on,” or “expressed,” the cell must first transcribe a copy of its DNA code, or sequence, into molecules of messenger RNA. Then, the cell translates the expressed information contained in RNA into proteins that control most biological processes. In addition to the translated RNAs, there are many types of non-coding RNAs that are involved in many cellular processes and the control of gene expression, including microRNA, or miRNA.
By analyzing the variations in genomes, genes, gene activity or expression and proteins in and between organisms, researchers can determine their functions and roles in health and disease. An improved understanding of the genome and its functions allows researchers to drive advancements in scientific discovery. As they make scientific discoveries, researchers have been able to translate some of these findings into clinical applications that improve patient care.
Biological pathways are the networks of tens or hundreds of genes that work together to produce a biological function. Understanding the activation state of pathways and disruptions in individual elements provides significant insight into the fundamental basis of health and disease and facilitates data driven treatment decisions. As a result, pathway-based biology has become a widely adopted paradigm that researchers use to understand biological processes and has assisted them in the development of diagnostic tests and drugs to treat disease.
Understanding biological pathways has become particularly important in cancer research and treatment. Cancer is a disease generally caused by genetic mutations in cells. The behavior of cancer cells is extremely complex and depends on the activity of many different genes and proteins. It is often impossible for researchers to identify a single gene or protein that adequately predicts a more or less aggressive type of cancer. In some cases, researchers have been able to identify more or less aggressive types of cancer through gene expression analysis of biological pathways, enabling oncologists to determine which specific treatments are most likely to be effective for an individual patient, monitor a patient’s response to those treatments and determine the likelihood of recurrence. Recently cancer researchers, in part based on their research of biological pathways and gene expression, have begun to demonstrate the potential of harnessing a patient’s immune system to fight cancer. A new class of therapeutics, referred to generally as immuno-oncology drugs, have begun to come to market with the promise of long-term remissions, or even cures, in certain types of cancer.
As interest in understanding biological pathways that may be relevant to medicine has increased, academic, government and biopharmaceutical company researchers have aspired to perform analyses of a larger number of genes and samples and are seeking new methods of interrogation that would allow them to:
•increase the number of molecular targets that can be analyzed simultaneously in order to understand the complete biological pathway involving multiple genes;
•analyze the activity of genes within the existing structural integrity, or spatial orientation, of a biological sample;
•provide more reliable, precise and reproducible data about targeted genes and biological pathways;
•maximize the amount of biologic information extracted from precious tissue or other biological samples;
•minimize the computational intensity of complex genomic and proteomic analysis;
•process difficult-to-work-with specimens, such as tumor biopsies stored in FFPE format;
•improve the overall efficiency of their laboratories by simplifying workflow and accelerating the rate of successfully completing their research; and
•create more systematic and reliable ways to help transition their research discoveries into future clinical products.
The interest in new methods of interrogation has led to the development of new research technologies. Certain technologies that have been rapidly adopted by researchers have focused primarily on determining the sequence of a person’s or organism’s DNA, in order to assess how differences among individuals might be predictive of health or disease. In particular, a technology known as next generation sequencing, or NGS, has become widely adopted. In recent years NGS use has accelerated, as the technology has improved and the cost to sequence DNA using NGS has declined. As of December 31, 2021, there were more than 20,000 Illumina NGS systems installed in laboratories globally.
While NGS has revolutionized researchers’ ability to generate gene sequence data rapidly and cost effectively on large numbers of biological samples, other aspects of examining biological pathways are often still done using legacy techniques or new technologies that have proved less capable of providing multiplexed experimentation, ease of use and low cost. Together with determining a gene sequence via NGS, pathway-based research requires further analysis of the activity of multiple genes and small changes in their expression, or of how gene expression may vary depending on where certain cells are situated within biological tissue, which can be challenging for traditional scientific tools.
Researchers interested in multiplex gene expression or biological pathway analysis have traditionally performed experiments using microarrays or quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or qPCR, and protein expression experiments using flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, assays. Many of these techniques have been available for decades, and while suitable for analyzing the expression of a smaller number of genes, may not be cost effective or scalable enough to study biological pathways. While these types of experiments could be repeated to analyze expression of multiple genes, they are often destructive of biological samples, creating limitations given the amounts of biological sample that may be available. These methods also destroy the spatial integrity of the sample, eliminating any potential analysis of differences in how genes may be expressed based on where a cell or cells are situated in tissue, or how they may be interacting with other cells or biological functions. These types of experiments may also involve library preparation and amplification steps that can be cumbersome or time consuming or that may introduce the possibility of measurement errors.
More recently, RNA sequencing, or RNA-Seq, which is done using NGS technology, has enabled researchers to look at the entirety of the gene expression within a single sample. However, NGS systems have a more complex and time-consuming workflow than traditional methods of analyzing gene or protein expression, and RNA-Seq generates large amounts of data that may be expensive to store and may not have relevance to the scientific question being explored.
In both life sciences research and clinical medicine, there is a growing need for improved technologies that can easily, precisely and rapidly measure the activation state of hundreds to thousands of genes simultaneously across a large number of precious samples. Furthermore, there is an emerging desire for technologies that could enable researchers and clinicians to understand gene expression activity in tissue as it is naturally situated in the body, without the need to destroy the structure of the biological sample, in order to see if gene activity might vary depending on how, or where, cells are resident in the sample.
Our Strategy and Solutions
Our strategy is to offer a portfolio of technologies to genomics and proteomics researchers that are easy to use across multiple experimental scales or approaches, and that offer consistent, accurate and reproduceable scientific results in a variety of biological sample types, including those that may be more challenging to use or analyze with alternative technology platforms. Our proprietary chemistries and product platforms offer a number of specific advantages, including:
•Complementary solutions that enable gene expression analysis and spatial biology at multiple scales. Genomics and proteomics science has evolved to where experiments can involve studying gene expression from just a handful of data points from up to thousands of genes at a time, and may involve different types of analysis, such as bulk or spatial analysis or quantifying RNA or proteins. nCounter, our bulk gene expression analysis solution, can profile the activity of up to 800 genes in a single experiment on multiple biological samples per day, with fewer experimental steps as compared to other multiplex gene expression analysis technologies. Our GeoMx DSP spatial biology system enables multiplex profiling, in intact biological samples, of up to approximately 18,000 RNA targets and up to approximately 100 protein targets in selected regions of scientific interest, at multicellular resolution. Our CosMx SMI system is expected to offer the ability to analyze up to 1,000 RNA targets and up to 100 protein targets in specifically selected regions of a biological sample at single cell or sub-cellular resolution. We believe the breadth of gene expression 
research applications offered by our product platforms may provide our customers with a complete solution for their laboratories, as well as consistency of platform features, usability and performance.
•Ease of use and automation. Gene expression research requires the extraction and analysis of large amounts of data, often from studies comprising hundreds of biological samples, which can make manual or non-automated experimental approaches cumbersome, labor intensive or expensive. Our product platforms are designed to offer minimal sample preparation and automated workflow, which enables the simultaneous analysis of up to thousands of genes and hundreds of proteins in approximately 24 hours between the time a sample is loaded and results are obtained. Our nCounter system can analyze from between 24 to 96 samples per day, depending upon the system choice and configuration. GeoMx DSP allows for throughput of 10 or more biological samples per day, depending on the number of regions in the sample selected for analysis. The ability to analyze several samples in a single day facilitates the more rapid completion of scientific studies for publication, or the use of our systems for analysis of pharmaceutical clinical trial results with large numbers of patients enrolled.
•Flexible and Efficient Biological Sample Requirements. Some biological samples, such as FFPE samples, can be challenging for scientists to work with, as the storage medium can make it difficult to extract gene expression information, or may partially degrade RNA or protein present in a sample. Biological samples may also be shared across multiple researchers, offering advantages to platforms that are able to work with smaller sample amounts. Our systems are designed to unlock biologic information from minute amounts of a variety of challenging tissue samples, including FFPE samples, cell lysates and single cells, which may be important in settings where samples are used across multiple researchers and experiments, such as pharmaceutical product development.
•Robust and reproduceable scientific results. Some chemistries used in gene expression analysis have error rates that may lead to inconsistent data across the same or similar biological samples. Our chemistries hybridize directly to target molecules in a biological sample, which allows target molecules to be counted with high accuracy. Our approaches generate digital information (1 molecule = 1 count) which provides consistent and accurate data with excellent reproducibility, even in biological samples that can be challenging to work with, offering confidence for scientists preparing scientific studies for publication or utilizing results to understand the outcomes of pharmaceutical clinical trials.
Our Products and Technology
Our products operate in the bulk gene expression and spatial biology markets, which exist within the larger life sciences technologies market. nCounter, our first commercially available product, was launched in 2008 and operates within the bulk gene expression market and primarily serves the clinical, or translational, research market, often in connection with pharmaceutical product development and human clinical trials of potential new therapies. Our portfolio of spatial biology solutions, which include our commercially available GeoMx DSP platform and our CosMx SMI product platform under development, are uniquely suited to address researcher needs across both the discovery and translational research markets. Our nCounter systems including the nCounter FLEX system, which was cleared by the U.S Food and Drug Administration, FDA, as an in vitro diagnostic medical device and can be used for research or clinical diagnostic applications. GeoMx DSP and CosMx SMI are intended for research use only, but we may eventually develop these instruments for use in the clinical diagnostics market.
nCounter Analysis System
Our nCounter Analysis System is an automated, multi-application, digital detection and counting system which directly profiles hundreds of molecules simultaneously, using our proprietary optical barcoding chemistry that is powerful enough for use in research, yet simple enough for use in clinical laboratories. Our nCounter Analysis System is based on automated instruments that prepare and analyze biological samples using proprietary reagents which can only be obtained from us. Our research and clinical laboratory customers purchase instruments from us and then purchase our reagents and related consumables for the specific experiment they wish to conduct and for tests that they intend to run, respectively.
Our nCounter Analysis System is capable of supporting a number of applications including gene expression, protein expression, gene mutation, miRNA expression, copy number variation, gene fusions and molecular diagnostics. We believe our nCounter Analysis System offers a number of advantages, including providing a simpler and faster workflow with minimal hands-on time for multiplex analysis of up to 800 RNA, or protein targets. Additionally, because nCounter is fully automated and easy-to-use, it is ideal for a range of applications requiring efficient, high-precision, simultaneous quantitation of hundreds of target molecules across a set of biological samples. Our nCounter assays generate high-quality results from challenging sample types, including FFPE and crude cell lysates.
nCounter Instrument Platforms
—————
The left image is the nCounter SPRINT system, the middle image is the nCounter MAX system and the right image is the nCounter FLEX system.
We currently offer three versions of our nCounter Analysis System, each targeted at a distinct user segment. Our nCounter SPRINT is designed to appeal to individual researchers running relatively smaller experiments. Our nCounter MAX is a higher throughput instrument with features appealing to larger core laboratories serving multiple researchers. Our nCounter FLEX, which is targeted toward clinical laboratories, is a version of our MAX system that has been 510(k) cleared by the FDA and CE marked by European regulatory authorities. The nCounter FLEX system was designed and is manufactured under ISO 13485:2003, the current quality standard for in vitro diagnostic platforms and medical devices. nCounter FLEX is enabled to run the Prosigna® breast cancer assay, as well as other proprietary or laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, that may be developed. Pursuant to the terms of our License and Asset Purchase Agreement, or LAPA, with Veracyte, Inc., or Veracyte, we granted to Veracyte an exclusive worldwide license to our nCounter FLEX system for in vitro diagnostic use and for the development and commercialization of in vitro diagnostic tests on the nCounter FLEX system and sold to Veracyte certain assets, including our rights with respect to the Prosigna breast cancer assay. For additional information regarding our agreement with Veracyte, see “ — License Agreements — Veracyte, Inc.” below.
The nCounter MAX and FLEX systems comprise a Prep Station and a Digital Analyzer. The Prep Station is the automated liquid handling component that processes and prepares the samples for data collection on the Digital Analyzer. The Digital Analyzer collects data from samples by taking images of the immobilized fluorescent reporters in the sample cartridge and processing the data into output files, which include the target identifier and related count numbers along with a broad set of internal controls that validate the precision of each assay. The nCounter MAX and FLEX throughput listed in the table below can be quadrupled using sample multiplexing for experiments targeting 200 genes or fewer. The nCounter SPRINT Profiler combines the liquid handling steps and the digital analysis through use of a special microfluidic cartridge.

Custom CodeSets
We work with our customers to design and develop custom gene expression CodeSets to enable them to evaluate specific genes that are the subject of their study. Our customers provide us a list of targets for which we subsequently build a unique CodeSet to their specifications. Our design process leverages full length sequences for the RNA molecules that our customers are interested in detecting and prevents cross hybridization to non-target molecules in the sample. The custom CodeSet design process occurs in four distinct steps: (1) the customer selects the genes of interest, (2) we design probes and provide a design report to the customer, (3) the customer reviews and approves the design report and (4) we manufacture, test and ship the CodeSet to the customer. The manufacturing process typically takes from three to five weeks, depending on the number of genes targeted and samples to be processed by the customer.
nCounter Software and Data Analysis
nCounter instrument platforms also include our nSolver Analysis Software, a data analysis program that offers researchers the ability to quickly and easily quality check, normalize and analyze their data without having to use any additional software for data analysis. The FLEX system, in addition to running any of our research applications, can also be enabled with software that runs Prosigna to generate individualized patient reports.
In May 2020, we announced a collaboration with ROSALIND™ Bioinformatics, a provider of cloud-based genomic analysis tools, for the development of new analysis tools for data generated on our nCounter Analysis System. ROSALIND offers a cloud-based platform that connects researchers to differential expression and pathway exploration in a real-time collaborative environment.
Functionality has been built into ROSALIND’s cloud-based analysis suite that facilitates nCounter data visualization, exploration and collaboration. These new capabilities were offered immediately through early access to COVID-19 researchers performing critical host response studies on our nCounter platform. In 2021, ROSALIND created a unique data analysis solution specific to the nCounter TCR Diversity Panel, which is routinely utilized to profile T-cell receptor variable and constant regions and other T-cell markers, resulting in a TCR Diversity Score. We are working with ROSALIND to make certain features of nSolver available within ROSALIND, and we are evaluating opportunities for joint development of new analysis solutions.
Molecular Diagnostics
Our nCounter Analysis System has the precision, reproducibility and simple workflow required of technologies used in clinical laboratories. We believe the precision, ease of use and flexibility of the nCounter Analysis System may allow medical technicians to conduct complex molecular diagnostic tests with minimal training. 
Clinical laboratory customers use the nCounter Analysis System and our Prosigna breast cancer assay to provide clinical diagnostic services. Prosigna is based on a collection of 50 genes known as the PAM50 gene signature, which was discovered by several of our research customers. Prosigna can provide a breast cancer patient and physician with a subtype classification based on the fundamental biology of the patient’s tumor, as well as a prognostic score that indicates the probability of cancer recurrence over 10 years. Physicians use Prosigna to help guide therapeutic decisions so that patients receive a therapeutic intervention, such as chemotherapy, only if clinically warranted. In September 2013, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market in the United States a version of Prosigna providing a prognostic indicator for distant recurrence-free survival at 10 years. In December 2019, we entered into an exclusive license of nCounter diagnostic assets and rights to Veracyte, Inc. (“Veracyte”). For additional information regarding our agreement with Veracyte, see “ — License Agreements — Veracyte, Inc.” below.
GeoMx DSP
Our GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, or GeoMx DSP, which was made commercially available in 2019, is a pioneering product platform in the emerging field of spatial biology. nCounter and many other existing gene expression analysis technologies typically assess the average gene expression throughout the totality of a biological sample using sample reduction, or “grind and bind” approaches. GeoMx DSP is designed to allow researchers to explore and quantify how the expression of large numbers of genes vary in different selected regions of interest across the landscape of a heterogeneous biological sample, retaining spatial information and providing assays that target different regions in the same sample.
 
—————
The left image is the GeoMx DSP instrument, the middle image is a sample of regions of interest, or ROIs, in a biological sample that have been selected by a researcher using GeoMx DSP for further analysis, and the right image is a “volcano plot” comparing the differential gene expression across regions within the biological sample.
The primary technologies historically used by researchers and clinicians to analyze gene activity in selected parts of a biological sample include immunohistochemistry, or IHC, which is used to estimate amounts of protein, and in-situ hybridization, or ISH, which is used to estimate amounts of RNA. Both IHC and ISH use fluorescent stains that provide the ability to identify typically four proteins or RNA at a time based on assigned colors. The colors aid researchers in identifying where certain proteins or RNA may reside in a sample and provide a visual approximation of amounts. These techniques are generally limited however in their ability to only look at four proteins or RNA at a time and offer no ability to precisely quantify the amounts present in any given region or cell type. These limitations may lead to incomplete scientific conclusions as to the most relevant biological pathways in any given sample.
GeoMx DSP is designed to allow researchers to quantify a much larger number of RNA or proteins spatially within multiple regions of interest across the landscape of a heterogeneous section of a biological sample. Our GeoMx DSP instrument images slide-mounted or freshly cut sample sections, allowing users to select regions of interest for subsequent quantification and analysis, or molecular profiling. The post-selection profiling or “read out,” can be performed using either our nCounter Analysis System, or an Illumina NGS system. 
We believe GeoMx DSP offers a number of advantages as compared to traditional spatial technologies, including the ability to profile both RNA and protein, the ability to multiplex large numbers of different RNA or proteins simultaneously in each selected region, flexibility on the selection of regions to analyze, and the ability to process 10 or more biological samples per day.
When GeoMx DSP was first made commercially available, researchers were only able to read out information on up to 96 biological targets from each of their GeoMx-selected regions of interest using nCounter. In August 2020, we added software capabilities and consumables which enabled GeoMx region of interest data to be read out using Illumina NGS systems, which significantly expanded the number of biological targets researchers can choose to analyze in selected regions. Linking GeoMx DSP with NGS also significantly expands our total potential market opportunity. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 20,000 Illumina NGS systems installed globally.
In the first half of 2021, our Whole Transcriptome Atlas, or WTA, became commercially available and further expanded the number of biological targets that may be read out on NGS systems to approximately 18,000 RNAs. WTA provides an unbiased, spatial view of all protein coding genes in a selected region of interest and is designed for use on GeoMx DSP using NGS readout.
GeoMx DSP Instrument and Software
Our GeoMx DSP instrument uses specialized optics to image slide-mounted biopsies that have been prepared using our GeoMx DSP consumable reagents, as well as with IHC or ISH technology typically available in research or commercial laboratories. GeoMx DSP then allows a researcher to select regions of interest for analysis on screen, and then prepares samples from the selected regions of interest for molecular profiling. Like nCounter, GeoMx DSP is capable of supporting applications including gene expression and protein expression. GeoMx DSP is fully automated and easy to use, requiring only 30 minutes of hands-on time per run and offering the ability to process up to 10 slides per day and is therefore ideal for a range of applications requiring efficient, high-precision, simultaneous quantitation of large numbers of target molecules across a set of biological samples.
The GeoMx DSP software enables the integration of the four color images acquired and the corresponding digital counts of the levels of RNA or protein as acquired using our nCounter Analysis System, or an Illumina NGS system. The GeoMx DSP data center uniquely combines system control to visualize whole sample images at single cell resolution with automated or manual region of interest selection. The fully integrated workflow provides tracking of image data and corresponding profiling data, allowing users to easily go from data collection to data analysis. In addition to our internally developed software, in 2020 we announced a collaboration with Illumina, whereby we are jointly developing a GeoMx DSP application powered by Illumina’s DRAGEN Bio-IT platform in order to facilitate the analysis of data generated by our customers using NGS read out on Illumina systems.
GeoMx DSP Consumables
Our current portfolio of GeoMx DSP consumables focuses on RNA and protein profiling for immunology, immuno-oncology and neurobiology applications, targeted either for nCounter read out where a set of genes and a biological pathway may be better understood for more targeted experiments, or for NGS read-out in basic discovery applications where significantly greater numbers of genes may be of interest. GeoMx DSP consumable products are currently designed as standardized panel products that represent important content for certain disease areas with an option for researchers to add customized content to that panel depending on the area of interest or desired number of targets for analysis. Our GeoMx DSP assays generate high-quality results from challenging sample types, including FFPE and crude cell lysates.
Our significant GeoMx DSP consumable products include:

An immuno-oncology-focused panel menu that comprises up to 96 protein and RNA targets for analyzing the tumor and tumor microenvironment compartments in human and mouse biological samples. The standard, or core, panel offering is comprised of 18 targets, and researchers have the option of adding over 30 additional targets for analysis focused on specific applications such as immuno-oncology drug target proteins, or human immune activation proteins, and 23 additional targets for analyzing mouse samples for pre-clinical applications. In addition, we offer RNA panel content to allow for the analysis of up to 84 targets for human immune pathways.
•Neurobiology Panels. A neurobiology-focused menu that comprises up to 40 protein targets to profile human neural cells. The standard, or core, panel offering comprises 20 targets, and researchers have the option of adding up to 20 additional targets for analysis focused on specific applications such as proteins implicated in Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease.
Enabled for NGS readout
Targeted:
•Cancer Transcriptome Atlas (CTA). An oncology and immuno-oncology focused panel was the first commercial GeoMx DSP product to enable read out using NGS. The CTA allows for a nearly 20-fold increase in RNA targets that may be profiled as compared to GeoMx DSP RNA panels designed for nCounter read out, providing a high-resolution spatial view of cancer biology. The CTA includes more than 1,800 genes that cover over 100 pathways critical to understanding tumor biology, the immune response and the tumor microenvironment. Biological content can be further customized with the addition of up to 60 user defined targets. The CTA panel is compatible with both fresh frozen and FFPE-embedded biological samples, allowing scientists to work with a broad spectrum of samples in their research. As part of a full end-to-end solution, we are providing library preparation reagents and NGS readout, a bioinformatics pipeline that links high-resolution, full-slide images generated on GeoMx DSP with the massively parallel output of Illumina sequencers.
Universal:
•Protein Assays. A commercially available panel for NGS readout that includes greater than 140 protein targets. The currently available content covers applications in immuno-oncology and future content releases are planned to cover immunology and neuroscience. These assays will provide GeoMx CTA and WTA users complementary protein content designed for NGS read out. These new protein assays have been tested for performance on both fresh frozen and FFPE-embedded biological samples. Our GeoMx DSP Protein Assays for NGS readout expanded the protein capabilities of GeoMx DSP from tens to now hundreds of validated proteins to be analyzed from a single sample section with spatial resolution. 
•Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA). The WTA, a GeoMx DSP consumable product that became commercially available for use in human and mouse biological samples during 2021, is a universal panel that provides an unbiased, spatial view of approximately 18,000 RNA targets and is designed to be read out using NGS. The WTA unlocks new pathways to be explored by researchers and is designed to broaden GeoMx RNA profiling from oncology and immunology to include neuroscience, developmental biology and other diverse fields. The WTA assay provides robust and sensitive performance both fresh frozen and FFPE-embedded biological samples, allowing scientists to work with a broad spectrum of samples in their research. WTA utilizes the same workflow and chemistry as our CTA. 
GeoMx DSP Technology Access Program (TAP)
Selected customers can access our GeoMx DSP through our in-house TAP service and may select panels that read out on either nCounter or NGS. Through GeoMx DSP TAP, customers submit biological samples to our Seattle facilities where they are imaged and profiled using our instruments and once completed, we provide a detailed report, which includes raw data and analyzed results back to the customer. We have successfully utilized GeoMx DSP TAP prior to and during our GeoMx DSP instrument and product commercial launches and believe it may be a leading indicator of potential future commercial demand for our products. To date, we have conducted over 770 TAP projects.
CosMx SMI
    Our CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager, or CosMx SMI, is a new spatial biology product platform currently under development. CosMx SMI is designed to combine the spatial profiling of a large number of biological targets with high-resolution imaging, which will allow researchers to both analytically measure as well as visualize the activity of selected RNA or proteins at the single cell or sub-cellular level. CosMx SMI is expected to enable the analysis of up to 1,000 RNA targets or up to 100 protein targets directly from single cells within morphologically intact biological samples. CosMx SMI will offer researchers the opportunity to “drill down” further into regions of interest in biological samples, as a complement to our GeoMx DSP which typically offers gene expression profiling across regions containing multiple cells. 
During 2021, we began offering a TAP service for our CosMx SMI product candidate, and we currently expect the instrument, consumables, and software associated with our CosMx SMI platform to be made commercially available in the second half of 2022.
CosMx SMI incorporates a proprietary version of our chemistry that was originally developed as part of our concluded collaboration with Lam Research, under which Lam provided us with $50.0 million in funding and we modified our core nCounter chemistry to be utilized in a NGS sequencing platform and related assays. Upon the conclusion of our Lam collaboration, in 2020 we began exploring applications for this newly developed chemistry in spatial biology, specifically whether we could conduct spatial analysis of increasingly smaller regions of interest, down to the individual cell and potentially sub-cellular level. Upon completing proof of principle research and development, we announced the expected development and commercialization timeline for CosMx SMI in December 2020.

The left image is the CosMx SMI instrument, the middle image is a single-cell expression map of selected genes and the right image is a spatially-resolved cell type map in a biological sample.
Biology takes place on several spatial scales including multi-cellular, single cell and sub-cellular levels. Our GeoMx DSP enables multi-cellular analysis at the whole transcriptome level to elucidate the behavior of populations of cells, such as those within a tumor or the tumor microenvironment. We are developing CosMx SMI to address the unmet need for high-plex spatial analysis at single cell and sub-cellular resolution, which may be ideally suited for targeted applications such as creating cell atlases or studying cell-cell interactions. Our GeoMx DSP and CosMx SMI platforms are expected to be synergistic, creating a spatial biology portfolio that spans the continuum from targeted to whole transcriptome analysis, and from multicellular resolution down to single cell and sub cellular applications. 
To date, our prototype CosMx SMI systems have imaged RNA from up to 1,000 genes simultaneously across thousands of individual cells in FFPE-embedded biological samples. We believe in order to answer fundamental questions for the discovery, translational, clinical researchers in single cell biology, the ability to analyze the activity of at least 1,000 genes is the minimum panel requirement.
License Agreements
We have relied, and expect to continue to rely, on strategic collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. For example, our molecular barcoding chemistry technology is in-licensed from the Institute for Systems Biology. In addition, we have licensed technology related to our diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, assay from the National Institutes of Health, and we rely on other license and supply arrangements for proprietary components which require us to pay royalties on the sale of our products. Other research customers are using our nCounter Analysis System and GeoMx DSP to discover gene expression signatures that we believe could form the basis of future diagnostic products. In the future, we may consider these gene signatures for in-licensing. 
Veracyte, Inc. 
In December 2019, we entered into a LAPA and Service and Supply Agreements, or SSAs, with Veracyte. Pursuant to the LAPA, we completed a license of intellectual property and a sale of certain assets to Veracyte relating to our nCounter FLEX system for use in clinical diagnostic applications. Veracyte also acquired certain intellectual property rights and worldwide distribution rights relating to Prosigna and our LymphMark assay, and certain clinical diagnostic assay software modules that operate with the nCounter FLEX system. Pursuant to the LAPA, we provided Veracyte a worldwide exclusive license to market and sell clinical diagnostic tests developed for our nCounter FLEX platform for in vitro diagnostic use and for the development and commercialization of in vitro diagnostic tests, including in vitro diagnostic devices or laboratory developed tests, for use on the nCounter FLEX platform. In connection with the transaction, Veracyte agreed to assume certain liabilities associated with the assets purchased under the LAPA, including ongoing third-party royalty obligations relating to Prosigna and LymphMark. We also assigned to Veracyte our Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with Bioclassifier, LLC, effective July 7, 2010, as amended, which granted rights to certain intellectual property related to Prosigna. We also entered into a sublicense agreement with Veracyte relating to the Bioclassifier Agreement wherein we obtained certain non-exclusive rights relating to our rights to provide Prosigna to Veracyte on an ongoing basis and for other research or investigational purposes. 
Upon consummation of the LAPA, Veracyte paid us total consideration of $50.0 million, consisting of (i) $40.0 million in cash and (ii) 376,732 shares of Veracyte common stock valued at $10.0 million. Pursuant to the LAPA, we are eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to $10.0 million in the aggregate, to be paid upon the launch of additional clinical diagnostic tests by Veracyte for our nCounter FLEX platform. 
Pursuant to the SSAs, we agreed to supply to Veracyte nCounter FLEX systems, and to manufacture and supply Prosigna kits, LymphMark kits and any additional clinical diagnostic tests that Veracyte may develop in the future for nCounter, for a period of at least four years subsequent to the transaction date. Pursuant to the SSAs, Veracyte will pay the designated transfer prices for nCounter FLEX systems, Prosigna kits, LymphMark kits and any other nCounter-based diagnostic tests developed by Veracyte.
Institute for Systems Biology
In 2004, we entered into an agreement with the Institute for Systems Biology pursuant to which the Institute granted to us an exclusive, subject to certain government rights, worldwide license, including the right to sublicense, to the digital molecular barcoding technology on which our nCounter Analysis System is based, including 13 patents and patent applications. Pursuant to the terms of the amended license agreement, we are required to pay the Institute for Systems Biology royalties on net sales of products sold by us, or our sublicensees, at a low single digit percentage rate, which was reduced by 50% in the third quarter of 2016 for the remainder of the license term due to the achievement of a cumulative sales threshold. Through December 31, 2021, we have paid aggregate royalties of $7.9 million under the license agreement. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the amended license agreement, the agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to 
expire patent licensed to us. The Institute for Systems Biology has the right to terminate the agreement under certain situations, including our failure to meet certain diligence requirements or our uncured material breach of the agreement.
Collaborations
Lam Research Corporation
In August 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Lam Research Corporation, or Lam, to develop a NGS sequencing platform and related assays. Under the terms of the agreement, Lam contributed an aggregate of $50.0 million towards the project. As of December 31, 2019, all committed development funding had been received from Lam, and as of December 31, 2020 all we received had been used in our continued development activities associated with our NGS sequencing platform and related assays. 
In connection with the execution of the collaboration agreement, we issued Lam a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price for the warrant of $16.75 per share, with the number of underlying shares exercisable at any time proportionate to the amount of the $50.0 million commitment that had been provided by Lam. In January 2020, we issued an aggregate of 407,247 shares of our common stock to Lam upon the exercise of the warrant in full by Lam. In exchange for our waiver of certain lock-up restrictions, Lam agreed (i) to coordinate any sales of the shares with certain brokerage firms approved by us and (ii) not to sell more than 10% of the average daily trading volume of our common stock for the 30-day period immediately preceding any sale of the shares by Lam.
All intellectual property made or conceived solely by us pursuant to the collaboration will be owned by us and licensed to Lam solely for the purposes of the collaboration. All intellectual property made or conceived solely by Lam pursuant to the collaboration will be owned by Lam and, subject to certain restrictions on use with Lam competitors, licensed to us for the purposes of the collaboration and further development and commercialization of our products and technologies resulting from the collaboration in the field of molecular profiling. Jointly created intellectual property will be jointly owned, provided that neither we nor Lam use such jointly owned intellectual property in the other party’s competitive field. Lam is eligible to receive certain single-digit percentage royalty payments from us on net sales of certain products and technologies developed under the agreement, if any such net sales are recorded. The maximum amount of royalties we may pay to Lam will be capped at $150.0 million (three times the amount of development funding actually provided by Lam). We retain exclusive rights to obtain regulatory approval, manufacture and commercialize any products.
Celgene Corporation
In March 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Celgene to develop, seek regulatory approval for, and commercialize a companion diagnostic using the nCounter Analysis System to identify a subset of patients with DLBCL. In February 2018, we entered into an amendment with Celgene to our collaboration agreement in which Celgene agreed to provide us with additional funding for work intended to enable a subtype and prognostic indication for the test being developed under the agreement for Celgene’s drug REVLIMID. In connection with this amendment, we agreed to remove the right to receive payments from Celgene in the event commercial sales of the companion diagnostic test do not exceed certain pre-specified minimum annual revenues during the first three years following regulatory approval. In addition, the amendment allows Celgene, at its election, to use trial samples with additional technologies for companion diagnostics.
Pursuant to our agreement with Celgene, we have been developing an in vitro diagnostic test, LymphMark, as a potential companion diagnostic to aid in identifying patients with DLBCL for treatment. In April 2019, Celgene announced that the trial evaluating REVLIMID for the treatment of DLBCL did not meet its primary endpoint. In May 2019, our collaboration agreement with Celgene was terminated effective July 2019, resulting in the recognition of substantially all of the remaining deferred revenue from the agreement. As a result, we do not intend to file a pre-market approval for LymphMark as a companion diagnostic for REVLIMID. 
Intellectual Property
We must develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our technologies in order to remain competitive. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality, material transfer agreements, licenses, invention assignment agreements and other contracts to protect our intellectual property rights.
As of December 31, 2021, we owned or exclusively licensed approximately 35 issued U.S. patents and approximately 24 pending U.S. patent applications, including provisional and non-provisional filings and 5 pre-nationalization PCT applications. We also owned or licensed approximately 303 pending and granted counterpart applications worldwide, including 126 country-specific validations of 18 European patents. The issued U.S. patents that we own or exclusively license are expected to expire between September 3, 2024 and November 21, 2037. We have either sole or joint ownership positions in all of our pending U.S. patent applications. Where we jointly own cases, we typically have negotiated license or assignment 
provisions to obtain exclusive rights. For our material nCounter Analysis System we are the exclusive licensee. We also generally protect our newly developed intellectual property by entering into confidentiality agreements that include intellectual property assignment clauses with our employees, consultants and collaborators. Our patent applications generally relate to the following main areas: 
•our nCounter Analysis System or GeoMx DSP biology, chemistry, methods and hardware;
•specific applications for our nCounter Analysis System or GeoMx DSP technology;
•our gene expression markers, methods and gene signatures for recurrence and drug response in certain forms of cancer;
•methods and systems for the processing and analysis of spatial profiling and sequencing data;
•biological and chemical compositions, methods and hardware for enzyme and amplification free sequencing; and
•biological and chemical compositions, methods and hardware for multiplexed detection and quantification of protein and/or nucleic acid expression in a defined region of a tissue or cell.
We intend to file additional patent applications in the United States and abroad to strengthen our intellectual property rights; however, our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure investors that any patents that have issued or might issue will protect our technology. We have received notices of claims of potential infringement from third parties and may receive additional notices in the future. When appropriate, we have taken a license to the intellectual property rights from such third parties. For additional information, see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
We own a number of trademarks and develop names for our new products and as appropriate secure trademark protection for them, including domain name registration, in relevant jurisdictions.
Research and Development
We have committed, and expect to continue to commit, significant resources to developing new technologies and products, improving product performance and reliability and reducing costs. We are continuously seeking to improve our product platforms, including the technology, software, accessibility and overall capability. We also seek to develop additional research consumable content, new product platforms and new product capabilities. We have assembled experienced research and development teams at our greater Seattle, Washington area facilities with the scientific, engineering, software and process talent that we believe is required to successfully grow our business. As of December 31, 2021, we had 210 employees in research and development. 
Sales and Marketing
We began selling nCounter to researchers in 2008 and GeoMx DSP in 2019. We sell our instruments and related products primarily through our own sales force in North America and through a combination of direct and distributor channels in Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and South America. We have agreements with 38 distributors, each of which is specific to a certain territory. In the event a distributor does not meet minimum performance requirements, we may terminate the distribution agreement or convert from an exclusive to non-exclusive arrangement within the territory, allowing us to enter into arrangements with other distributors for the territory. 
For additional information regarding geographic distribution of revenue, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report. 
Our sales and marketing efforts are targeted at department heads, research or clinical laboratory directors, principal investigators, core facility directors and research scientists and pathologists at leading academic institutions, biopharmaceutical companies, publicly and privately-funded research institutions and contract research organizations. We seek to increase awareness of our products among our target customers through direct sales calls, trade shows, seminars, academic conferences, web presence and other forms of internet marketing.
Our instruments require a significant capital investment, and our sales process involves numerous interactions with multiple individuals within an organization, and often includes in-depth analysis by potential customers of our products, performance of proof-of-principle studies, preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. As a result of these factors, the significant capital investment required in purchasing our instruments and the budget cycles of our customers, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order can vary significantly and be up to 12 months or longer. Given the length and uncertainty of our sales cycle, we have in the past experienced, and likely will in the future experience, fluctuations in our instrument sales on a period-to-period basis.
We have continued to invest in our commercial channel to increase our reach and productivity. For example, in 2019, we added certain roles to focus specifically on the launch efforts associated with our GeoMx DSP system. We believe these investments help to drive the growth of our installed instrument base, and the continued utilization of our consumables by our installed base of instrument users.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We use third-party contract manufacturers to produce our instruments and certain raw materials for our consumables. We build our consumables at our facilities in the greater Seattle, Washington area.
Instruments
We outsource manufacturing of our instruments. Precision System Science, Co., Ltd. of Chiba, Japan, or PSS, is our sole source supplier for the nCounter Prep Station. Korvis Automation Inc., or Korvis, is our sole source supplier for our nCounter Digital Analyzers and our GeoMx DSP instrument at its facility in Corvallis, Oregon. Paramit Corporation, or Paramit, is our sole source supplier for our nCounter SPRINT Profiler at its facility in Morgan Hill, California. D&K Engineering, Inc. of San Diego, California is our sole source supplier of our CosMx SMI instrument.
The facilities at which our instruments are built have been certified to ISO 13485:2003 standards. Our contracts with these instrument suppliers do not commit them to carry inventory or make available any particular quantities. Under the terms of our instrument supply agreements, we are required to place binding purchase orders for instruments that will be delivered to us by the supplier from the date of placement of the purchase order. Although qualifying alternative third-party manufacturers could be time consuming and expensive, our instruments’ design is similar to that of other instruments and we believe that alternatives would be available if necessary. However, if our instrument suppliers terminate our relationship with them or if they give other customers’ needs higher priority than ours, then we may not be able to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms.
Consumables
We manufacture our consumables in our greater Seattle, Washington area facilities, certain of which have been certified to ISO 13485:2003 standards. In the past several years, we have expanded our manufacturing capacity through additional leased space as well as by relocating certain research and development functions and converting the space to incremental manufacturing labs and offices. In the future, should additional space become necessary, we believe that there will be space available near our existing facilities, however we cannot predict that this space will be available if and when it is needed.
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components and materials used in the manufacture of our consumables. Some of these components are sourced from a single supplier. For example, Cidra Precision Services, LLC, of Wallingford, Connecticut, part of IDEX Health & Science, is the sole supplier of the microfluidic cartridge for our nCounter SPRINT Profiler. For some components, we have qualified second sources for several of our critical reagents, including oligonucleotides, adhesives and dyes. We believe that having dual sources for our components helps reduce the risk of a production delay caused by a disruption in the supply of a critical component. We continue to pursue qualifying additional suppliers, but cannot predict how expensive, time-consuming or successful these efforts will be. If we were to lose one or more of our suppliers, it may take significant time and effort to qualify alternative suppliers.
Competition
In the life sciences research market, we compete with companies such as Agilent Technologies, Bio-Rad, Bio-Techne, Fluidigm, Illumina, Qiagen, Thermo Fisher Scientific and 10x Genomics. These competitors and others have products for gene and protein expression analysis and spatial biology that compete in certain segments of the market in which we sell our products. In addition, there are a number of new market entrants in the process of developing novel technologies for the life sciences market, including those that may compete with GeoMx DSP or our CosMx SMI.
We believe that we have multiple competitive advantages, including the automated nature of our systems with simple, rapid and efficient workflow that requires very limited human intervention or labor; the multiplexing capability of our technology to analyze significantly more target molecules in a single experiment; the ability to analyze combinations of RNA and proteins; compatibility with many sample types, including difficult samples such as FFPE; and the ability to analyze small sample inputs, in some cases down to a single cell, from a wide variety of sample types.
While we believe that we compete favorably based on the factors described above, many of our competitors enjoy other competitive advantages over us, including:
•greater name and brand recognition, financial and human resources;
•broader product lines;
•larger sales forces and more established distributor networks;
•substantial intellectual property portfolios;
•larger and more established customer bases and relationships; and
•better established, larger scale and lower cost manufacturing capabilities.
For additional information, see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors - The life sciences research market is highly competitive. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and operating results will suffer.”
Human Capital
Our employees are guided by our mission to map the universe of biology. Our core values of grit, authenticity, ambition, ingenuity and commitment to customers serve to guide us on our path toward achieving our mission. Our core values set the foundation for our attitudes and actions, how we conduct our business, interact with each other and our customers and evaluate employee performance. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 766 employees, of which 222 work in manufacturing, 252 in sales, marketing and business development, 210 in research and development and 82 in general and administrative. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2021, of our 766 employees, 675 were employed in the United States and 91 were employed outside the United States.
Talent Acquisition and Development and Employee Engagement
Our employees play a key role in our ability to serve our customers and achieve our mission and we strive to attract, empower and retain high quality talent that is inspired, diverse and driven. To attract and retain top talent, we strive to create opportunities for our employees to grow and develop their careers and ensure they are supported by competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits program. 
We believe employee career development is an investment in our employees’ skills and our future. We offer career development opportunities such as educational reimbursement, onsite training to enhance job-related skills, management development programs and opportunities to attend job related conferences and seminars. Additionally, we have an annual formal employee review program which standardizes performance evaluation across all areas in the organization and aids in supporting our employees’ career and personal development, which ultimately contributes to achieving our mission. 
We believe it is important to encourage open and direct communication at all levels in our organization and we regularly use employee experience and feedback surveys to understand whether our human capital policies are effective and where we can improve.
Compensation and Benefits
We believe we provide competitive and comprehensive financial compensation and benefits for our employees and our programs are designed to meet our employees’ needs. In addition to salaries, these programs (which may vary by country or region) include new employee equity grants, additional discretionary equity awards, including a discretionary annual equity grant, discretionary merit-based annual bonuses, a voluntary employee stock purchase program, a 401(k) plan which includes partial employer matching contributions, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, flexible paid time off, family leave, employee assistance programs, an educational reimbursement program and health and wellness programs. In addition, we believe our employees can make a meaningful difference in their local communities and we offer all employees paid time off to volunteer in community involvement activities of their choice.
COVID-19 Pandemic Safety
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented several changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, customers, the communities we operate in and which comply with government and health and safety regulations. We have created an internal committee of senior management leaders, including our director of employee health and safety, that meets a minimum of once a week and is focused on creating and maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all employees, our customers and the communities in which we operate during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe racism and discrimination are unacceptable. We are committed to building and maintaining a diverse and inclusive business and have diversity, equity and inclusion programs in place to help us achieve our commitment. 
We seek diversity, equity and inclusion at every level in our organization. Our board of directors includes directors from various backgrounds, industries, skills and experience. We recently added two new members with diverse backgrounds to our board of directors in 2021. Our board of ten directors now includes three women and is racially diverse. Our senior leadership team includes leaders with diverse skills, experience, racial background and genders. Our employees come from numerous countries and various backgrounds and we strive to provide a diverse and inclusive environment.
We have active programs in place and continue to focus on extending our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. As part of our program, we seek to make diversity, equity and inclusion a focus for our recruiting and hiring practices, including by ensuring we have diverse representations in our recruiting pool and interview panel. To further our commitment to create an inclusive and diverse culture, we engaged a third-party diversity, equity and inclusion consultant to assist us in our commitment.
We currently have three employee resource groups, or ERGs, that focus on communities including women, people of color and LGBTQ+. We believe these ERGs are guided by our priorities and values and provide a way for employees with common interests to connect, obtain professional development and participate in community outreach opportunities. We may expand our ERG offerings in the future.
In 2020, we joined Washington Employers for Racial Equity, or WERE, which is a new statewide coalition dedicated to racial equity and opportunity for all. As a coalition member, we have signed a Commitment to Progress, committing to own our part of the problem and setting specific improvement goals. As members of the coalition, we will listen, learn, partner, invest and work toward solutions in our own company and our communities. 
Government Regulation
Medical Device Regulation
United States
In the United States, medical devices, including in vitro diagnostics, are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, medical device development, testing, labeling, storage, premarket clearance or approval, advertising and promotion and product sales and distribution.
A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component part or accessory, which is (1) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or (2) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. In vitro diagnostics are a type of medical device, and are tests that can be used in the screening or diagnosis and/or detection of diseases, conditions or infections, including, without limitation, the presence of certain chemicals, genetic or other biomarkers. 
Medical devices to be commercially distributed in the United States must receive from the FDA either clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), or premarket approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, pursuant to the FDC Act prior to marketing, unless subject to an exemption. Devices deemed to pose relatively low risk are placed in either Class I or II. Placement of a device into Class II generally requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) seeking clearance for commercial distribution; this is known as the 510(k) clearance process. Class III devices that were on the market before May 28, 1976 and for which FDA has not yet required submission of PMAs are also required to submit a 510(k) to FDA. Most Class I devices are exempted from this premarket submission requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices and some diagnostic tests, are placed into Class III requiring PMA approval. Devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device or novel devices for which no predicate device exists are placed into Class III, but may be reclassified by FDA into Class I or Class II upon the submission by the manufacturer of a de novo reclassification application. A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application or de novo application, and in many cases is required for a 510(k) application. All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with applicable FDA or Institutional Review Board, or IRB, regulations. Further, instrumentation intended for clinical multiplex test systems that meet the identification requirements under 21 CFR 862.2570 are considered Class II medical devices, subject to special controls, but are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification procedures. Such special controls are described in FDA’s guidance document entitled “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Instrumentation for Clinical Multiplex Test Systems.”
510(k) Clearance Pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating to the FDA’s satisfaction that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in technological 
characteristics to a previously 510(k) cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of PMA applications, or to a device that has received de novo authorization. The previously cleared device is known as a predicate. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from six to 12 months, but it can take significantly longer, particularly for a novel type of product. The FDA will also not begin a substantive review of the filing until it verifies the application contains all necessary information required to commence a substantive review. If the application does not contain all required information, the FDA will not file the application and return it to the submitter, highlighting the deficiencies in the application.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the agency may require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. If the modified device has been commercialized, the FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
PMA Approval Pathway. The PMA approval pathway requires a demonstration of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. The PMA approval pathway is costly, lengthy and uncertain.
A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data and also information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, which impose stringent testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
Upon submission, the FDA determines if the PMA application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and, if so, the application is accepted for filing. The FDA then commences an in-depth review of the PMA application. The PMA approval process typically takes one to three years, but may last longer. The review time is often significantly extended as a result of the FDA asking for more information or clarification of information already provided. The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions that the FDA believes are necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, post-approval studies and restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval or placement of restrictions on the sale of the device until the conditions are satisfied. Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA may require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.
De Novo Pathway. If no predicate can be identified, the product is automatically classified as Class III, requiring a PMA. However, the FDA can reclassify, or use “de novo classification” for, a device for which there was no predicate device if the device is low or moderate risk. A device company can also submit a de novo application at the outset, rather than submitting a 510(k) application for its particular product. When granting a de novo application the FDA will establish special controls that other applicants for the same device type must satisfy, which often includes labeling restrictions and data requirements. Subsequent applicants can rely upon the de novo product as a predicate for a 510(k) clearance. The de novo route has been used for many in vitro diagnostic products.
Postmarket. After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the quality manufacturing requirements set forth in the QSR, labeling regulations, the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off label” uses, registration and listing, the Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act).
The FDA enforces these requirements by unannounced inspection, market surveillance and other means. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an untitled regulatory letter or a warning letter, to more severe sanctions such as fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and criminal prosecution. For additional information, see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Government Regulation.”
Products Labeled for Research Use Only (RUO). RUO products are not regulated as medical devices and are therefore not subject to the QSR requirements enforced by the FDA. The FDA instead imposes labeling and distribution requirements with respect to RUO products. The products must bear the statement: “For Research Use Only. Not for Use in Diagnostic Procedures.” RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility, or clinical 
applications, and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance on products labeled RUO, which, among other things, reaffirmed that a company may not make any clinical or diagnostic claims about an RUO product, stating that merely including an RUO labeling statement will not necessarily render the device exempt from the FDA’s clearance, approval, or other regulatory requirements if the totality of circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicates that the manufacturer knows its product is being used by customers for diagnostic uses or the manufacturer intends such as use.
If FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our RUO products are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical devices that will require clearance or approval prior to commercialization. We continue to monitor the changing legal and regulatory landscape to ensure our compliance with any applicable rules, laws and regulations. Violation of any FDA regulatory requirements could result in regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, or fines, among other adverse actions.
Dual-Use Instruments. Dual-use instruments are subject to FDA regulation since they are intended, at least in part, for use by customers performing clinical diagnostic testing. In November 2014, FDA issued a guidance that described FDA’s approach to regulating molecular diagnostic instruments that combine in a single molecular instrument both approved/cleared device functions and device functions for which approval/clearance is not required.
Laboratory Developed Tests. Laboratory Developed Tests, or LDTs, are developed, validated and used within a single laboratory. In the past, the FDA generally exercised its enforcement discretion for LDTs and did not require clearance or approval prior to marketing. On October 3, 2014, FDA issued two draft guidances that proposed to actively regulate LDTs using a risk-based approach, and would have required 510(k)s or PMAs for certain “moderate” or “high” risk devices. However, in late November 2016, FDA announced that it would not be finalizing the 2014 draft LDT Guidances. More recently, the FDA has issued warning letters to genomics labs for illegally marketing genetic tests that claim to predict patients’ responses to specific medications, noting that the FDA has not created a legal “carve-out” for LDTs and retains discretion to take action when appropriate, such as when certain genomic tests raise significant public health concerns. As manufacturers develop more complex genetic tests and diagnostic software, the FDA may increase its regulation of LDTs. In August 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced rescission of guidances and other informal issuances of the FDA regarding premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, stating that, absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, those seeking approval or clearance of, or an emergency use authorization, or EUA, for an LDT may nonetheless voluntarily submit a premarket approval application, premarket notification or an EUA request, respectively, but are not required to do so. In November 2021, HHS under the Biden administration issued a statement that withdrew the August 2020 policy announcement, stating that HHS does not have a policy on LDTs that is separate from FDA’s longstanding approach.
Companion Diagnostics. In August 2014, FDA issued a companion diagnostics final guidance stating that if the device is essential to the safety or efficacy of the drug, FDA will generally require approval or clearance for the device at the time when FDA approves the drug. Most companion diagnostics will require PMA approval. FDA has also issued draft guidances on principles for co-development of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product in July 2016 and on developing and labeling in vitro companion diagnostic devices for a specific group or class of oncology therapeutic products in December 2018.
Further, in June 2021, Congress introduced an updated legislation called the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development Act (VALID Act), which, if enacted, will establish a new risk-based regulatory framework for in vitro clinical tests (IVCTs), which include IVDs, LDTs, collection devices, and instruments used with such tests, and a technology certification program, among other proposals. The adoption of new restrictions on IVDs, LDTs, or RUOs, whether by the FDA or Congress, could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and the demand for our specialized reagents and instruments. It is unclear whether the VALID Act or any other legislative proposals would be passed by Congress or signed into law by the President.
International
To the extent we decide to seek regulatory marketing authorization for certain of our products in countries outside of the United States, we or our partners, or collaborators, will need to obtain regulatory marketing authorization for our products for the intended use in the jurisdiction where such products will be marketed. Regulatory clearance or approval in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory marketing authorization in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Sales of such products outside the United States will likely be subject to foreign regulatory requirements, which can vary greatly from country to country, as well as FDA regulations on export of medical devices. The European Commission has adopted numerous directives and standards that address regulation of the design, manufacture, labeling, clinical studies and post-market vigilance for medical devices. Under the centralized authorization procedure, devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the European Union and European Economic Area member states. The European Medical Device Regulation (MDR), which will replace Europe’s Medical Device Directive (MDD), will be effective on May 26, 2021. Additionally, the In Vitro Diagnostic 
Regulation (IVDR 2017/746), which addresses several weaknesses of the In Vitro Diagnostic Directive (IVDD 98/79/EC), will apply starting on May 26, 2022.
In September 2012, Prosigna was CE-marked for compliance with IVDD 98/79/EC for use in conjunction with a diagnostic version of our nCounter Analysis System in the EU to assess a breast cancer patient’s risk of distant recurrence.
Reimbursement
Our nCounter FLEX Analysis Systems are purchased by clinical laboratories, which use our diagnostic products as the basis for testing patients’ samples. These customers can use our products to enable commercial testing services, and generate revenue for their laboratories for this service. In order to collect payment for testing services based upon our diagnostic products, clinical laboratory customers may bill third parties, including public and private payors. The demand for our diagnostic products will depend indirectly upon the ability for our customers to successfully bill for and receive reimbursement from third-party payors for the clinical testing services based on our products. 
United States
In the United States, clinical laboratory revenue is derived from various third-party payors, including insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Clinical laboratory testing services are paid through various methodologies when covered by third-party payors, such as prospective payment systems and fee schedules. For any new clinical test, payment for the clinical laboratory service requires a decision by the third-party payor to cover the particular test, the establishment of a reimbursement rate for the test and the identification of one or more Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes that accurately describe the test.
For Medicare, the reimbursement rates for individual tests are established under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (local fee schedules for outpatient clinical laboratory services) or the Physician Fee Schedule, depending on the amount of physician work involved in the test. Molecular diagnostic tests are paid under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. For additional information, see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Government Regulation.”
Outside the United States
In Europe, governments are primarily responsible for reimbursing diagnostic testing services. A relatively small portion of the market is made up of private payors and cash-pay patients. The primary barrier of adoption of a new in vitro diagnostic test is often reimbursement, and public reimbursement can take several years to achieve, depending on the country. Public reimbursement for genomic testing for breast cancer is available in Canada, Ireland, France, Greece, Switzerland, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Selected private coverage for testing is available in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France, the UAE and Hungary. Reimbursement approval in some countries, such as Spain and Italy, is managed at the regional level. Israel is a market in which genomic testing for breast cancer is widely reimbursed by all four major Sick Funds, the third-party payors that cover a substantial majority of the population. We will tailor our approaches to reimbursement and market access throughout the rest of the world as appropriate as we evaluate new product and service offerings.
Other Government Regulations
Our operations in the United States and abroad are subject to various fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal anti-kickback statute and state and federal marketing compliance laws in the United States. These laws may impact our operations directly, or indirectly through our contractors, agents or customers, and may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to various privacy laws and regulations of both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following federal laws and their counterparts at the state level:
•the Federal Anti-kickback Statute and state anti-kickback prohibitions;
•the Federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, and state equivalents;
•the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, commonly known as HIPAA;
•state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act;
•the Medicare civil money penalty laws and exclusion requirements;
•the Federal False Claims Act, civil and criminal penalties and state equivalents;
•the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which applies to our international activities; 
•the Physician Payments Sunshine Act; and
•the European Union’s General Data Privacy Regulation, or GDPR.
Violation of any such requirements and other laws that apply to our operations, including activities of our contractors and partners, may result in significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain clearances or approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, and reputational harm.
Environmental Matters
Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.
