Our Business Drivers
Factors that drive demand for our business offerings include:
•Developing Markets. The growth of multinational companies and global consolidation can precipitate antitrust and competition scrutiny and the spread internationally of issues and practices that historically have been more common in the U.S., such as increased and complex litigation, corporate restructuring and bankruptcy activities, and antitrust and competition scrutiny. Companies in the developing world and multinational companies can benefit from our expert advice to access capital and business markets, comply with the regulatory and other requirements of multiple countries, structure transactions and conduct due diligence, which drives demand for the services of all of our segments.
•Financial Markets. Financial market factors, including credit and financing availability, terms and conditions, the willingness of financial institutions to provide debt modifications or relief, corporate debt levels, default rates and capital markets transactions, are significant drivers of demand for our business offerings, particularly our Corporate Finance segment.
•Litigation and Disputes. Litigation and business disputes, the complexity of the issues presented, and the amount of potential damages and penalties drive demand for the services offered by many of our segments, particularly our FLC, Economic Consulting and Technology segments. Law firms and their clients, as well as government regulators and other interested third parties, rely on independent outside resources to evaluate claims, facilitate discovery, assess damages, provide expert reports and testimony, manage the pre-trial and in-trial process, and effectively present evidence.
•M&A Activity. M&A activity is an important driver for all of our segments. We offer services across all phases of the M&A life cycle. Our services during the pre-transaction phase include government competition advice and pre-transaction analysis. Our services during the negotiation phase include due diligence, negotiation and other transaction advisory services, government competition and antitrust regulation services, expert witness testimony, asset valuations and financial communications advice. Our services following the close of a transaction include post-M&A integration, transformation and disputes services.
•Operational Challenges and Opportunities. Operational challenges and opportunities drive demand for services across all of our segments. Businesses facing challenges require the evaluation and re-evaluation of strategy, risks and opportunities as a result of crisis-driven situations, competition, regulation, innovation and other events that arise in the course of business. These challenges include enterprise risk management, global expansion, competition from established companies, emerging businesses and technologies doing business in emerging markets, and new and changing regulatory requirements and legislation. Management, companies and their boards need outside help to recognize, understand and evaluate such events and effect change, which drives demand for independent expertise that can combine general business acumen with the specialized technical expertise of our service offerings and industry expertise. 
•Regulatory Complexity, Public Scrutiny and Investigations. Regulatory complexity, public scrutiny and investigations drive demand for services across all of our segments. Increasingly complex global regulations and legislation, greater scrutiny of corporate governance, instances of corporate malfeasance, and more stringent and complex reporting requirements drive demand for our service offerings. The need to understand and address the impact of regulation and legislation, as well as the increasing costs of doing business, has prompted companies to focus on better assessment and management of risks and opportunities. In addition, boards of directors, audit committees and independent board committees have been increasingly tasked with conducting internal investigations of financial wrongdoing, regulatory non-compliance and other issues. These factors and laws, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the U.S., have contributed to the demand for independent consultants and experts to investigate and provide analyses to support the work of outside legal counsel, accountants and other advisors. These types of investigations also increasingly demand the use of multiple disciplinary service offerings like ours, which combine skills and capabilities across segments and practices with industry expertise. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We compete primarily on the basis of the breadth of our services, the quality of our work, the prominence of our professionals, our geographic reach, our reputation and performance record, our specialized industry expertise and our strong client relationships. We believe our success is driven by a combination of long-standing competitive strengths, including:

Our broad range of practices and services, the diversity of our revenue streams, our specialized industry expertise and our global reach distinguish us from our competitors. This diversity helps to mitigate the impact of crises, events and changes in a particular practice, industry or country.
•Diversified Portfolio of Elite Clients. We provide services to a diverse group of clients, including Fortune 500 companies, FTSE 100 companies, global financial institutions, banks, private equity funds and local, state and national governments and agencies in the U.S. and other countries. Additionally, 98 of the top 100 law firms as ranked by American Lawyer Global 100: Most Revenue List refer or engage us directly or on behalf of numerous clients on multiple matters. We are also an advisor to 59 of the Fortune 100 companies, nine of the world's top 10 bank holding companies and 7 of the top 10 private equity firms on the Private Equity International 300 list. 
•Demand for Integrated Solutions and a Consultative Approach. Our breadth and depth of practice and service offerings and industry expertise across the globe drive demand by clients that seek our integrated services and consultative approach covering different aspects of event-driven occurrences, reputational issues and transactions across different jurisdictions.
•Strong Cash Flow. Our business model has several characteristics that produce consistent cash flows. Our strong cash flow supports business operations, capital expenditures, and our ability to service our indebtedness and pursue our growth and other strategies.
Our Business Strategy
We build client relationships based on the quality of our services, our brand and the reputation of our professionals. We provide diverse complementary services to meet our clients’ needs around the world. We emphasize client service and satisfaction. We aim to build strong brand recognition. The following are key elements of our business strategy:
•Leverage Our Practitioners' and Businesses' Expertise, Geographic Reach, Diverse Service Offerings and Client Relationships. We work hard to maintain and strengthen our core practices and competencies. We believe that our recognized expertise, geographic reach, diverse service offerings and client relationships, coupled with our successful track record of serving as a trusted advisor for our clients when they are facing their greatest challenges and 
opportunities, are the most critical elements in a decision to retain us. Many of our professionals are recognized experts in their respective field.
•Grow Organically. Our strategy is to identify where we are best positioned to help our clients solve their most complex issues, invest behind those positions and leverage that success to grow organically.
•Strategic Acquisitions. We consider strategic and opportunistic acquisition opportunities on a selective basis. We seek to integrate completed acquisitions and manage investments in a way that fosters organic growth, expands our geographic presence or complements our segments, practices, services and industry positions. We typically structure our acquisitions to retain the services of key individuals from the acquired companies. 
•Enhance Profitability. We endeavor to leverage our investments to build positions that will support profitable growth on a sustained basis through a variety of economic conditions. 
•Enhance Value through Capital Allocation. The strength of our balance sheet gives us the flexibility to allocate capital and create shareholder value in numerous ways, including investments in organic growth, share repurchases and acquisitions, among other capital allocation vehicles. 
•Marketing. We rely primarily on our senior professionals to identify and pursue business opportunities. Referrals from clients, law firms and other intermediaries and our reputation from prior engagements are also key factors in securing new business. Our professionals often learn about new business opportunities from their frequent contact and close working relationships with clients. In marketing our services, we emphasize our experience, the quality of our services and our professionals’ particular areas of expertise, as well as our ability to quickly staff large engagements across multiple jurisdictions. While we aggressively seek new business opportunities, we maintain high professional standards and carefully evaluate potential new client relationships and engagements before accepting them. 
•ESG & Sustainability. At FTI Consulting, we believe proactively identifying and addressing ESG-related risks and opportunities are integral to sustaining our growth trajectory and critical to maintaining our competitive position in today's dynamic market. As a professional services firm that is not a significant greenhouse gas emitter, FTI Consulting’s environmental impact is primarily driven by two factors: our business travel and leased office locations. Nonetheless, FTI Consulting has committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas GHG emissions by 2030. To remain transparent about our ESG practices, FTI Consulting has disclosed ESG metrics according to several reporting frameworks, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. Additionally, we are a participant of the United Nations (“UN”) Global Compact and support its Ten Principles on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. To learn more about our commitment to ESG and our sustainability journey, see our 2020 Corporate Sustainability Report, available on our website under about FTI–Diversity Inclusion & Belonging–Corporate Sustainability Report 2020.
Human Capital Resources
At FTI Consulting, we seek to provide the highest quality services to our clients. We do this by attracting and retaining experts in their field, empowering a diverse and inclusive global workforce, providing opportunities for advancement and personal growth, and supporting the communities in which we do business. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 6,780 employees, of which 5,401 were revenue-generating professionals. We also engage independent contractors, who exclusively provide services to FTI Consulting, to supplement our professionals on client engagements as needed.
We advance the best interests of all our stakeholders through:
•Attracting and Retaining Highly Qualified Professionals. Our professionals are crucial to delivering our services to clients and generating new business. Through our substantial staff of highly qualified professionals, we can handle a large number of complex global assignments simultaneously. To attract and retain highly qualified professionals, we offer various compensation opportunities, including sign-on bonuses, forgivable loans, retention bonuses, cash incentive bonuses and equity compensation, along with a competitive benefits package and the opportunity to work on challenging global engagements with highly skilled peers.
•Experts-Driven Model. Our professionals include PhDs, MBAs, JDs, CPAs, CPA-ABVs (CPAs accredited in business valuations), CPA-CFFs (CPAs certified in financial forensics), CRAs (certified risk analysts), Certified Turnaround Professionals, Certified Insolvency and Reorganization Advisors, Certified Fraud Examiners, ASAs (accredited senior appraisers), construction engineers and former senior government officials.
•Inclusive and High-Performing Culture. We foster a culture where our professionals can grow their careers and achieve their full potential. We also hire and strive to retain professionals with the diverse set of qualities, background and expertise that our clients and teams need. We offer robust Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging programs and training opportunities to our employees across the globe at every level.
•Talent Development. We support the development of our professionals at all levels of their careers. Our robust Talent Development program includes induction programs for new hires, milestone programs to prepare promotes for success in their new role and leadership readiness programs to help our people build the skills needed to advance to our most senior positions. These training programs are further supplemented by self-directed e-learning programs, among other segment-level talent development and training opportunities. 
•Corporate Citizenship. We practice responsible corporate citizenship to drive positive change in the communities in which we do business. All full-time FTI Consulting employees are eligible to participate in our Corporate Citizenship program, which includes charitable gift matching, paid time off for volunteering and corporate-sponsored pro bono engagements.
Employment Agreements
As of December 31, 2021, we had written employment agreements with substantially all of our 650 Senior Managing Directors and equivalent personnel (collectively, “SMD”). These arrangements generally provide for fixed salary and eligibility for incentive payment programs (which, in some cases, may be based on financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, revenues or relative total shareholder return), salary continuation benefits, accrued bonuses and other benefits beyond the termination date if an SMD leaves our employment for specified reasons prior to the expiration date of the employment agreement. The length and amount of payments to be paid by us following the termination or resignation of an SMD will vary, depending on whether the employee resigned with or without “good reason” or was terminated by us with or without “cause,” retired or did not renew, died or became “disabled,” or was terminated as a result of a “change in control” (all such terms as defined in such SMD’s employment agreement). All of our written employment agreements with SMDs specify the required notice period to be given by us or the SMD prior to termination of employment and include covenants providing for restrictions on the SMD competing against, and soliciting employees from, the Company for a specified period of time following the end of the SMD's employment.
Incentive, Retention and Sign-on Payments
Our SMDs, consultants and other professionals may receive incentive, retention or sign-on payments through unsecured general recourse forgivable loans, equity awards and/or other payments (collectively, “Retention Awards”). We believe that providing these multi-year Retention Awards greatly enhances our ability to attract and retain key professionals.  
Some or all of the principal amount and accrued interest of the loans we make will be forgiven by us upon the passage of time, or their repayment will be funded by us through additional cash bonus compensation, provided that the recipient is an employee or consultant on the forgiveness date. In addition, upon certain termination events, accrued interest and the outstanding principal balance may be forgiven, including upon death, disability and, in some cases, retirement or termination by the Company without cause or the recipient with good reason. The recipient may be required to repay the unpaid accrued interest and outstanding principal balance upon certain other termination events such as voluntary resignation, as provided in the applicable promissory note. The value of the forgivable loans we have made, in the aggregate, as well as on an individual basis, has been, and we anticipate will continue to be, significant. Our executive officers and outside directors are not eligible to receive loans, and no loans have been made to them.
Recipients of sign-on or other retention payments, other than loans, may be required to repay a portion or all of the original payment upon certain termination events. These awards are typically smaller amounts in nature than forgivable loans and have a shorter service requirement than forgivable loans.
Our executive officers, other members of senior management and outside directors, as well as employees and independent service providers, have received and will continue to receive equity awards, which may include stock options and share-based awards (including awards in the form of restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock units, deferred restricted stock units, and cash-settled stock appreciation rights and units), on a case-by-case basis, to the extent that shares are available under our stockholder-approved equity compensation plans. The value of such equity and cash-based awards, in the aggregate, as well as on an individual basis, has been and is expected to continue to be significant.
Select SMDs may participate in certain incentive compensation programs, such as the Key Senior Managing Director Incentive Plan (the “KSIP”) or our Senior Managing Director Incentive Compensation Program (the “ICP”). The ICP was closed to new participants effective January 2015. Participants in the KSIP are recommended by management and approved by 
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. The KSIP and ICP provide for a combination of forgivable loans, equity awards and retention bonuses that are paid over a range of four to 10 years depending on the program and economic value of the award. These programs may require participants to defer a portion of their bonus in the form of cash or restricted stock over a two- to three-year period.
Clients
During the year ended December 31, 2021, no single client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, and no reportable segment had a single client that accounted for more than 10% of its respective total segment revenues. In some cases, we may have engagements through law firms that represent a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues or the revenues of a segment; however, in these situations, each law firm engages us on behalf of multiple clients.
Competition
We compete with different companies or businesses of companies depending on the particular nature of a proposed engagement and the requested types of service(s) or the location of the client or delivery of the service(s) or product(s). Our businesses are highly competitive. Our competitors include large organizations, such as the global accounting firms and large management and financial consulting companies, that offer a broad range of consulting services; investment banking firms; information technology ("IT") consulting and software companies that offer niche services that are the same or similar to services or products offered by one or more of our segments and small firms and independent contractors that provide one or more specialized services.
We compete primarily on the basis of the breadth of our services, the quality of our work, the prominence of our professionals, our geographic reach, our reputation and performance record, our specific industry expertise, our ability to staff multiple significant engagements across disciplines and industries in multiple locations, and our strong client relationships. Our Technology segment, particularly with respect to hosting and e-discovery services, and to a lesser extent our other segments, may also compete on price, although the critical nature of the services provided by our Corporate Finance, FLC and Economic Consulting segments typically makes price a secondary consideration. Since our businesses depend in large part on professional relationships, there are low barriers of entry for professionals, including our professionals, electing to work independently, start their own firms or change employers.
Our Corporate Finance segment primarily competes with specialty boutiques and publicly traded companies providing restructuring, bankruptcy and M&A services and, to a lesser extent, large investment banks and global accounting firms.
Our FLC segment primarily competes with other large consulting companies and global accounting firms with service offerings similar to ours.
Our Economic Consulting segment primarily competes with individually recognized economists, specialty boutiques and large consulting companies with service offerings similar to ours.
Our Technology segment primarily competes with consulting and/or software providers specializing in e-discovery, electronically stored information and the management of electronic content. Competitors may offer products and/or services intended to address one piece or more of those areas. There continues to be significant consolidation of companies providing products and services similar to our Technology segment, through M&A and other transactions, which may provide competitors access to greater financial and other resources than those of FTI Consulting. This industry is subject to significant and rapid innovation. Larger competitors may be able to react more quickly to new regulatory or legal requirements and other changes and may be able to innovate more quickly and efficiently.
Our Strategic Communications segment competes with large public relations firms, as well as boutique M&A, crisis communications and public affairs firms.
Some service providers are larger than we are and, on certain engagements, may have an advantage over us with respect to one or more competitive factors. Specialty boutiques or smaller local or regional firms, while not offering the range of services we provide, may compete with us on the basis of geographic proximity, specialty services or pricing advantages.
