ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
We are a master limited partnership formed on March 16, 2015 to manage and further develop all of our sponsor's active coal operations in Pennsylvania. All amounts except per unit or per ton are displayed in thousands.
At December 31, 2018, our assets are comprised of a 25% undivided interest in, and operational control over, the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, which consists of three underground mines and related infrastructure that produce high-British thermal unit (“Btu”) coal that is sold primarily to electric utilities in the eastern United States. We are a leading producer of high-Btu coal in the Northern Appalachian Basin and the eastern United States due to our ability to efficiently produce and deliver large volumes of high-quality coal at competitive prices, the strategic location of our mines, the industry experience of our management team and our relationship with CONSOL Energy.
The Pennsylvania Mining Complex, which includes the Bailey Mine, the Enlow Fork Mine and the Harvey Mine, has extensive high-quality coal reserves. We mine our reserves from the Pittsburgh No. 8 Coal Seam, which is a large contiguous formation of uniform, high-Btu coal that is ideal for high-productivity, low-cost longwall operations. As of December 31, 2018, our portion of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex included 174,625 tons of recoverable coal reserves with an average gross heat content of approximately 12,907 Btus per pound and approximately 3.6 pounds of sulfur dioxide (“SO2”) per million British thermal units (“lb SO2/mmBtu”). Based on our current production capacity, these reserves are sufficient to support approximately 25 years of production. In addition, our reserves currently exhibit thermoplastic behavior suitable for cokemaking, which enables us, if market dynamics are favorable, to capture greater margins from selling our coal as a crossover product in the high-vol metallurgical market to cokemakers and steel manufacturers who utilize modern cokemaking technologies.

The design of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex is optimized to produce large quantities of coal on a cost-efficient basis. We are able to sustain high production volumes at comparatively low operating costs due to, among other things, our technologically advanced longwall mining systems, logistics infrastructure and safety. All of our mines utilize longwall mining, which is a highly automated underground mining technique that produces large volumes of coal at lower costs compared to other underground mining methods. We typically operate five longwalls and 15-17 continuous mining sections at the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. The current production capacity of our portion of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex’s five longwalls is 7,125 tons of coal per year. The preparation plant is connected via conveyor belts to each of our mines and cleans and processes up to 8,200 tons of coal per hour. Our on-site logistics infrastructure at the preparation plant includes a dual-batch train loadout facility capable of loading up to 9,000 tons of coal per hour and 19.3 miles of track linked to separate Class I rail lines owned by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ transportation needs.
On July 1, 2015, our common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CNXC”. On July 7, 2015, the Partnership completed the issuance of common units in connection with the IPO, a private placement of common units with Greenlight Capital, and entered into a $400,000 senior secured revolving credit facility. In connection with the IPO, our former sponsor contributed to the Partnership a 20% undivided interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses comprising the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. 
On September 30, 2016, we acquired an additional 5% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex from our former sponsor for $21,500 in cash and the issuance of 3,956,496 Class A Preferred Units with a value of $67,300. All information (except distributable cash flow, which reflects the ownership percentage at the time) included within this filing has been recast to reflect the Partnership’s current 25% undivided interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses comprising the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. On October 2, 2017, all of the Class A Preferred Units were converted into common units on a one-for-one basis.
  On November 28, 2017, CONSOL Energy was separated from our former sponsor into an independent publicly traded coal company (NYSE: CEIX). In connection with the separation, our former sponsor transferred to CONSOL Energy all of its ownership interest in our general partner and us, which consists of (i) 5,006,496 common units and 11,611,067 subordinated units, (ii) a 1.7% general partnership interest and (iii) all incentive distribution rights (IDRs). CONSOL Energy's coal business includes its 75% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, terminal operations at the Port of Baltimore and undeveloped coal reserves located in the Northern Appalachian Basin, Central Appalachian Basin and Illinois Basin and certain related coal assets and liabilities.

Our primary strategy for growing our business and increasing distributions to our unitholders is to increase operating efficiencies to maximize realizations and make acquisitions that increase our distributable cash flow. The primary component of our growth strategy is based upon our expectation of future divestitures by CONSOL Energy to us of portions of its retained 75% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. 
  Our principal executive offices are located at 1000 CONSOL Energy Drive, Suite 100, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317-6506, and our telephone number is (724) 416-8300. Our website is located at www.ccrlp.com. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and does not constitute a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Organization Structure
The following simplified diagram depicts our organizational structure and our relationship with CONSOL Energy as of December 31, 2018:

Our Relationship with CONSOL Energy
One of our principal strengths is our relationship with our sponsor, CONSOL Energy. CONSOL Energy is a leading, low-cost producer of high-quality coal, headquartered in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. CONSOL Energy and its former parent and predecessors have been mining coal, primarily in the Appalachian Basin, since 1864. CONSOL Energy deploys an organic growth strategy focused on efficiently developing its resource base. CONSOL Energy’s premium coal grades are sold to electricity generators, steel makers, coke producers and industrial consumers, both domestically and internationally. CONSOL Energy is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “CEIX” and had a market capitalization of approximately $870.1 million as of December 31, 2018. 
Our Assets
CONSOL Thermal Holdings owns a 25% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. CONSOL Thermal Holdings entered into an operating agreement with CPCC and Conrhein under which CONSOL Thermal Holdings is named as operator and assumes management and control over the day-to-day operations of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex for the life of the mines. We are managed by the directors and executive officers of our general partner. As a result, the directors and executive officers of our general partner have the ultimate responsibility for managing and conducting all of our and our subsidiaries’ operations, including with respect to CONSOL Thermal Holdings’ rights and obligations under the operating agreement. Based on our current production capacity utilizing five longwall mining systems, our recoverable coal reserves are sufficient to support approximately 25 years of production.
Our Operations
Bailey Mine
The Bailey Mine is located in Enon, Pennsylvania. The Bailey Mine is the first mine developed at the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. As of December 31, 2018, the Partnership’s portion of the Bailey Mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 40,832 tons of recoverable coal reserves with an average as-received gross heat content of approximately 12,890 Btus per pound and an approximate average lb SO2/mmBtu of 4.1. Construction of the slope and initial air shaft began in 1982. The slope development reached the coal seam at a depth of approximately 600 feet and, following development of the slope bottom, commercial coal production began in 1984. Longwall mining production commenced in 1985, and the second longwall was placed into operation in 1987. In 2010, a new slope and overland belt system was commissioned, which allowed a large percentage of the Bailey Mine to be sealed off. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our portion of the Bailey Mine produced 3,184 tons, 3,031 tons and 3,014 tons of coal, respectively. The Bailey Mine uses approximately six to seven continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. 
 Enlow Fork Mine
The Enlow Fork Mine is located directly north of the Bailey Mine. As of December 31, 2018, the Partnership’s portion of the Enlow Fork Mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 83,407 tons of recoverable coal reserves with an average as-received gross heat content of approximately 12,935 Btus per pound and an approximate average lb SO2/mmBtu of 3.2. Initial underground development was started from the Bailey Mine while the Enlow Fork slope was being constructed. Once the slope bottom was developed and the slope belt became operational, seals were constructed to separate the two mines. Following development of the slope bottom, commercial coal production began in 1989. Longwall mining production commenced in 1991 with the second longwall coming online in 1992. In 2014, a new slope and overland belt system was commissioned and a substantial portion of the Enlow Fork Mine was sealed. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our portion of the Enlow Fork Mine produced 2,469 tons, 2,295 tons and 2,409 tons of coal, respectively. The Enlow Fork Mine uses approximately six to seven continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. 
Harvey Mine
The Harvey Mine is located directly east of the Bailey and Enlow Fork Mines. As of December 31, 2018, the Partnership’s portion of the Harvey Mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 50,386 tons of recoverable coal reserves with an average as-received gross heat content of approximately 12,873 Btus per pound and an approximate average lb SO2/mmBtu of 3.8. Similar to the Enlow Fork Mine, the Harvey Mine was developed off of the Bailey Mine’s slope bottom. Once the slope for the Harvey Mine was placed into operation, seals were built to separate the two mines, and the original slope was dedicated solely to the Harvey Mine, which eliminated the need to make significant capital expenditures to develop, among other things, a new slope, air shaft and portal facility. Development of the Harvey Mine began 
8

in 2009, and construction of the supporting surface facilities commenced in 2011. Longwall mining production commenced in March 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our portion of the Harvey Mine produced 1,245 tons, 1,201 tons and 743 tons of coal, respectively. The Harvey Mine uses approximately three continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. The Harvey Mine’s existing infrastructure, including its bottom development, slope belt and material handling system, has the capacity to add one incremental permanent longwall mining system with additional mine development and capital investment.
Capital Expenditures
In 2019, the Partnership expects to invest $34,000-$38,000 in maintenance capital expenditures, which is increased from 2018 levels due to additional expected capital expenditures related to airshaft construction projects, as well as additional belt system related expenditures.
Our Customers and Contracts
We sell coal to an established customer base through opportunities as a result of strong business relationships or through a formalized bidding process. We refer to the contracts under which coal produced from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex is sold and which a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy administers under the contract agency agreement at our direction as “our contracts”. We are greater than 95% contracted for 2019, 53% contracted for 2020 and 28% contracted for 2021, assuming an annual production rate of approximately 6,750 tons. With our planned coal production in 2019 largely sold out, our focus now has shifted to maximizing realizations for any additional production and booking additional sales for contract years 2020 and 2021. Our contracted position includes a mix of sales to our top domestic customers and to the thermal and metallurgical export markets, maintaining our diversified market exposure and providing a solid revenue base for meeting our long-term market strategy.
The sales commitments under contract are our expected sales tons and can fluctuate up or down due to provisions contained within our contracts. The contractual time commitments for customers to nominate future purchase volumes under our contracts are typically sufficient to allow us to balance our sales commitments with prospective production capacity or incremental sales volume. In addition, the commitments can change because of reopener provisions contained in certain of these long-term contracts.  For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately 68%, 68% and 80%, respectively, of all the coal produced from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex was sold under contracts with terms of one year or more.
The provisions of our contracts are the results of both bidding procedures and extensive negotiations with each customer. As a result, the provisions of our contracts vary significantly in many respects, including, among other factors, price adjustment features, price and contract reopener terms, force majeure provisions, coal qualities and quantities. Our contracts typically stipulate procedures for transportation of coal, quality control, sampling and weighing. Most contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within stated ranges for specific coal characteristics such as heat, sulfur, ash, moisture, grindability, volatile matter content and other qualities. Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, rejection or suspension of shipments or termination of the contracts. Although the volume to be delivered pursuant to a long-term contract is stipulated, the customers often have the option to vary the volume within specified limits.
Substantially all of our multi-year sales contracts contain base prices, subject only to pre-established adjustment mechanisms based primarily on (i) variances in the quality characteristics of coal delivered to the customer beyond threshold quality characteristics specified in the applicable sales contract, (ii) the actual calorific value of coal delivered to the customer, and/or (iii) changes in electric power prices in the markets in which our customers operate, as adjusted for any factors set forth in the applicable contract. The electric power price-related adjustments, if any, result only in positive monthly adjustments to the contracted base price that we receive for our coal. Price reopener provisions are present in several of our multi-year sales contracts. These price reopener provisions may automatically set a new price prospectively based on prevailing market price or, in some instances, require the parties to agree on a new price, sometimes within a specified range of prices. In a limited number of agreements, failure of the parties to agree on a price under a price reopener provision can lead to termination of the contract.  Under some of our contracts, we have the right to match lower prices offered to our customers by other suppliers.  Some of the long-term contracts also permit the contract to be reopened for renegotiation of terms and conditions other than pricing terms, and where a mutually acceptable agreement on terms and conditions cannot be concluded, either party may have the option to terminate the contract.
Of our 2018 sales tons, approximately 68% were sold to U.S. electric generators, 29% were priced on export markets and 3% were sold to other domestic customers. In 2018, we derived greater than 10% of our total coal sales revenue from three 
9

customers. As of January 1, 2019, we had six sales agreements with these customers that expire at various times in 2019, 2020 and 2021.
Transportation Logistics and Infrastructure
We have developed a transportation and logistics network with dual rail transportation options that we believe provides us with operational and marketing flexibility, reduces the cost to deliver coal to our core market and allows us to realize higher free-on-board (“FOB”) mine prices. Most of our coal is sold FOB at the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, which means that our customers bear the transportation costs from the mining complex, and essentially all of our coal transported to our domestic customers or to an export terminal facility originates by rail. We believe our proximity to our core markets, dual rail transportation options, rail-to-barge access and customized on-site logistics infrastructure contribute to lower overall delivered costs for power plants in the eastern United States as a result of shorter transportation distances, access to diversified rail route options, higher rail car utilization, more efficient use of locomotive power and more predictable movement of product between mine and destination. In addition, we have favorable access to international coal markets through coal export terminals located on the U.S. east coast.
Seasonality
Our business has historically experienced limited variability in its results due to the effect of seasonal changes. Demand for coal-fired power can increase due to unusually hot or cold weather as power consumers use more air conditioning or heating, respectively. Conversely, mild weather can result in weaker demand for our coal. Adverse weather conditions, such as blizzards or floods, can impact our ability to transport coal over our overland conveyor systems and to transport our coal by rail.
Competition
The coal industry is highly competitive, with numerous producers selling into all markets that use coal. There are numerous large and small producers in all coal-producing basins of the United States, and we compete with many of these producers, including those who export coal abroad. Potential changes to international trade agreements, trade concessions or other political and economic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than the United States. We may be adversely impacted on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future may benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or other arrangements. In addition, coal is sold internationally in U.S. dollars and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide our foreign competitors with a competitive advantage. If our competitors’ currencies decline against the U.S. dollar or against our foreign customers’ local currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices for coal to our customers. Furthermore, if the currencies of our overseas customers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the U.S. dollar, those customers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell to them. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.
The most important factors on which we compete are coal price, coal quality and characteristics, transportation costs and reliability of supply. Demand for coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our coal are closely linked to coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric generation industry and foreign coal consumers. These coal consumption patterns are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control, including demand for electricity, which is significantly dependent upon economic activity and summer and winter temperatures in the United States, government regulation, technological developments and the location, quality, price and availability of competing sources of fuel.
 Competition from natural gas-fired plants that are relatively more efficient, less expensive to construct and less difficult to permit than coal-fired plants has the most potential to displace a significant amount of coal-fired electric power generation in the near term, particularly from older, less efficient coal-fired power generators. Federal and state mandates for increased use of electricity derived from renewable energy sources could affect demand for our coal. Such mandates, combined with other incentives to use renewable energy sources, such as tax credits, could make alternative fuel sources more competitive with coal.
Laws and Regulations
Overview
Our coal mining operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulations. Regulations relating to our operations require us to obtain permits and other licenses; reclaim and restore our properties after 
10

mining operations have been completed; store, transport and dispose of materials used or generated by our operations; manage surface subsidence from underground mining; control water and air emissions; protect wetlands and endangered plant and wildlife; and to ensure employee health and safety. Furthermore, the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which could affect demand for our coal. Compliance with these laws has substantially increased the cost of coal mining, and the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted, which would have a significant impact on our coal mining operations or our customers’ ability to use our coal and may require us or our customers to change their operations significantly or incur substantial costs.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations to which we and our customers’ business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations and financial position.
Environmental Laws
 Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect all aspects of coal mining operations, both directly and indirectly. The CAA directly impacts our coal mining operations through permitting and emission control requirements for the construction or modification of certain facilities. Indirectly, the CAA affects the U.S. coal industry by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants operated by our customers. 
Coal impurities are released into the air when coal is burned and the CAA regulates specific emissions, such as sulfur and mercury. These regulations restricting emissions from coal-fired electric generating plants increase the costs to operate and could affect demand for coal as a fuel source, therefore potentially affecting the volume of our sales. Moreover, additional environmental regulations increase the likelihood that existing coal-fired electric generating plants will be decommissioned— including plants the Partnership sells coal to—and reduce the likelihood that new coal-fired plants will be built in the future.
 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Rule. In 2012, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) promulgated or finalized several rules for New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) for coal and oil-fired power plants. NSPS are technology-based standards that vary depending on the particular source, such as a coal-fired electric generating plant, and can have a significant influence on the cost of using coal as a fuel source. EPA’s 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule (“MATS Rule”) established NSPS for coal-fired electric generating units for particulate matter (“PM”), sulfur dioxide (“SO2”) and nitrogen oxides (“NOX”). The MATS Rule also established national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (“NESHAP”) for coal-fired electric generating units for certain impurities such as mercury. Unlike pollutants regulated by an NSPS, pollutants regulated by a NESHAP require the maximum achievable control technology (“MACT”) be used to control emissions of the pollutant. The application of a MACT standard is generally more costly than other control technology standards, and prompted the closure of some facilities. The rule was challenged, ultimately rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 29, 2015 for failing to consider the costs imposed by the MATS Rule, and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) to determine whether to allow EPA to address the rule’s deficiencies or to vacate and nullify the rule. In April 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA's request to stay the case to allow the agency to fully review the rule. Nevertheless, many coal-fired electric power generators have already taken steps to comply with the MATS Rule as such required control and operational modifications can take significant time to install and/or implement. On December 28, 2018, EPA proposed to revise the 2016 supplemental cost finding for the MATS Rule, as well the related risk and technology review required by the CAA. Under the proposal, the emission standards and other requirements of the MATS Rule would remain in place while EPA’s methodology for assessing the costs and benefits of the rule were being modified.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The CAA requires EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for six pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment (“criteria pollutants”). In recent years, EPA has adopted more stringent NAAQS for these criteria pollutants, which could directly or indirectly impact mining operations through the identification of new non-attainment areas which could prompt local changes to permitting or emissions control requirements, as prescribed by federally mandated state implementation plans. The primary NAAQS set the permissible level of a particular criteria pollutant in the ambient air. In 2015, EPA finalized the NAAQS for ozone pollution and reduced the limit to 70 parts per billion (ppb) from the previous 75 ppb standard. The final rule was challenged in the D.C. Circuit. On April 7, 2017, EPA advised the D.C. Circuit that it intended to reconsider the final rule and the Court subsequently stayed the litigation pending further action by EPA. In August 2018, EPA ultimately decided not to revisit the rule. As a result, the D.C. Circuit lifted its stay of the 2015 ozone NAAQS rule imposing the 70 ppb ambient air quality standard.
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. On July 6, 2011, EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”). CSAPR regulates cross-border emissions of criteria air pollutants such as SO2, NOX, particulate matter (“PM2.5”) and ozone by requiring 
11

states to limit emissions from sources that “contribute significantly” to noncompliance with air quality standards. If the ambient levels of criteria air pollutants are above the thresholds set by EPA, a region is considered to be in “nonattainment” for that pollutant and EPA applies more stringent control standards for sources of air emissions located in the region. Implementation of CSAPR is being accomplished in phases: Phase 1 began in 2015 and Phase 2 began in 2017. In September 2016, EPA finalized revisions to the CSAPR. As of May 2017, this rule limits summertime NOX emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern United States, which may have an impact on how coal-fired electric-generating units are utilized in this region. 
Clean Power Plan. On September 20, 2013, EPA issued a new proposal, “Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants”, to establish separate NSPS for CO2 emissions for natural gas-fired turbines and coal-fired units. This rule was finalized in late 2015, immediately challenged by multiple parties, and in August 2017 was stayed by the D.C. Circuit to allow the Trump Administration's EPA to review the rule. 
In June 2014, EPA announced its Clean Power Plan (“CPP”) — intended to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants — and published a proposed rule for public comment. Under the CPP, EPA would create emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to address greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) — predominantly through CO2 emissions reductions — from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. However, following numerous challenges to the CPP, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the effective date of the CPP. Subsequently, on October 16, 2017, EPA formally proposed repeal of the CPP and later solicited comments on CO2 control measures that can be implemented at coal-fired electricity generating facilities.
In August 2018, EPA released a proposed rule to replace the CPP: the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule. The ACE rule sets GHG guidelines for states to ultimately establish emissions limits and standards for existing coal-fired electric generating facilities. The proposed ACE rule is less stringent than the CPP, as it does not establish emission reduction standards or targets for states; rather, the rule proposes a list of technologies that states can use to establish standards of performance for power generating units within their jurisdiction. EPA projects the ACE rule to result in no change in total electric generating capacity, and increased coal production for power sector use by 2025.
 National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to taking a “major Federal action”, which encompasses agencies’ decisions on our permitting applications and adoption of land management actions. When we propose activities that fall under federal jurisdiction, we are subject to NEPA reviews, which may create delays in project review and authorization timeframes, or increase the cost of compliance. In April 2017, pursuant to executive order, the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) — the federal agency charged with overseeing implementation of NEPA — withdrew its “Final Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Effects of Climate Change in National Environmental Policy Act Reviews.” This guidance previously directed agencies to consider proposed actions’ effects on climate change (including GHG emission), and may have created additional delays and costs in the NEPA review process for the energy industry that are now no longer in place. Additionally, pursuant to Executive Order 13807 issued in August 2017, the CEQ has issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on NEPA that seeks to streamline the NEPA process, while also minimizing unnecessary litigation, cost and delay for project proponents. The CEQ’s proposed revisions to NEPA have yet to be updated, though the comment period for the rulemaking closed August 2018. Nevertheless, certain Federal courts have held that GHGs must be considered under NEPA prior to a federal agency taking a “major Federal action.”
Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and corresponding state laws affect our coal operations by regulating discharges into certain waters, primarily through permitting. CWA permits — issued either by EPA or an analogous state agency — typically require regular monitoring and compliance with limitations on defined pollutants and reporting requirements. Specific to the Partnership's operations, CWA permits and corresponding state laws often require (1) treatment of discharges from coal mining properties for non-traditional pollutants, such as chlorides, selenium and dissolved solids and (2) requirements to dispose of produced wastes and other oil and gas wastes at approved disposal facilities. 
In order to obtain a permit for certain coal mining activities, including the construction of coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments, an operator may need to obtain a permit for the discharge of fill material from the Army Corps of Engineers (“ACOE”) and/or a discharge permit from the state regulatory authority under the state counterpart to the CWA. Beginning in early 2009, EPA took a number of initiatives that have resulted in delays and obstruction of the issuance of such permits for surface mining operations in the Appalachian states, including Pennsylvania where the Pennsylvania Mining Complex is located. Increased oversight of delegated state programmatic authority, coupled with individual permit review and additional requirements imposed by EPA, has resulted in delays in the review and issuance of permits. In addition, the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (“SPCC”) requirements of the CWA apply to all our operations that use or produce oil and require the implementation of plans to address any spills and the installation of secondary containment around all storage tanks. These requirements under the CWA and SPCC may cause us to incur significant additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
12

 Additionally, which waterbodies are subject to the CWA has been in dispute for years. In June 2015, EPA issued a rule to clarify which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction under the CWA, known as the Clean Water Rule. This rule was quickly challenged and nationwide implementation was blocked by a federal appeals court. The Clean Water Rule would impose additional permitting obligations on the Partnership's operations by increasing the number of waterbodies subject to CWA permitting and other regulations. On February 28, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order prompting EPA and ACOE to consider replacing the blocked Clean Water Rule. On December 11, 2018, EPA and the ACOE proposed a new regulation to determine which waterbodies are subject to federal jurisdiction. The new proposal would lessen the number of waterbodies subject to the CWA as compared to the Clean Water Rule.
On November 3, 2015, EPA published the final Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards (“ELG”) rule, revising the regulations for the Steam Electric Power Generating category which became effective on January 4, 2016. The rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants. On September 13, 2017, EPA finalized a rule postponing for two years certain applicability dates for specific waste streams subject to the effluent limitations. The applicability date of the stricter effluent limits is the subject of on-going litigation. Nevertheless, the combined effect of the Coal Combustion Residuals (“CCR”) rule (discussed below) and ELG regulations has compelled power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and may force the closure of certain older existing coal burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards.
 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and corresponding state laws and regulations affect coal mining by imposing requirements for the treatment, storage and disposal of certain wastes created throughout the coal mining process. Facilities where certain regulated wastes have been treated, stored, or disposed of are subject to RCRA and may receive corrective action orders for instances of non-compliance. Compliance with these regulations and receiving corrective action orders could adversely affect our results, financial condition and cash flows. RCRA is particularly important in the coal industry because it regulates CCR — byproducts of coal combustion. In April 2015, EPA published CCR regulations under RCRA for the disposal of CCR from electric utilities and independent power producers. Importantly, CCR are regulated under RCRA as “non-hazardous” waste and avoid the stricter, more costly, regulations under RCRA’s “hazardous” waste rules. Notably, the CCR rule does not apply to CCRs placed in active or abandoned underground or surface mines. In 2018, EPA proposed two types of alternative performance standards related to CCR disposal. As proposed, these alternative standards appear to be less stringent than the current CCR rule. However, these alternatives have not been finalized.
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (“SMCRA”) establishes minimum environmental standards for operational mines as well as reclamation standards for reclaiming post-operational, mined land. The U.S. Office of Surface Mining (“OSM”) is responsible for issuing permits applying these standards to individual mining operations. However, states that operate federally approved state programs may impose standards which are more stringent than the requirements of SMCRA and OSM’s regulations and in many instances have done so. The Pennsylvania Mining Complex is located in states which have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of SMCRA through approved state programs. In addition, SMCRA imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The current per ton fee is $0.12 per ton for underground mined coal. This fee is currently scheduled to be in effect until September 30, 2021.
Federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. These bonds are provided by CONSOL Energy and are typically renewable on a yearly basis. Surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable. It is possible that surety bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral therefor. Any failure by CONSOL Energy or us to maintain, or our inability to acquire, surety bonds that are required by state and federal laws or the related collateral required by the bond issuers therefor, would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.
 Endangered Species Act (“ESA”). The federal ESA and other related federal and state statutes protect species that have been classified as endangered or threatened with possible extinction. Protection of these species could prohibit or delay authorization of mining activities, or may place additional restrictions on our operations related to timbering, construction or vegetation. A number of species indigenous to our operating areas are protected under the ESA; however, we do not believe the ESA would materially or adversely affect our mining operations under current approved mining plans. If more stringent or protective measures were required, or if additional critical habitat areas were designated, our operations could be exposed to additional requirements and expense, or delayed approval timeframes.

 Other Environmental Regulations. We are required to comply with other state, federal and local environmental laws in addition to those discussed above. These laws include, for example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Toxic Release Inventory, and the rules governing the use and storage of explosives regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and the Department of Homeland Security.
Health and Safety Laws
Mine Safety. Legislative and regulatory changes have required us to purchase additional safety equipment, construct stronger seals to isolate mined out areas, and engage in additional training. We have also experienced more aggressive inspection protocols, and with new regulations the volume of civil penalties have increased. The actions taken thus far by federal and state governments include requiring:

• | the caching of additional supplies of self-contained self-rescuer (“SCSR”) devices underground;


• | the purchase and installation of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground;


• | the purchase and installation of proximity detection devices on continuous miner machines;


• | the placement of refuge chambers, which are structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners during a mine emergency when evacuation from the mine is not possible, which will provide breathable air for 96 hours;


• | the purchase of new fire resistant conveyor belting underground;


• | additional training and testing that creates the need to hire additional employees;


• | more stringent rock dusting requirements; and


• | the purchase of personal dust monitors for collecting respirable dust samples from certain miners.

On September 2, 2015, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) published proposed rules for underground coal mining operations concerning proximity detection systems for coal hauling machines and scoops. The rulemaking record for this proposed rule was closed on December 15, 2016, but on January 9, 2017, MSHA published a notice reopening the record and extending the comment period for this proposed rule for 30 days. MSHA has not issued a final rule regarding these proposed rules.
On January 15, 2015, MSHA published a final rule requiring underground coal mine operations to equip continuous mining machines, except full-face continuous mining machines, with proximity detection systems. The proximity detection system strengthens protection for miners by reducing the potential of pinning, crushing and striking hazards that result in accidents involving life-threatening injuries and death. The final rule became effective March 15, 2015 and included a phased in schedule for newly manufactured and in-service equipment. 
In 2010, MSHA rolled out the “End Black Lung, Act Now” initiative. As a result, MSHA implemented a new final rule on August 1, 2014 to lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust including using the new Personal Dust Monitor technology. This final rule was implemented in three phases. The first phase began on August 1, 2014 and utilized the current gravimetric sampling device to take full shift dust samples from the current designated occupations and areas. It also required additional record keeping and immediate corrective action in the event of overexposure. The second phase began on February 1, 2016 and required additional sampling for designated and other occupations using the new continuous personal dust monitor (“CPDM”) technology, which provides real time dust exposure information to the miner. CPDM equipment was purchased and was placed into service which was required to meet compliance with the new rule. Dust Coordinators and Dust Technicians were hired in order to meet the staffing demand to manage compliance with the new rule. The final phase of the rule went into effect on August 1, 2016. The current respirable dust standard was reduced from 2.0 to 1.5mg/m3 for designated occupations and from 1.0 to 0.5mg/m3 for Part 90 Miners (coal miners who show evidence of the development of black lung disease).
Black Lung Legislation. Under federal black lung benefits legislation, each coal mine operator is required to make payments of black lung benefits or contributions to: 

• | current and former coal miners totally disabled from black lung disease;


• | certain survivors of miners who have died from black lung disease; and


• | a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants whose last mine employment was before January 1, 1970, where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims (where a miner’s last coal employment was after December 31, 1969), or where the responsible coal mine operator has defaulted on the payment of such benefits. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on U.S. production of coal, at a rate in 2018 of up to $1.10 per ton for deep mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price. On January 1, 2019 the excise tax levels reverted back to $0.50 per ton for deep mined coal and $0.25 per ton for surface-mined coal, capped at 2% of the coal's selling price.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) made two changes to the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. First, it provided changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims by creating a legal presumption that miners are entitled to benefits if they have worked at least 15 years in underground coal mines, or in similar conditions, and suffer from a totally disabling lung disease. To rebut this presumption, a coal company would have to prove that a miner did not have black lung or that the disease was not caused by the miner’s work. Second, it changed the law so that black lung benefits will continue to be paid to dependent survivors when the miner passes away, regardless of the cause of the miner’s death. The changes have increased the cost to us of complying with the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. In addition to the federal legislation, we are also liable under various state statutes for our portion of black lung claims.
Other State and Local Laws
  Ownership of Coal Rights. The Partnership’s coal business acquires ownership or leasehold rights to coal properties prior to conducting operations on those properties. As is customary in the coal industry, we have generally conducted only a summary review of the title to coal rights that are not in our development plans, but which we believe we control. This summary review is conducted at the time of acquisition or as part of a review of our land records to determine control of coal rights. Given our experience as a coal producer, we believe we have a well-developed ownership position relating to our coal control. Prior to the commencement of development operations on coal properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. We generally will not commence operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We are typically responsible for the cost of curing any title defects. We have completed title work on substantially all of our coal producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry.
Permits
 Environmental Proceedings. During the summer of 2014, certain environmental groups instituted litigation before the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board (“EHB”) challenging certain longwall mining permitting at the Bailey Mine. Following a hearing in August 2016, in August 2017, the EHB issued a decision rejecting the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s (“DEP”) requirement that CPCC install a synthetic stream-channel liner system in a stream overlying a portion of the Bailey Mine. On September 4, 2017, the DEP provided notice that it required additional time to review the technical merits of a permit application for continued longwall mining within the 4L panel under Polen Run at the Bailey Mine. As a result, the longwall was idled at that time and workforce adjustments were made, pending further developments with the DEP and permit submission. This was the first time in the 35-year history of the Bailey Mine that a needed mining permit had not been received in a timely fashion.
 The longwall was moved and resumed operations the first week of October 2017. Our management implemented several measures to mitigate the production impact from this delay, including working additional unscheduled shifts as compared to the previous five and a half day schedule. Our management continued to take steps to mitigate the production impact from this delay and worked closely with the necessary agencies to obtain operating permits to allow for continuity of longwall mining operations. In November 2017, the DEP issued permitting authorizing revised longwall mining plans in the 5L Panel and longwall mining in Panels 6L through 8L.
On March 21, 2018, Center for Coalfield Justice and Sierra Club (“Appellant's”) appealed the Partnership's application for continued longwall mining under Polen Run stream in the Bailey Mine 5L Panel. On November 28, 2018, the Appellants withdrew their notice of appeal and the EHB marked the docket closed and discontinued. The Bailey East (L longwall panel area) is no longer in litigation.
 The Pennsylvania Mining Complex operates five total longwalls, with many of the approved permits as far out as ten years in advance.
Employees
Neither we nor our subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for procuring the employees and other personnel necessary to conduct our operations. The directors and executive officers of our general partner manage our and our subsidiaries’ operations and activities. The executive officers of our general partner are employed and compensated by CONSOL Energy or its affiliates, other than the general partner. Under our omnibus agreement, we reimburse CONSOL Energy for compensation-related expenses (including salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts) attributable to the portion of an executive’s compensation that is allocable to our general partner. Pursuant to the operating agreement, CONSOL Thermal Holdings, our wholly owned subsidiary, manages and controls the day-to-day operations of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. Under our employee services agreement, employees of CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries

continue to mine, process and market coal from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, subject to our direction and control under the operating agreement. All of the field-level employees required to conduct and support our operations are employed by CONSOL Energy or its subsidiaries and are subject to the employee services agreement. As of December 31, 2018, CONSOL Energy employed approximately 1,572 people who provide direct support to our operations pursuant to the employee services agreement. None of the employees who provide direct support to the Pennsylvania Mining Complex are represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement. 
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”), for as long as the Partnership remains an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from the SEC’s reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking unitholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.
The Partnership will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2020, although we will lose that status sooner if:

• | we have more than $1.07 billion of revenues in a fiscal year;


• | limited partner interests held by non-affiliates have a market value of more than $700 million (large accelerated filer); or


• | we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.

The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Partnership has irrevocably elected to “opt out” of this exemption and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
Additionally, under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, the Partnership also qualifies as a “smaller reporting company” because its public float as of the last business day of the Partnership’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter was less than $250 million. For as long as the Partnership remains a “smaller reporting company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from the SEC’s reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies that are not smaller reporting companies.
