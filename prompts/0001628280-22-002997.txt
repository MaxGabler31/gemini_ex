Item 1. | BUSINESS

General
Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, doing business as Wabtec Corporation, is a Delaware corporation with headquarters at 30 Isabella Street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Our telephone number is 412-825-1000, and our website is located at www.wabteccorp.com. Except as the context otherwise requires, all references to “we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company” and “Wabtec” refer to Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. George Westinghouse founded the original Westinghouse Air Brake Co. in 1869 when he invented the air brake. Westinghouse Air Brake Company (“WABCO”) was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from American Standard, Inc., now known as Trane (“Trane”). The Company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1995. 
Throughout the years, the Company has made a number of strategic acquisitions leading the Company to where it is today. These have primarily included:
•the 1999 merger with MotivePower Industries, Inc. whereby the Company adopted its current name of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, or Wabtec; 
•the 2017 acquisition of Faiveley Transport, S.A. (“Faiveley Transport”), a leading provider of value-added, integrated systems and services, primarily for the global transit rail market. Based in France, the Faiveley Transport business has roots to 1919 and made Wabtec a leader in manufacturing pantographs, automatic door mechanisms, air conditioning systems, railway braking systems and couplers; and
•the 2019 acquisition of GE Transportation, a business unit of General Electric Company. This brought a global technology leader and supplier of locomotives, equipment, services and digital solutions to the rail, mining, marine, stationary power and drilling industries into Wabtec.
As a result of those strategic acquisitions, as well as other smaller acquisitions and organic growth, Wabtec is now one of the world’s largest providers of locomotives, value-added, technology-based equipment, systems and services for the global freight rail and passenger transit industries with approximately 25,000 employees, excluding contingent workers, and operations in over 50 countries. We believe we hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally. Our highly engineered products, which are intended to enhance safety, improve productivity, and reduce maintenance costs for customers, can be found on most locomotives, freight cars, passenger transit cars and buses around the world.
Through both internal growth as well as acquisitions, Wabtec has positioned itself with the following strategic benefits:
•Increased diversity of revenues by product, geography and market. Comprehensive product offerings spanning the freight rail and passenger transit industries, as well as products in the bus, mining and marine, and discrete industrial markets help Wabtec to balance the cyclical nature of the global rail business. 
•Significant operating synergies and improved financial profile. The consummation of the GE Transportation acquisition is leading to operating synergies across all of Wabtec. As a result, we achieved over $250 million in annual run-rate operating synergies, driven by cost and revenue opportunities. This will enhance Wabtec’s margins and revenue growth opportunities with strong free cash flow generation to enable strategic deleveraging through debt reduction and earnings growth.
•Increased technical and engineering expertise. Particularly with the onboarding of Faiveley Transport and GE Transportation, Wabtec's technical capabilities and product development efforts are strengthened.

Industry Overview
The Company primarily serves the global freight rail and passenger transit industries. As such, our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity, financial condition and capital spending plans of freight railroads and passenger transit agencies around the world, and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets. Many factors influence these industries, including general economic conditions; traffic volumes, as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership; government spending on public transportation; and investment in new technologies. In general, trends such as increasing urbanization and growth in developing markets, a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness, increasing investment in technology solutions, an aging equipment fleet, and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in freight rail and passenger transit.
The Association of the European Rail Industry, UNIFE, advocates for and represents European train builders and rail suppliers. UNIFE publishes a biennial market study that provides an overview of the market in its current form and a forecast of its future development in different regions and market segments. According to the 2020 biennial edition of the study, the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than $120 billion and is expected to grow in the medium- and long-term at an average annual growth rate of 2.3% through 2025, despite an 8% COVID-induced decline in 2020. The 2020 study also concluded that the rail sector had grown 3.6% annually since 2017, supporting the appeal of rail transport for all sectors from urban metro to commercial freight. The three largest geographic markets, which represented about 85% of the total accessible market, were Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, all of which are projected to continue to grow. 
In Europe, only 19% of freight traffic is rail while the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market, which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental policies encourage continued investment in public mass transit, and modal shift from car to rail, although this growth may be stunted in the near-term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In North America, railroads carry about 40% of intercity freight, as measured by ton-miles, which is more than any other mode of transportation. North America’s rail network is regarded as the world’s most-efficient and lowest-cost freight rail service. There are more than 600 railroads operating in North America, with the largest railroads, referred to as “Class I”, accounting for more than 90% of the industry’s revenues. Growth in the Asia Pacific market has been driven mainly by the continued urbanization of China and India, and by continued investments in freight rail rolling stock and infrastructure in Australia to serve its mining and natural resources markets. India is making significant investments in rolling stock and infrastructure to modernize its rail system
According to UNIFE, most emerging markets, including Russia-CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) and Africa-Middle East, are expected to grow at above-average rates as global trade leads to increased freight volumes and urbanization leads to increased demand for efficient mass-transportation systems. With about 1.3 million freight cars and about 21,000 locomotives, Russia-CIS is among the largest freight rail markets in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the expected growth in these emerging markets. 
As growth occurs, Wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets. New technologies offered by Wabtec can provide solutions to improve safety, cost and reliability of rail, as well as support the modernization of the global rail fleets. In its study, UNIFE also said it expected increased investment in digitalization, automation, and predictive maintenance through artificial intelligence, all of which would improve efficiency in the global rail industry.

We are using Lean principles to help examine processes and continuously improve them by solving problems at their root cause. Our Lean transformation model focuses on driving process improvements and management systems to maximize the flow of value produced for the customer, remove waste, empower employees and optimize the enterprise. These principles are also rigorously applied to sustainability and safety.
Recent Acquisitions and Joint Ventures
See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 5 of this report for additional information about our recent acquisitions and joint ventures.
Backlog
The Company’s backlog was approximately $22 billion at December 31, 2021. For 2021, approximately 60% of total net sales came from aftermarket orders, which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days and are not included in backlog for a significant period of time.
The Company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions, including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages. Generally, if a customer were to cancel a contract we would have an enforceable right to payment for work completed up to the date of cancellation which would include a reasonable profit margin. Substantial scope-of-work adjustments are common. For these and other reasons, completion of the Company’s backlog may be delayed or canceled. The railroad industry, in general, has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation.
The rollforward of the Company's backlog of firm customer orders and the expected year of completion are as follows:
In millions | Freight Segment | | Transit Segment | | Consolidated
Balance at December 31, 2020 | $ | 17,887 | | | $ | 3,704 | | $ | 21,591
New orders | 5,964 | | | 2,763 | | | 8,727 
Less: Net sales | (5,239) | | | (2,583) | | | (7,822)
Adjustments / foreign exchange | (110) | | | (217) | | | (327) 
Balance at December 31, 2021 | $ | 18,502 | | | $ | 3,667 | | $ | 22,169
Expected Delivery | | | | | 
2022 | $ | 4,520 | | | $ | 1,748 | | $ | 6,268 
Other years | $ | 13,982 | | | $ | 1,919 | | $ | 15,901

The Company saw no significant cancellations of backlog during the year ended December 31, 2021 despite the unprecedented pandemic caused by COVID-19 and its effects on locomotive parkings, carbuilds, and transit ridership levels. However, the economic slowdown and disruptions that were caused by COVID-19 did impact the timing of some orders in backlog as in certain cases the delivery of goods and services previously expected to be completed in the current year has been pushed out to future years.
Engineering and Development
To execute our strategy to develop new products, we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we invested $176 million, $162 million and $210 million, respectively, on product development and improvement activities. Significant incremental engineering expense is incurred with the execution of original equipment customer contracts. Across the corporation we have established multiple Centers of Competence, which have specialized, technical expertise in various disciplines and product areas.

For example, we have developed advanced cooling systems that enable lower emissions from diesel engines used in rail and other industrial markets.  Sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities, customers and other industry suppliers.
We use our Product Development System to develop and monitor new product programs. The system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process, from concept to launch, to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets.
Intellectual Property
We have approximately 6,000 active patents worldwide and on average file for approximately 300 new patents each year. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property. We also follow the product development practices of our competitors to monitor any possible patent infringement by them, and to evaluate their strategies and plans. 
Certain trademarks, among them the name WABCO®, were acquired or licensed from American Standard Inc., now known as Trane, in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the North American operations of the Railway Products Group of Trane. Other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program.
We have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee. We do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole.
Customers
We provide products and services for more than 500 customers worldwide. Our customers include passenger transit authorities and railroads throughout North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Africa and South America; manufacturers of transportation equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, passenger transit vehicles and buses; and companies that own, lease, and maintain such equipment.
Top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, our top five customers accounted for approximately 28% of net sales. No one customer represents 10% or more of consolidated net sales. We believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers.
Competition
We hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally, although market shares vary by product lines and geographies. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very cost-conscious. In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery, and customer service and support.
Our principal competitors vary across product lines and geographies. Within North America, New York Air Brake Company, a subsidiary of the German air brake producer Knorr-Bremse AG (“Knorr”) and Amsted Rail Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Amsted Industries Corporation, are our principal overall OEM competitors. Our competition for locomotive, freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ in-house operations, Electro-Motive Diesel, a division of Caterpillar, and Knorr. We believe our key strengths, which include leading market positions in core products, including sustainable technologies, breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business, leading design and engineering capabilities, significant barriers to entry, strategic partnerships and operational excellence, coupled with an experienced management team, enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace. Outside of North America, Knorr is our main competitor, although not in every product line or geography. In addition, our competitors often include smaller, local suppliers in most international markets. Depending on the product line and geography, we can also compete with our customers, such as CRRC Corporation Limited, a China-based manufacturer of rolling stock.

During 2021, Wabtec adopted its Green Finance Framework. Following the release of the Green Financing Framework, the Company issued its inaugural "green bond" – a €500 million issuance in the European bond market. The Company intends to utilize green financing instruments as part of its overall capital resources strategy to support the transition to a low-carbon transportation future and meet the sustainable transportation needs of growing cities around the world. Projects supported by green financing will largely target the objective of climate change mitigation by focusing on the efficiency of freight rail systems and public transport, as well as on the provision of energy-efficient customer solution services. Focus areas include: 
• Clean transportation
• Eco-efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes
• Renewable energy
• Pollution prevention and control
• Energy efficiency 
Cybersecurity Framework 
Cybersecurity and data protection are important considerations in the design and production of Wabtec products, projects, and services. Information technology is used and relied upon extensively by our business. We collect, process, and retain sensitive and confidential customer information, including proprietary business information, personal data and other information, some of which may be subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed data protection controls. To address risks related to cybersecurity and privacy, Wabtec seeks to leverage industry cybersecurity practices that have been developed by organizations such as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Standardization Organization (ISO) and also engages external independent advisors. Wabtec’s Data Protection Plan describes the technical, physical and administrative controls used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information provided to and managed by Wabtec. Cybersecurity is addressed and discussed regularly with our Chief Information Officer, the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. Wabtec also maintains SOC 1 Type 2 certification for select digital products, as well as cyber liability insurance coverage. We also regularly evaluate our response readiness, including disaster recovery plans and business continuity considerations in the case of a cyber incident. Finally, Wabtec engages in regular security awareness training to highlight and educate its employees on how to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks at the individual level.
ESG Goals
Wabtec is committed to transparency on ESG topics, including the opportunities and challenges we encounter as we work to enhance performance and conduct business in a responsible manner. In 2020, we established ESG goals around innovation, operations, safety, and people. We report our progress on these goals annually in our published Sustainability Report, which can be found on our website at www.wabteccorp.com/sustainability. The content referred to on any website referred to in this annual report, including the Sustainability Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
Wabtec developed an ESG governance framework to provide oversight for our climate action strategy. This structure starts with Wabtec's Board of Directors and its committees who oversee the execution of the Company’s ESG strategy as part of their oversight of Wabtec’s overall business. In particular, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of Wabtec’s sustainability strategy and execution against key goals, as well as the review of climate-related risks and opportunities. To further facilitate the Board’s engagement and oversight, climate was added as a risk category in Wabtec’s enterprise risk management process.
Employees
Human Capital
At Wabtec, we believe performance drives progress, and are committed to developing sustainable transportation solutions that move and improve the world. We are committed to driving an inclusive culture and integrating our talent and capabilities across the enterprise. As a company, we believe that protecting the health and safety of our people and the environment is the responsibility of everyone at Wabtec, especially during a global pandemic. 
Our headquarters are in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and we have offices and facilities in over 50 countries around the globe. As of December 31, 2021, we have a global workforce of approximately 25,000 employees, excluding contingent workers. 
Diversity and Inclusion
Wabtec is committed to ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace that respects and seeks the unique talents, experiences and viewpoints of all our employees. Wabtec has a Diversity and Inclusion Council, led by members of Wabtec’s executive leadership team, who oversee global diversity and inclusion policies and initiatives. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where employees can be themselves. Our Board of Directors also plays a critical role in creating an organization that prioritizes, supports, and invests in diversity, inclusion, and equity. Over the last two years, Wabtec has named three diverse
members to its Board. Currently, 40% of Wabtec’s Board is diverse (gender; race/ethnicity), and over 18% of Wabtec’s global senior management are female and roughly 18% are people of color based in the U.S. In 2020, women constituted approximately 16% of our global workforce and approximately 18% of our salaried employees and people of color constituted approximately 20% of our U.S. salaried workforce and approximately 24% of the total U.S. workforce. 
Training and Development
We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring and coaching programs. We have invested in training courses through Wabtec’s Learning Management System (LMS). In 2021, Wabtec partnered with a third-party to provide diversity and inclusion training. Over 4,000 employees participated in the training, which was coupled with tools and resources for people leaders to help make diversity and inclusion part of a long-term conversation rather than a one-time training. 
Our two-year Leadership, Expertise, Advancement and Development (LEAD) program is the primary path for university graduates into Wabtec. LEAD is a two-year program that offers an immersive learning experience in the fields of engineering, operations, finance and IT along with extensive leadership training designed to build the next generation of leaders. On average, there are 100 participants in the LEAD program that rotate between business units every six months to work on strategic projects and assignments, gain exposure to senior leadership and build their global professional network. We are focused on strengthening this program to support our global talent pipeline.
Health and Safety 
When it comes to employee safety, our commitment is to provide safe work environments for our employees and to meet or exceed environmental, health, and safety (EHS) laws and regulations in the places where we operate. In 2020, the Company relaunched the Environment, Health, and Safety component of the Wabtec Management System (known as the “EHS WMS”) to strengthen our management system approach to addressing EHS risks and promote the consistent implementation of best practices across all our global manufacturing and services sites, regardless of how local laws are implemented or enforced. The EHS WMS establishes standard expectations in 13 core competency areas, including leadership and accountability, regulatory applicability review, EHS processes and systems, risk assessment, safety defenses, exposure defenses, environmental defenses 
and contractor management. Operational sites are measured against these EHS program expectations. In addition, the Company’s EHS WMS is directly aligned to accepted international standards, such as ISO 14001 for Environmental and ISO 45001 for Occupational Health and Safety. With zero fatalities and over 80 operational sites with zero recordable injuries, 2020 marked the 13th consecutive year of injury rate reductions across Wabtec's vast operations. 
In 2021, Wabtec continued its commitment to safety and launched a four week EHS leadership training course aimed at building the toolkits of front-line supervisors and plant managers. The course was designed to establish a common understanding of Wabtec’s EHS tools and terminology, initiate a partnership between the plant manager and their EHS leader on a personal action plan, connect plant managers to the broader network of global leaders, and encourage decision making at the site level that is informed by an understanding of EHS impacts and of legal and compliance responsibilities. In 2021, over 120 leaders from 26 countries attended the training.
COVID-19 
The pandemic has reinforced the importance of keeping Wabtec employees safe and healthy while keeping essential rail services and the global economy moving. When the pandemic began, Wabtec launched its COVID-19 Crisis Management Team, which met daily to focus on three key elements: protecting our people, serving our customers, and ensuring business continuity. Manufacturing and office locations were required to implement risk assessment methodologies and rethink work practices to allow for remote working or social distancing, develop new procedures for workplace entry, strengthen site-level crisis management teams and implement new tools for rapid communication with site employees. Site leaders and people managers were trained on techniques for communicating transparently and navigating complex business decisions during a crisis. 
Compensation and Benefits
We remain committed to a strong pay-for performance philosophy that aligns individual performance, behaviors and business results with individual rewards. To deliver on that commitment, we utilize market data to benchmark to the external market, and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of the job and performance when determining compensation. 
We provide our employees resources to help them succeed. We offer a wide range of benefits including healthcare and wellness benefits, retirement benefits, an Employee Assistance Program, Employee Resource Groups to build diverse communities at Wabtec, and paid time off.
Regulation
In the course of our operations, we are subject to various regulations and standards of governments and other agencies in the U.S. and around the world. These entities typically govern equipment, safety and interoperability standards for freight rail rolling stock and passenger transit, oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers.  New products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy. As a result of these regulations and requirements, we must usually obtain and maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries.  The governing bodies include the FRA and the Association of American Railroads ("AAR") in the U.S., and the International Union of Railways (“UIC”) and the European Railway Agencies in Europe. Also, in Europe, the European Committees for Standardization continually draft new European standards which cover, for example, the Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety of railways systems. To guarantee interoperability in Europe, the European Union for Railway Agencies is responsible for defining and implementing Technical Standards of Interoperability, which covers areas such as infrastructure, energy, rolling stock, telematic applications, traffic operation and management subsystems, noise pollution and waste generation, protection against fire and smoke, and system safety.
Most countries and regions in which Wabtec does business have similar rule-making bodies. For example, in Russia, a GOST-R certificate of conformity is mandatory for all products related to the safety of individuals in Russian territory. In China, any product or system sold on the Chinese market must have been certified in accordance with national standards. In the local Indian market, most products are covered by regulations patterned after AAR and UIC standards.
Effects of Seasonality
Our business has limited seasonality. Third quarter results may be affected by the timing of services performed under our locomotive maintenance contracts and vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers. Fourth quarter results may be affected by the timing of spare parts and service orders placed by transit agencies worldwide. Quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of projects in backlog and by project delays.
Environmental Matters
The Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with 
releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes its operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.
