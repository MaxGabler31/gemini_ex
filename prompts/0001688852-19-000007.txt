Business
We are a publicly-traded company that originates and acquires ground leases in order to generate attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns from our investments. We believe that our business has characteristics comparable to a high-grade, fixed income investment business, but with certain unique advantages. Relative to alternative fixed income investments generally, our ground leases typically benefit from built-in growth derived from contractual rent increases, and the opportunity to realize value from future rights to acquire the buildings and other improvements on our land at no additional cost to us. We believe that these features offer us the opportunity to realize superior risk-adjusted total returns when compared to certain alternative highly-rated investments.
Ground leases generally represent the ownership of land underlying commercial real estate properties, which are leased on a long term basis (often 30 to 99 years) by the land owner (landlord) to a tenant that owns and operates the building on top of the land ("Ground Lease"), which we refer to as a SafeholdTM. The property is generally leased on a triple net basis with the tenant generally responsible for taxes, maintenance and insurance as well as all operating costs and capital expenditures. Ground Leases typically provide that at the end of the lease term or upon tenant default and the termination of the Ground Lease upon such default, the land, building and all improvements revert to the landlord. We seek to become the industry leader in Ground Leases by demonstrating the value of the product to real estate investors, owners, operators and developers and expanding their use throughout major metropolitan areas.
We have a diverse portfolio of 28 properties located in major metropolitan areas. All of the properties in our portfolio are subject to long-term leases consisting of 23 Ground Leases and one master lease (covering five properties) that provide for contractual periodic rent escalations or percentage rent participations in gross revenues generated at the relevant properties.
We have chosen to focus on Ground Leases because we believe they meet an important need in the real estate capital markets for our customers. We also believe Ground Leases offer a unique combination of safety, income growth and the potential for capital appreciation for investors for the following reasons:
High Quality Long-Term Cash Flow: We believe that a Ground Lease represents a safe position in a property's capital structure. This safety is derived from the typical structure of a Ground Lease, which we believe creates a low likelihood of a tenant default and a low likelihood of a loss by the Ground Lease landlord in the event of a tenant default. A Ground Lease landlord typically has the right to regain possession of its land and take ownership of the buildings and improvements thereon upon a tenant default, which provides a strong incentive for a Ground Lease tenant to make the required Ground Lease rent payments. Furthermore, most lessees finance their leasehold improvements. We believe such leasehold loans provide an additional form of credit support to our investment cash flows because we believe that it is reasonably likely that a leasehold lender would seek to cure a tenant default in order to protect its collateral. Additionally, the combined property value subject to a Ground Lease typically significantly exceeds the amount of the Ground Lease landlord's investment at the time it was made; therefore, even if the Ground Lease landlord 
1

takes over the property following a tenant default or upon expiration of the Ground Lease, the landlord is reasonably likely to recover substantially all of its Ground Lease investment, and possibly amounts in excess of its investment, depending upon prevailing market conditions.
Income Growth: Ground Leases typically provide growing income streams through contractual base rent escalators that may compound over the duration of the lease. These rent escalators may be based on fixed increases, a Consumer Price Index ("CPI") or a combination thereof, and may also include a participation in the gross revenues of the underlying property. We believe that this growth in the lease rate over time can mitigate the effects of inflation and capture for anticipated increases in land values over time, as well as serving as a basis for growing our dividend. 
Opportunity for Capital Appreciation: The opportunity for capital appreciation with Ground Leases comes in two forms. First, as the ground rent grows over time, the value of the Ground Lease should grow under market conditions in which capitalization rates remain flat. Second, at the expiration or earlier termination of our Ground Leases, we typically have the right to regain possession of the land underlying the Ground Lease and take title to the buildings and other improvements thereon for no additional consideration. This reversion right creates additional potential value to our stockholders.
We generally target Ground Lease investments in which the initial cost of the Ground Lease represents 30% to 45% of the combined value of the land and buildings and improvements thereon ("Combined Property Value") as if there were no Ground Lease on the land. If the initial cost of a Ground Lease is equal to 35% of the Combined Property Value, the remaining 65% of the Combined Property Value represents potential value accretion to us upon the reversion of the property, assuming no intervening change in the Combined Property Value. We refer to this potential value accretion as the "Value Bank," defined as the difference between the initial cost of the Ground Lease and the Combined Property Value. In our view, there is a strong correlation between inflation and commercial real estate values over time, which supports our belief that the value of our Value Bank should increase over time as inflation increases. Our ability to recognize value through reversion rights may be limited by the rights of our tenants under some of our Ground Leases, including tenant rights to purchase our land in certain circumstances and the right of one tenant to demolish improvements prior to the expiration of the lease. See "Risk Factors" for a discussion of these tenant rights.
We believe that the reversion right is a unique feature distinguishing Ground Leases from other fixed income investments and property types; however, no amounts relating to Value Bank are recorded on our balance sheet or reflected in our earnings. Accordingly, we periodically estimate and report the value of our Value Bank based in part on valuations of the Combined Property Value under our Ground Leases. We retain an independent valuation firm to prepare: (a) initial reports of the Combined Property Value associated with each Ground Lease in our portfolio; and (b) periodic updates of such reports. As reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 14, 2019, as of December 31, 2018, our estimated Value Bank is $1,809 million. Please review that 8-K for a discussion of the valuation methodology used and important limitations and qualifications of the calculation of Value Bank. See also "Risk Factors - There can be no assurance that we will realize any incremental value from the Value Bank or that the market price of our common stock will reflect any value attributable thereto."
Market Opportunity: We believe that there is a significant market opportunity for a dedicated provider of Ground Lease capital like us. We believe that the market for existing Ground Leases is fragmented with ownership comprised primarily of high net worth individuals, pension funds, life insurance companies, estates and endowments. However, while we intend to pursue acquisitions of existing Ground Leases, our investment thesis is predicated, in part, on what we believe is an untapped market opportunity to expand the use of Ground Leases to a broader component of the approximately $7.0 trillion institutional commercial property market in the U.S. We intend to capture this market opportunity by utilizing multiple sourcing and origination channels, including manufacturing new Ground Leases with third-party owners and developers of commercial real estate and originating Ground Leases to provide capital for development and redevelopment. We further believe that Ground Leases generally represent an attractive source of capital for our tenants and may allow them to generate superior returns on their invested equity as compared to utilizing alternative sources of capital. We draw on the extensive investment origination and sourcing platform of iStar, the parent company of our manager, to actively promote the benefits of the Ground Lease structure to prospective Ground Lease tenants.
Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SAFE." We were incorporated in Maryland on April 14, 2017. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with the tax year ended December 31, 2017. We conduct all of our business and own all of our properties through our subsidiary operating partnership, Safety Income and Growth Operating Partnership LP (the "Operating Partnership"), in what is commonly referred to as an "UPREIT" structure.

Investment Strategy
Our primary investment objective is to construct a diversified portfolio of Ground Leases that will generate attractive high-quality risk-adjusted returns and support stable and growing distributions to our stockholders. We have identified several channels for pursuing Ground Lease investment opportunities which include:

• | Create a Ground Lease with a Third Party. We seek to pursue opportunities where a third party acquiror or existing owner of a commercial property may be interested in utilizing a Ground Lease structure to facilitate its options with respect to its interests in the property. We will create the Ground Lease by splitting ownership of the property into an ownership interest and Ground Lease on the land, and a separate leasehold interest of the building and improvements thereon. We will acquire the ownership interest and Ground Lease on the land from the third party.


• | Acquire Existing Ground Leases. We seek to acquire existing Ground Leases that are marketed for sale and actively solicit potential sellers and related property brokers of existing Ground Leases to engage in off-market transactions. Our structure as an UPREIT gives us the ability to acquire Ground Leases from owners, particularly estates and high net worth individuals, using Operating Partnership units that may provide the seller with tax advantages, as well as liquidity, portfolio diversification and professional management.


• | Originate Ground Leases to Provide Capital For Development or Value-Add Redevelopment or Repositioning. We seek opportunities where we can purchase land and simultaneously lease it pursuant to a new Ground Lease to a tenant who plans to develop a new, or significantly improve an existing, commercial property on the land.


• | Acquire a Commercial Real Estate Property to Create a Ground Lease. We seek in select instances, in partnership with our Manager, to acquire commercial real estate properties that have the potential to be converted into an ownership structure that includes a Ground Lease retained by us and a leasehold interest that may be acquired by our Manager or sold to a third party.


• | Finance Third Party Ground Leases. Combining our capital resources with our Manager's relationships and Ground Lease expertise, we seek opportunities to originate Ground Lease investments in conjunction with our Manager's origination of a leasehold financing with the same customer.

We generally intend to target Ground Leases that meet some or all of the following investment criteria: 

• | Underlying properties located in major metropolitan areas;


• | Average remaining initial lease terms of 30 to 99 years;


• | Periodic contractual rent escalators or percentage rent participations;


• | Value of approximately 30% to 45% of the Combined Property Value at the commencement of the lease or the acquisition date;


• | Ground Rent Coverage, defined as the ratio of the Underlying Property's NOI to the annualized base rental payment due us, of approximately 2.0x to 5.0x for the initial 12-month period of the lease. Underlying Property NOI is defined as the trailing twelve month net operating income of the commercial real estate being operated at the property without giving effect to any rent paid or payable under our Ground Lease;


• | First year cash return on asset of between 3.0% and 4.5%;


• | Underlying properties that we believe are well located in markets with high barriers to entry and that have durable cash flow; and


• | Transaction sizes ranging from $20 to $250 million.

Recent iStar Investment Transaction
On January 2, 2019, iStar invested $250.0 million in our Operating Partnership by purchasing 12,500,000 newly designated limited partnership units, or the "Investor Units", from the Operating Partnership at a purchase price of $20.00 per unit. This transaction was approved by a special committee of our board of directors, with the advice of independent legal and financial advisors. We used proceeds from the sale of the Investor Units to repay the 2017 Revolver and intend to use the remaining proceeds to fund future investments in Ground Leases. 
Investor Units. Each Investor Unit will receive distributions equivalent to distributions declared and paid on one share of our common stock. The Investor Units have no voting rights. They have limited protective consent rights over certain matters such as amendments to the terms of the Investor Units that would adversely affect the Investor Units.
3

The Investor Units may not be converted or exchanged for cash or other property; provided, however, that we have agreed to seek stockholder approval to exchange the Investor Units for shares of our common stock, on a one-for-one basis. The Investor Units may not be transferred prior to such exchange. They will be transferable, subject to compliance with securities laws, if stockholder approval for the exchange has not been obtained by June 30, 2019. Prior to the stockholder meeting held to obtain approval for the exchange, we will be restricted from issuing our common stock or partnership units of the Operating Partnership at less than $20.00 per share or unit other than grants pursuant to our equity incentive plan; provided, however, that we may issue up to $100.0 million of shares of our common stock at a price less than $20.00 in an offering in which iStar is offered the opportunity to purchase shares to maintain its percentage ownership interest in us.
The Investor Units represent an approximately 40.6% fully diluted economic interest in us. After giving effect to the issuance of the Investor Units, iStar's aggregate fully diluted economic interest in us (including the shares of our common stock and Investor Units owned by iStar) is approximately 65.5%; however, iStar's voting power, both before and after giving effect to each of the purchase of the Investor Units and their exchange for our common stock, and will be limited to 41.9%, as a result of limitations on iStar's voting power contained in the Stockholder's Agreement described below.
Stockholder's Agreement. In connection with iStar's purchase of the Investor Units, we entered into a Stockholder's Agreement with iStar on January 2, 2019, which sets forth certain rights and obligations of the parties relating to iStar's ownership of the Investor Units and our common stock.
The Stockholder's Agreement provides that with respect to any matter presented for a vote or written consent of the holders of our common stock after the date on which the Investor Units are exchanged for shares of our common stock or the "Exchange Date", iStar will vote all "Excess Shares" in the same proportions as the votes cast or consents delivered by holders of our common stock other than iStar. "Excess Shares" means the number of shares of our common stock, including, without limitation, shares issued in exchange for Investor Units, or the "Exchange Shares", owned by iStar from time to time that exceed 41.9% of our outstanding common stock at such time, including the Exchange Shares. These voting limitations will remain in effect until the first date on which iStar's aggregate ownership percentage of our outstanding common stock is less than 41.9%.
The Stockholder's Agreement also provides that, notwithstanding the voting limitations described above, for three years, iStar will cast all of its voting power in favor of three individuals who are independent of each of iStar and us within the meaning of the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange to serve as directors on our board. iStar has also agreed to certain standstill provisions for a term of two years.
The Stockholder's Agreement restricts iStar's ability to transfer Exchange Shares for one year after the Exchange Date. In addition, for a period of two years, iStar will not transfer shares of our common stock representing more than 20% of our outstanding common stock in one transaction or a series of related transactions to any person or group, other than transfers pursuant to a widely distributed public offering, unless the non-iStar holders of our common stock are afforded the opportunity to participate in the transaction at the same price per security and in the same proportion as their shares of our common stock represent of our outstanding fully diluted equity.
The Stockholder's Agreement provides that iStar will have certain rights (but not the obligation) to maintain its percentage ownership interest of our common stock by purchasing additional shares of our common stock when we issue additional shares from time to time, subject to certain exceptions. Any shares purchased by iStar pursuant to such rights will be subject to the voting power limitations set forth in the agreement.
Amended and Restated Management Agreement. In connection with the transactions described above, SFTY Manager LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of iStar) and we amended and restated our Management Agreement, dated as of June 27, 2017, or the "Amended and Restated Management Agreement." The Amended and Restated Management Agreement, dated January 2, 2019, provides for a base management fee that will increase incrementally as our Total Equity (as defined in the agreement) increases (refer to Note 13). The management fee will be payable in cash or shares of our common stock, at our election (as determined by our independent directors). Our common stock issued to pay the management fee will be valued at the greater of $20.00 or a recent volume weighted average market price.
The Amended and Restated Management Agreement will have an initial term through June 30, 2022 during which the agreement is non-terminable, except for certain cause events. After the initial term, the agreement will be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless two-thirds of our independent directors decline to renew the agreement because they have determined that the manager's long-term performance is unsatisfactory to the point of material detriment to us. We will be obligated to pay the manager a termination fee equal to three times the annual management fee paid in respect of the last completed fiscal year prior to the termination if, by the time of such termination, we have raised Total Equity of at least $820.0 million since inception, including from iStar.
In addition, beginning with the seventh annual renewal term after the initial term and in connection with each annual renewal thereafter, we may decline to renew the management agreement if two-thirds of our independent directors determine that the 
4

management fee is unfair and the manager does not accept a different fee, or the parties are unable, after good faith negotiations, to agree on a new fee. The termination fee will be payable upon such termination provided that the total equity condition described above has been satisfied.
Additional Agreements. In connection with iStar's purchase of the Investor Units, we have entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement with iStar, dated January 2, 2019, which requires us to, among other things, use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission within six months after the purchase of the Investor Units a shelf registration statement providing for resale of all shares of our common stock held by iStar. The agreement also provides iStar with certain demand registration rights. The agreement amends and restates the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of June 27, 2017, between iStar and us.
We entered into voting agreements with each of SFTY Venture LLC and SFTY VII-B, LLC pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their shares of our common stock to approve the issuance of our common stock upon the exchange of Investor Units and the grant of the preemptive rights described above to iStar at the stockholder meeting called for such purpose. The voting agreements expire on June 30, 2019. SFTY VII-B, LLC is an affiliate of Lubert-Adler, L.P. Dean Adler, a principal of Lubert-Adler, L.P., is a director of SAFE REIT. SFTY Venture LLC owns 2,125,000 shares of our common stock and SFTY VII-B, LLC owns 750,000 shares of our common stock at the date of this Report.
Policies with Respect to Other Activities
Our investment, disposition, financing and corporate governance policies (including conflicts of interests policies) are managed under the ultimate supervision of our board of directors. We can amend, revise or eliminate these policies at any time without a vote of its shareholders. We intend to originate and manage investments in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") for us to qualify as a REIT.
Investment Policies 
Investment in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate 
We conduct substantially all of our investment activities through our Operating Partnership and its affiliates. Our primary investment objective is to enhance stockholder value by increasing cash flow from our operations.
We pursue our primary investment objective primarily through the ownership, directly or indirectly, by our Operating Partnership of our Ground Lease investments. Future investment activities will not be limited to any geographic area or to a specified percentage of our assets. While we may diversify in terms of property type, geography, tenant and lease term, we do not have any limit on the amount or percentage of our assets that may be invested in any one of the foregoing categories. We intend to engage in such future investment activities in a manner that is consistent with our qualification and maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We do not have a specific policy to acquire assets primarily for capital gain or primarily for income. In addition, we may purchase, lease and/or finance Ground Lease assets for long-term investment, or sell such assets, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. 
We may also participate with third parties in ventures or other types of co-ownership, if we determine that doing so would be the most effective means of raising capital. We will not, however, enter into a venture or other partnership arrangement to make an investment that would not otherwise meet our investment policies. We also may acquire real estate or interests in real estate in exchange for the issuance of common stock, Operating Partnership units, preferred stock or options to purchase stock. 
Investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or to new indebtedness which may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments, and we may in the future have corporate level indebtedness through credit facilities and debt securities. Principal of and interest on our debt will have a priority over any dividends and any liquidation amounts with respect to our common stock. Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. 
Investments in Real Estate Mortgages 
Our current portfolio consists primarily of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in real estate. We may also finance Ground Lease transactions in the future and invest in mortgages or deeds of trust. Debt investments run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under the debt and the collateral securing the debt may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup our full investment. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Portfolio and Our Business—Loans that we make to Ground Lease owners will be subject to delinquency, foreclosure and loss, which could result in losses to us." 
5

Investments in Securities of or Interests in Persons Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities and Other Issuers 
Subject to our qualification as a REIT, we may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. We do not currently have any policy limiting the types of entities in which we may invest or the proportion of assets to be so invested, whether through acquisition of an entity's common stock, limited liability or partnership interests, interests in another REIT or entry into a joint venture. We intend to invest primarily in entities that own real estate and provide Ground Lease capital. We have no current plans to make material investments in entities that are not engaged in real estate activities. Our business objectives are to enhance stockholder value by increasing cash flow from operations, acquire and originate target investments and provide cash distributions and long-term capital appreciation to our stockholders through increases in the value of our company. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of the foregoing objectives. 
Investment in Other Securities 
Other than as described above, we do not intend to invest in any additional securities such as loans, bonds, preferred stock or common stock. 
Disposition Policies 
We may from time to time dispose of investments if, based upon our Manager's and our board's periodic review of our portfolio, we determine such action would be in our best interest. In addition, we may elect to enter into joint ventures or other types of co-ownership with respect to properties that we own, either in connection with acquiring interests in other properties (as discussed above in "—Investment Policies—Investment in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate") or from investors to raise equity capital. 
Financing Policies 
We expect to utilize leverage. Our current strategy is to generally target overall leverage at an amount that is approximately 25% of the aggregate Combined Property Value of our portfolio, but not to exceed an overall ratio of 2:1 relative to our total equity. However, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. We anticipate that our Manager, under the supervision of our board of directors, will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or floating rate. Our board of directors may from time to time modify our leverage policies in light of the then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general market conditions for debt and equity issuances, fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors, including the restrictive covenants under our debt obligations. 
To the extent our board of directors determines to obtain additional capital, we may, without stockholder approval, borrow funds or issue debt or equity securities, including additional Operating Partnership units, retain earnings (subject to the distribution requirements applicable to REITs under the Code) or pursue a combination of these methods. As long as our Operating Partnership is in existence, the proceeds of all equity capital raised by us will be contributed to our Operating Partnership in exchange for additional interests in our Operating Partnership, which will dilute the ownership interests of the then existing limited partners in our Operating Partnership.
Hedging Strategy
We may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities. Hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements, options, futures contracts, forward rate agreements or similar financial instruments. We intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. 
Conflict of Interest Policies 
Conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future with iStar and its affiliates, including our Manager, our executive officers and/or directors who are also officers and/or directors of iStar, and any limited partner of our Operating Partnership. Conflicts may include, without limitation: conflicts arising from the enforcement of agreements between us and iStar or our Manager; conflicts in the amount of time that officers and employees of our Manager will spend on our affairs versus iStar's other affairs; conflicts in future transactions that we may pursue with iStar; and conflicts in pursuing transactions that could be structured as either a Ground Lease or as another type of transaction that is within iStar's investment focus. iStar is our largest shareholder and owned approximately 41.8% of our common stock at the date of this Report. On January 2, 2019, iStar purchased $250.0 million of Investor Units in our Operating Partnership, representing approximately 40.6% of the limited partner interests in our Operating Partnership and bringing iStar's aggregate economic interest in our Operating Partnership to approximately 65.5%. See "Recent iStar Investment Transaction" above for further details. In addition, two directors of iStar serve on our board of directors, 
6

including Jay Sugarman, who is the chief executive officer of iStar and our chief executive officer. Our Manager is a wholly-owned subsidiary of iStar. As a result of the foregoing relationships, iStar has significant influence over us. 
We have entered into an exclusivity agreement with iStar pursuant to which iStar (including iStar's Net Lease Venture II equity method investment) has agreed that it will not acquire, originate, invest in, or provide financing for a third party's acquisition of, a Ground Lease unless it has first offered that opportunity to us. The exclusivity agreement does not apply to opportunities that include only an incidental interest in Ground Leases or opportunities to manufacture or otherwise create a Ground Lease from a property that has been owned by iStar's first net lease venture (Net Lease Venture) for at least three years after the closing of our initial public offering. The existing net lease venture invests in single tenant properties leased to corporate entities under triple net leases. iStar owns a 51.9% interest in, and manages the day to day operations of, the net lease venture and several of its executives whose time is substantially devoted to the venture own a 0.6% equity interest in the venture and are entitled to participate in promote payments made to iStar. The exclusivity agreement will remain in effect during the term of the management agreement. The exclusivity agreement will automatically terminate upon any termination of the management agreement and will not otherwise be terminable. We do not generally expect to enter into ventures with iStar, but if we do so, the terms and conditions of our venture investment will be subject to the approval of a majority of disinterested directors of our board of directors.
Our directors and executive officers have duties to us under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our company. At the same time, we have fiduciary duties, as a general partner, to our Operating Partnership and to the limited partners under Delaware law (the jurisdiction of the Operating Partnership's organization) in connection with the management of our Operating Partnership. Our duties as a general partner to our Operating Partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and executive officers to our company. Unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of loyalty and care and which generally prohibits such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest. The limited partners of our Operating Partnership have agreed that in the event of such a conflict, we will fulfill our fiduciary duties to such limited partners by acting in the best interests of our company. 
Additionally, the Operating Partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither the general partner of the Operating Partnership, nor any of its directors or officers, will be liable or accountable in damages to our Operating Partnership, the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we, or such director or officer, acted in good faith. In addition, our Operating Partnership is required to indemnify us, our affiliates and each of our respective executive officers, directors and employees and any person we may designate from time to time in our sole and absolute discretion, including present and former members, managers, stockholders, directors, limited partners, general partners, officers or controlling persons of our predecessor, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Operating Partnership, provided that our Operating Partnership will not indemnify such person for: (i) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law; (ii) any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the Operating Partnership agreement; or (iii) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful. 
The provisions of Delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by an operating partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the Operating Partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the Operating Partnership agreement. 
Our charter and bylaws do not restrict any of our directors, executive officers, stockholders or affiliates from having a pecuniary interest in an investment or transaction that we have an interest in or from conducting, for their own account, business activities of the type we conduct. We have, however, adopted certain policies designed to eliminate or minimize certain potential conflicts of interest. Specifically, we adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that prohibits conflicts of interest between our executive officers, employees and directors on the one hand, and our company on the other hand, except in compliance with the policy. Our code of business conduct and ethics states that a conflict of interest exists when a person's private interest interferes with our interest. For example, a conflict of interest will arise when any of our employees, executive officers or directors or any immediate family member of such employee, executive officer or director receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position with us. Our code of business conduct and ethics also limits our employees, executive officers and directors from engaging in any activity that is competitive with the business activities and operations of our company, except as disclosed by us from time to time in our public filings. In addition, our code of business conduct and ethics also restricts the ability of our employees, executive officers and directors to participate in a joint venture, partnership or other business arrangement with us, except in compliance with the policy. Waivers of our code of business conduct and ethics will be required to be disclosed in accordance 
7

with New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requirements. In addition, we have adopted corporate governance guidelines to assist our board of directors in the exercise of its responsibilities and to serve our interests and those of our stockholders. However, we cannot assure you these policies or provisions of law will always succeed in eliminating the influence of such conflicts. If they are not successful, decisions could be made that might fail to reflect the best interest of all stockholders. 
Competition
We compete with numerous commercial developers, real estate companies (including other REITs), financial institutions (such as banks and insurance companies) and other investors (such as pension funds, investment funds, private companies and individuals) for investment opportunities and tenants. This competition may result in higher costs for properties, lower returns and impact our ability to grow. Some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources and access to more attractive capital than we do. However, due to our focus on Ground Leases located throughout the U.S., and because some of our competitors are locally and/or regionally focused, we do not always encounter the same competitors in each market. 
Regulation
General 
Our properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the necessary permits and approvals to conduct our business. 
Environmental Matters 
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, as an owner of real property, we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under the properties we own as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. These liabilities may include government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property. These laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence or disposal of those substances. This liability may be imposed on us in connection with the activities of an operator of, or tenant at, the property. The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages, and our liability therefor, could be significant and could exceed the value of the property and/have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, the presence of those substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remove those substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using such property as collateral, which, in turn, would reduce our revenues and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders. 
A property can also be adversely affected either through physical contamination or by virtue of an adverse effect upon value attributable to the migration of hazardous or toxic substances, or other contaminants that have or may have emanated from other properties. 
Although our tenants are primarily responsible for any environmental damages and claims related to the leased properties, a tenant's bankruptcy or inability to satisfy its obligations for these types of damages or claims could require us to satisfy such liabilities. In addition, we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims irrespective of the provisions of any lease. 
From time to time, in connection with the conduct of our business, we authorize the preparation of environmental reports with respect to our properties. There can be no assurance that these environmental reports will reveal all environmental conditions at the properties in which we have an interest or that the following will not expose us to material liability in the future:
• the discovery of previously unknown environmental conditions; 
• changes in law; 
• activities of prior owners or tenants; 
• activities of current tenants; or 
• activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties. 
Changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of the tenants of our properties, which could materially and adversely affect us.

Emerging Growth Company Status 
We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act"), and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other publicly-traded companies that are not "emerging growth companies," including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). We have elected to utilize the exemption for auditor attestation requirements. 
In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an "emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to "opt out" of this extended transition period, and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for all public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 
We will remain an "emerging growth company" until the earliest to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenue equals or exceeds $1.07 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation); (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a "large accelerated filer" under the Exchange Act. 
Code of Conduct
The Company has adopted a code of conduct that sets forth the principles of conduct and ethics to be followed by our directors, officers, Manager and employees of our Manager who perform services for us (the "Code of Conduct"). The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to promote honest and ethical conduct, compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations, full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in periodic reports, prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Conduct and a culture of honesty and accountability. A copy of the Code of Conduct has been provided to each of our directors, officers, the Manager and relevant employees, who are required to acknowledge that they have received and will comply with the Code of Conduct. A copy of the Company's Code of Conduct has been previously filed with the SEC and is incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 14.1. The Code of Conduct is also available on the Company's website at www.safetyincomegrowth.com. The Company will disclose to shareholders material changes to its Code of Conduct, or any waivers for directors or executive officers, if any, within four business days of any such event. As of December 31, 2018, there have been no amendments to the Code of Conduct and the Company has not granted any waivers from any provision of the Code of Conduct to any directors or executive officers.
