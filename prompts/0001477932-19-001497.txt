ITEM 1 BUSINESS
Background
 
FISION Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in 2010 under a former name, and conducted no active business operations until December 2015 when the Company merged with Fision Holdings, Inc., an operating Minnesota corporation based in Minneapolis (“the Merger”). As a result of the Merger, Fision Holdings, Inc. became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and control of the Company was acquired by the pre-merger shareholders of Fision Holdings, Inc.
 
In May 2017, we acquired substantially all the assets of Volerro Corporation, a Delaware corporation based in Minneapolis and engaged in the development and marketing of proprietary cloud-based “content collaboration” software services. 
 
When used in this report, the terms “the Company,” “Fision,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” refer to FISION Corporation, a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned operating subsidiary Fision Holdings, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (including our Volerro software services).
 
In connection with the 2015 Merger, we issued an aggregate of 28,845,090 shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of Minnesota Fision, and also issued derivative securities to holders of Minnesota Fision options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,868,575 additional shares of our common stock. As a result of this Merger, our pre-merger shareholders plus holders of our pre-merger derivative securities held less than five percent (5%) of our total combined post-merger outstanding common stock plus reserved common stock for all derivative securities.

Effective upon closing the 2015 Merger, the former sole officer and sole director of our parent Delaware corporation resigned from all management positions, and the following persons were appointed to serve as our management following the Merger:
 

Name | Position 
----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Brown | Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Board Chairman and Director 
Garry Lowenthal | Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Director

 
The Merger was accounted for as a “reverse merger” and recapitalization. Accordingly, for financial reporting purposes, our Minnesota Fision subsidiary was the acquirer and the Delaware parent was the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and operations reflected in our historical financial statements prior to the Merger are those of Minnesota Fision and are recorded at their historical cost basis; and our consolidated financial statements after the Merger include assets and liabilities of both the Delaware and Minnesota corporations as well as the post-merger combined historical operations of both corporations. The tax treatment of the Merger constituted a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
 
Effective February 28, 2019, Garry Lowenthal will no longer be the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of FISION Corporation, and will transition into a non-officer role within the company and will also step down from the Board of Directors of FISION Corporation. Effective March 1, 2019, board appointed Daniel Dorsey, age 42, as Chief Financial Officer and as a director of FISION to serve on its Board of Directors until the next regular meeting of shareholders or until his successor is elected.
 
Termination of Continuity Logic Merger

In August 3, 2018 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Continuity Logic, L.L.C., a New Jersey limited liability company (the “Continuity Logic Merger”) to effect a merger resulting in our shareholders as a group and the equity holders of Continuity Logic as a group each owning 50% of the post-merger combined companies. This merger agreement was restated and amended on December 21, 2018. A key provision of this amended Continuity Logic Merger provided that the parties thereto and their representatives were required to raise enough working capital to support the post-merger funding requirements of the combined companies, and that the merger be completed by December 31, 2018. The Company and Continuity Logic conducted extensive due diligence regarding this merger during the last few months of 2018, but were unable to raise or receive future commitments from investors to provide sufficient capital to adequately support the anticipated post-merger combined business operations of the Company and Continuity Logic. Accordingly, on February 4, 2019 Continuity Logic terminated this merger as it was not consummated by December 31, 2018 as well as insufficient working capital being available for post-merger business operations. The Company no longer has any relationship or involvement with the business or future prospects of Continuity Logic.
 
While the Continuity Logic Merger was pending, the Company made various bridge loans to Continuity Logic for working capital, of which a total balance of $817,673 is still outstanding as of March 31, 2019. These loans mature on August 31, 2019, bear interest at 6% per annum, and a portion of the Notes are secured by a first-priority perfected security interest on the accounts receivable of Continuity Logic. The termination of the Continuity Logic Merger does not change or effect the continuing obligation of Continuity Logic to satisfy the future payment of these loans to the Company.
 
Business of Company
 
We are an Internet platform technology company providing proprietary cloud-based software solutions to automate the marketing functions and activities of our customers. Our business is conducted through our Minnesota Fision subsidiary based in Minneapolis, which since 2011 has created and marketed proprietary software solutions to support marketing and sales enablement activities of both private businesses and public entities. We have developed and successfully commercialized a unique cloud-based software platform which automates and integrates all digital marketing assets and marketing communications of our customers, and thus “bridges the gap” between marketing and sales of a business enterprise. We believe that our innovative Fision platform, proprietary technology, forward-looking strategy, and experienced management have now positioned us to become a future leader in the agile marketing and sales enablement segment of the rapidly-growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry. Our primary mission is to develop and offer software technology tools through our Fision platform to enable our customers to maximize their marketing assets and initiatives.
 
We are a global software development and licensing company offering our proprietary Fision software platform to automate and facilitate marketing functions and activities in order to promote and improve sales enablement of any entity. Our innovative software system is readily scalable to adapt to fast business growth of any customer, regardless of size. Except for future customary software enhancements and periodic upgrades, the development of our Fision automated marketing platform has been completed.

Our Fision software platform enables our customers to easily and quickly create and implement marketing campaigns to support their sales personnel while still emphasizing, protecting and enhancing their valuable brand assets. Use of our software solutions by our customers reduces substantially the time and cost incurred by them to produce and present marketing and sales campaigns and presentations for specific products or services. Every member of our customers’ marketing and sales teams, by having easy and automated access to all their digital marketing and media assets, is able to leverage the full power of their distinctive brands and marketing assets in every interaction with their consumers or buyers.
 
Our current and targeted customer base ranges across diverse industries of all sizes, including banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies, hotels and other hospitality enterprises, healthcare and fitness companies, large retailers, product manufacturers, software and other technology companies, telecommunications companies, and numerous other companies selling familiar branded products or services.
 
Fision software provides three major benefits to our customers, which are (i) accelerating their revenues, (ii) improving their marketing and brand effectiveness, and (iii) reducing significantly their marketing and sales costs.
 
We derive our revenues primarily from recurring payments from customers having software licensing contracts typically having terms of one to three years and requiring monthly subscription fees based on the customer’s number of users and locations where used. We currently have licensing contracts with fourteen (14) customers using our Fision platform for their marketing and sales activities. And we are currently engaged in various stages of negotiation with or procurement of several additional material customers. The majority of our revenues are recurring, due to the nature of our contracts.
 
Our typical customer implementation process includes integrating our cloud-based Fision platform with the marketing structure of the customer, initiating and conducting customer training, and providing marketing development support while our Fision platform is being actively launched by the customer. We also continue to provide technical and maintenance support after implementation.
 
We license our proprietary Fision software platform both through direct sales obtained by our management and other in-house sales personnel, and through utilizing experienced independent national sales agencies known as our “channel partners.” To date we have entered into three significant channel partnership arrangements, and we have realized material revenues from the efforts of our channel partners.
 
The Fision Platform - Our Fision marketing software centrally collects, stores, prioritizes, organizes, streamlines, integrates and distributes the numerous digital marketing assets of our customers including videos, images, logos and other brand materials, presentations, social media content and any other material marketing assets. Using Fision’s automated software technology, these digital assets then become readily and immediately available for user access as determined by each of our customers. Our Fision platform is designed to provide any corporate marketing department with the ability to instantly and seamlessly update its sales force or other users with the latest digital marketing content and materials, while providing them with a simple, intuitive software interface to quickly find what they need on any digital device, anytime and anywhere. In particular, large enterprise customers with extensive global sales branches and networks have the ability to quickly and efficiently create and deliver customized sales campaigns or presentations to selectively targeted consumer audiences while conveying a positive, personalized and consistent brand experience. We believe that the use of our software marketing solutions by our customers results in a substantial increase in their return on investment (ROI) and their profitability.

Our Customers - Our potential customer base is global and virtually unlimited, since our Fision platform software solutions are totally cloud-based and readily scalable, and provide a multitude of digital tools and solutions which can provide significant benefits to the marketing and sales personnel of any commercial enterprise, regardless of size and widespread locations.
 
Our customers typically “stick” with us and our Fision platform, and accordingly we receive substantial recurring revenues from them on a consistent basis. Certain customers have maintained written contracts with us for several years. We regard our high percentage of recurring revenues to be particularly significant to our marketing strategy which emphasizes long-term relationships with our customers under written contracts. We believe that our ability to realize such recurring revenues is a keystone feature of our business model.
 
Significant Marketing Developments
 
For the past couple years, our primary marketing strategy has been directed toward and focused on large enterprise companies with many widespread operations and personnel. We have succeeded in closing key licensing contracts with large enterprise customers in various industries, including the following:

· | a worldwide provider of SaaS software services for procurement and contract management. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | a Fortune 50 global provider of aerospace and building systems. 
· | a nationwide leading provider of accredited online higher education courses and degrees. 
· | the world’s largest RV dealership with retail operations in Florida, Colorado and Arizona.
· | a national insurance and financial company having more than 20,000 employees and advisors.
· | an operator of the world’s largest business network. 
· | a leading healthcare innovator led by former key executives of Amazon, Google and 2d.MD. 

 
We believe these significant large enterprise customers now using our Fision platform will result in a substantial increase in future recurring revenues from our cloud-based Fision platform.

Cloud-Based Platform -Storage and operation of our software solutions platform along with the digital marketing and sales assets and related data of our customers are outsourced by us to reside and take place in the digital “cloud.” Providers of cloud services are typically referred to as “virtual servers” since they provide all digital data storage and software application services to their clients. Our cloud service provider is Microsoft’s Azure Cloud, which leading cloud-based platform offers readily scalable, high quality and secure cloud services capable of satisfying any increasing demand or changing circumstances in the needs of our customers or us.
 
We regard the hosting of our software applications, the ready digital interface with our customers, and the storage of unlimited customer data, with our premier cloud provider as being crucial to our operating strategy. Our major savings in expensive computer equipment, high salaried technology personnel, and costly security measures through our use of Microsoft’s cloud is vital to our cost of doing business. Moreover, we believe that our experienced and leading cloud provider is more effective in delivering our Fision software solutions to our customers than we could perform in any event.
 
Research and Development - Since inception, the Company has committed substantial financial, personnel and other resources toward research and development efforts and activities related to the integration, commercialization and improvement of the Fision proprietary software platform. 
 
Our development activities are conducted both internally from our Minneapolis headquarters facility by our experienced development programmers and software architects, and externally from outsourced contracts with experienced independent software development companies and individuals. We own servers and other computer equipment located at our Minneapolis facility, which are used by our development personnel to develop and enhance our marketing software platform.
 
Our Industry
 
We are positioned in the marketing/sales segment of the broad software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry, which segment we believe from available industry data now represents annual revenues of at least $20 Billion. Corporate spending on software applications and other intellectual technology (IT) has been growing at a rapid pace for many years in order to capitalize on the benefits of digital information technology. Moreover, a large amount of that spending now is being directed to support and enhance corporate marketing and sales efforts and activities. For many corporations, marketing software technologies have evolved to become a fundamental component of IT purchasing. 
Marketing
 
We market and sell licensing rights to our proprietary Fision software platform under written contracts with our customers typically having one to three-year terms. A majority of our historical customers and revenues were procured primarily through direct sales obtained by our management and in-house sales force. Our marketing and related sales efforts and activities include generating sales leads and contract proposals with customers through our direct sales force, our management and their personal business contacts, and other persons affiliated or associated with us. Our direct marketing and sales efforts are supported by various secondary activities including participation in selected industry trade shows and conventions, certain print and digital media advertising and promotion, and solution overviews and presentations posted on our website. 
 
Over the past couple years, we also have developed and implemented a secondary sales channel which involves targeting and retaining key independent national sales agencies to sell (license) our branded software products as sales agents paid commissions based on their actual sales. We regard and refer to these sales agencies as our “channel partners.” To date we have entered into three significant channel partner arrangements with experienced agencies, and we have realized material revenues from their sales efforts.
