ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
We are a global oncology company with a proprietary platform technology called Tumor Treating Fields ("TTFields"), which are electric fields tuned to specific frequencies that disrupt cancer cell division. Our key priorities are to drive commercial adoption of Optune and Optune Lua, our commercial TTFields devices, and to advance clinical and product development programs intended to extend overall survival in some of the most aggressive forms of cancer.
Optune is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") under the Premarket Approval ("PMA") pathway for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma ("GBM") together with temozolomide, a chemotherapy drug, and for adult patients with GBM following confirmed recurrence after chemotherapy as monotherapy treatment. We also have a CE certificate to market Optune for the treatment of GBM in the European Union ("EU"), as well as approval or local registration in the United Kingdom ("UK"), Japan and certain other countries. Optune Lua is approved by the FDA under the Humanitarian Device Exemption ("HDE") pathway to treatment malignant pleural mesothelioma ("MPM") together with standard chemotherapies. We have also received CE certification in the EU and approval or local registration to market Optune Lua in certain other countries. We market Optune and Optune Lua in multiple countries around the globe with the majority of our revenues coming from the use of Optune in the U.S., Germany and Japan. We are actively evaluating and executing upon opportunities to expand our international footprint. 
We believe the physical mechanism of action behind TTFields therapy may be broadly applicable to solid tumor cancers. Currently, we are conducting phase 3 pivotal studies evaluating the use of TTFields in non-small cell lung cancer ("NSCLC"), ovarian cancer, brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer ("brain metastases") and pancreatic cancer. In 2021, we completed patient enrollment in our phase 3 pivotal NSCLC and ovarian cancer studies with data anticipated in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, we have multiple ongoing phase 2 pilot studies evaluating the use of TTFields in gastric cancer, for which patient enrollment is complete, and stage 3 NSCLC, as well as testing the potential incremental survival benefit of TTFields delivered using high-intensity arrays versus standard arrays. We are designing several phase 2 pilot studies in partnership with oncology leaders to further explore the capabilities of TTFields. We are also currently conducting a global phase 4 post-marketing study testing the potential survival benefit of initiating Optune concurrent with radiation therapy versus following radiation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. In 2021, we presented data from our phase 2 pilot study studying the use of TTFields in liver cancer and are currently evaluating protocol design options for a large, randomized study in this indication. We anticipate expanding our clinical pipeline over time to study the safety and efficacy of TTFields for additional solid tumor indications and combinations with other cancer treatment modalities. 
Our therapy is delivered through a medical device and we continue to advance our Products with the intention to extend survival and maintain quality of life for patients. We have several product development programs underway that are designed to optimize TTFields delivery to the target tumor and enhance patient ease of use. Our intellectual property portfolio contains hundreds of issued patents and numerous patent applications pending worldwide. We believe we possess global commercialization rights to our Products in oncology and are well-positioned to extend those rights into the future as we continue to find innovative ways to improve our Products.
In 2018, we granted Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. ("Zai") a license to commercialize Optune in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan ("Greater China") under a License and Collaboration Agreement (the "Zai Agreement"). The Zai Agreement also establishes a development partnership intended to accelerate the development of TTFields in multiple solid tumor cancer indications. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our therapy
When cancer develops, rapid and uncontrolled division of unhealthy cells occurs. Electrically charged proteins within the cell are critical for cell division, making the rapidly dividing cancer cells vulnerable to electrical 
interference. TTFields therapy is a treatment that uses electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cancer cell division.
All cells are surrounded by a bilipid membrane, which separates the interior of the cell, or cytoplasm, from the space around it. This membrane prevents low frequency electric fields from entering the cell. TTFields, however, have a unique frequency range, between 100 to 500 kHz, enabling the electric fields to penetrate the cancer cell membrane. As healthy cells differ from cancer cells in their division rate, geometry and electric properties, the frequency of TTFields can be tuned to specifically affect the cancer cells while leaving healthy cells mostly unaffected. 
Whether cells are healthy or cancerous, cell division, or mitosis, is the same. When mitosis starts, charged proteins within the cell, or microtubules, form the mitotic spindle. The spindle is built on electric interaction between its building blocks. During division, the mitotic spindle segregates the chromosomes, pulling them in opposite directions. As the daughter cells begin to form, electrically polarized molecules migrate towards the midline to make up the mitotic cleavage furrow. The furrow contracts and the two daughter cells separate. TTFields can interfere with these conditions. When TTFields are present in a dividing cancer cell, they cause the electrically charged proteins to align with the directional forces applied by the field, thus preventing the mitotic spindle from forming. Electrical forces also interrupt the migration of key proteins to the cell midline, disrupting the formation of the mitotic cleavage furrow. Interfering with these key processes disrupts mitosis and can lead to cell death. 
Our track record of fundamental scientific research extends across more than two decades and, in all of our preclinical research to date, the application of TTFields has demonstrated a consistent anti-mitotic effect. Recent preclinical work suggests that the well-established impairment created by the physical effect of TTFields to tumor cells results in a series of changes to cell processes that inhibit DNA damage repair, induce autophagy, reduce cell migration and invasion, and increase anti-tumor immunity. Research is ongoing to further refine and build upon our understanding of TTFields' several mechanisms of action. Beyond our internal research efforts, we provide independent researchers with preclinical laboratory bench systems, known as inovitro™ and inovivo™, and we grant funding to support basic and translational research on TTFields. We also support independent research through our Investigator-Sponsored Trials and Preclinical Material Transfer Agreement programs in order to enhance our understanding of the optimal use of TTFields.
TTFields is intended principally for use together with other standard-of-care cancer treatments. There is a growing body of evidence that supports TTFields' broad applicability with certain other cancer therapies, including radiation therapy, certain chemotherapies and certain immunotherapies. In our clinical research and commercial experience to date, TTFields has exhibited no systemic toxicity, with mild to moderate skin irritation being the most common side effect. 
Our technology
TTFields therapy is delivered through a portable medical device. The complete devices, called Optune and Optune Lua (for GBM and MPM treatment, respectively), include a portable electric field generator, arrays, rechargeable batteries and accessories. Sterile, single-use arrays are placed directly on the skin in the region surrounding the tumor and connected to the electric field generator to deliver therapy. Arrays are changed when hair growth or the hydrogel reduces array adhesion to the skin. The therapy is designed to be delivered continuously throughout the day and night, and efficacy is strongly correlated to time on therapy. When the device is turned on, TTFields are continuously generated within the specific region of the body covered by the arrays. Healthy tissues located outside of this region remain unaffected by the therapy. The electric field generator can be run from a standard power outlet or carried with a battery in a specially designed bag that we provide to patients.
We plan to use the same field generator technology across all indications for which our Products are approved. We plan to specifically target individual solid tumor types by optimizing field generator parameters such as frequency and power output. Our arrays have been developed and are in use, either commercially or clinically, for application on the head, thorax and abdomen.
Through engineering efforts, we plan to continue to advance our Products to optimize TTFields therapy for patients. We have several product development programs underway designed to extend survival and enhance quality of life. Our product development programs are primarily focused on enhancements to the field generator, arrays and software applications. Our product development initiatives include, but are not limited to: next generation arrays that are more flexible and deliver higher intensities, next generation array layout planning software, development of a third generation device that optimizes the use of electric fields to treat tumors, and patient-centered software that enables scaled patient support as we prepare to treat larger patient populations across multiple indications. Our 
ultimate goal is to optimize the energy delivered to patients' tumors, potentially improving efficacy. Any enhancements will be subject to applicable regulatory reviews and approvals.
Our commercial business
Optune is currently marketed for the treatment of GBM, the most common form of primary brain cancer and an aggressive disease for which there are few effective treatment options. Optune Lua is currently marketed for the treatment of MPM, a rare cancer that has been strongly linked to asbestos exposure. We market Optune and Optune Lua in multiple countries around the globe with the majority of our revenues coming from the use of Optune in the U.S., Germany and Japan. 
Treatment of newly diagnosed GBM
In 2015, we received FDA approval to market Optune for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial GBM in combination with temozolomide. The FDA approved Optune for newly diagnosed GBM based on the EF-14 study ("EF-14"), which was a randomized, phase 3 pivotal clinical study which compared, post radiation, Optune plus temozolomide versus temozolomide alone for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival and a powered secondary endpoint was overall survival.
In EF-14, Optune plus temozolomide demonstrated unprecedented five-year survival results. Median overall survival was extended by nearly five months (median overall survival of 20.9 months versus 16.0 months for temozolomide alone). Median progression-free survival was extended by 2.7 months to 6.7 months for Optune plus temozolomide from 4.0 months for temozolomide alone. The final EF-14 data were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2017.
The following graph presents the overall survival data in the intent-to-treat population from our five-year analysis:
The extension of progression-free and overall survival in patients receiving Optune in combination with temozolomide in EF-14 was not specific to any prognostic subgroup or tumor genetic marker and was consistent regardless of MGMT methylation status, extent of resection, age, performance status or gender. Optune was safely combined with temozolomide with no significant increase in serious adverse events compared with temozolomide alone. The most common side effect related to Optune was mild to moderate skin irritation.
Quality of life data from a pre-specified analysis of EF-14 demonstrated that patients treated with Optune and temozolomide maintained quality of life over time and across predefined daily-functioning domains. Both healthcare professionals and patients reported stable quality of life evaluation scores up to one year of Optune use. Physical, role, social, emotional and cognitive functioning for patients treated with Optune and temozolomide all remained stable and comparable with patients treated with temozolomide alone.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology® (NCCN Guidelines®) for Central Nervous Systems Cancers were updated to include alternating electric fields therapy (Optune) in combination with temozolomide following standard brain radiation therapy with concurrent temozolomide as a 
Category 1 recommended postoperative adjuvant treatment option for patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial GBM.
A post-hoc analysis of EF-14 showed that more time on Optune predicted increased survival in GBM patients. An Optune monthly usage threshold as low as 50 percent correlated with significantly improved outcomes in patients treated with Optune together with temozolomide compared to patients treated with temozolomide alone. The greater the patients’ monthly usage of Optune, the better their outcomes. Patients who used Optune more than 90 percent of the time (n=43) had the greatest chance of survival: a median survival of 24.9 months from randomization and a five-year probability of survival of 29.3 percent.
A separate post-hoc analysis of EF-14 showed that higher intensities at the tumor bed were associated with increased survival in GBM patients. Patients treated with Optune at higher intensities (greater than or equal to 1.06 V/cm; n=119) had a median overall survival of 24.3 months compared to a median overall survival of 21.6 months for patients treated with Optune at lower intensities (less than 1.06 V/cm; n=221).
In these analyses, both time on therapy and higher levels of energy (power loss density) were associated with improved overall survival, independent of each other. In addition, patients who used Optune at least 18 hours per day at higher energy levels (n=78) had a median overall survival of 25.1 months (95% CI 20.8-39.4).
Treatment of recurrent GBM
We initially received FDA approval for Optune in 2011 for use as a monotherapy treatment for adult patients with GBM, following confirmed recurrence after chemotherapy. The FDA approved Optune based on the EF-11 study ("EF-11"), a randomized, phase 3 pivotal clinical study.
EF-11 was a multi-center, active controlled clinical study of 237 adults with recurrent GBM. Participants received either Optune as a monotherapy (n=120) or the physician’s choice of chemotherapy (n=117). Chemotherapies chosen for the active control arm included mainly bevacizumab, nitrosoureas and temozolomide. The primary endpoint was superiority in overall survival. Overall survival for patients treated with Optune alone and active chemotherapy was 6.6 months and 6.0 months, respectively (p=0.27: HR = 0.86). The study demonstrated that Optune provided clinically comparable survival with an overall better quality of life.
More objective radiological responses were observed in the Optune group than in the active control chemotherapy group (14 patients versus 7 patients). Three patients in the Optune alone arm had a complete response versus no patients in the active chemotherapy arm. 
In 2020, the EF-19 post-approval registry, which was a post-approval study required as a condition of FDA approval, confirmed the effectiveness and safety of Optune as monotherapy and further strengthened Optune's clinical profile in recurrent GBM. The EF-19 study studied Optune as a monotherapy for the treatment of recurrent GBM in 192 patients compared to the 117 recurrent GBM patients who received best standard of care chemotherapy in Novocure’s EF-11 registration study. Optune as monotherapy reduced the risk of death with fewer adverse events compared to best standard of care chemotherapy. For patients who received at least one course of therapy, Optune prolonged survival by a median 1.7 months. No new safety signals were noted.
Treatment of MPM
In 2019, we received FDA approval via the HDE pathway to market Optune Lua (then known as NovoTTF-100L) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic MPM concurrent with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy. The FDA approved Optune Lua for MPM based on the STELLAR study ("STELLAR"). STELLAR was a single-arm, open-label, multi-center study designed to test the safety and efficacy of Optune in combination with pemetrexed combined with cisplatin or carboplatin in patients with unresectable, previously untreated MPM. The study was powered to prospectively determine the overall survival in patients treated with Optune Lua plus chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (per mRECIST criteria), progression-free survival and safety.
STELLAR investigated safety and efficacy among 80 patients treated with Optune Lua plus standard of care chemotherapy. In STELLAR, the median overall survival was 18.2 months (95% CI, 12.1-25.8 months) across all patients treated with Optune Lua plus chemotherapy. The median overall survival was 21.2 months for patients with epithelioid MPM (n=53) and 12.1 months for patients with non-epithelioid MPM (n=27). 62% of patients enrolled in STELLAR who used Optune Lua plus chemotherapy were still alive at one year, with 42% of patients alive at two years. The disease control rate in patients with at least one follow-up CT scan performed (n=72) was 97%. 40% of 
patients had a partial response, 57% had stable disease, and 3% had progressive disease. The median progression-free survival was 7.6 months (95% CI, 6.7-8.6 months).
There was no increase in serious systemic adverse events when Optune Lua was added to chemotherapy. Mild-to-moderate skin irritation was the only device-related side effect with Optune Lua. The STELLAR data were published in The Lancet Oncology in 2019.
Our commercial markets
We have built a commercial organization and market Optune and Optune Lua for the treatment of GBM and MPM in multiple countries in North America, Europe and Asia. 
In 2022, we estimate that approximately:
•15,000 people will be diagnosed with GBM or tumors that typically progress to GBM in the U.S. Of this population, we estimate that approximately 8,200 patients who are candidates for treatment with Optune based upon the rate of disease progression and medical eligibility will actively seek treatment.
•4,600 people will be diagnosed with GBM or tumors that typically progress to GBM in Germany. Of this population, we estimate that approximately 2,500 patients who are candidates for treatment with Optune based upon the rate of disease progression and medical eligibility will actively seek treatment.
•2,200 people will be diagnosed with GBM or tumors that typically progress to GBM in Japan. Of this population, we estimate that approximately 1,200 patients who are candidates for treatment with Optune based upon the rate of disease progression and medical eligibility will actively seek treatment.
In 2022, we estimate that approximately 3,000 people are diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma in the U.S. each year. Of this population, we estimate that approximately 1,600 patients are candidates for treatment with Optune Lua based upon the rate of disease progression and medical eligibility.
We believe there are many more patients who could benefit from treatment with TTFields than are currently on therapy. We continue to focus on increasing penetration for GBM and MPM. In the future, we anticipate strategically expanding into additional geographic markets and additional indications, pending regulatory approval.
Commercial execution
As of December 31, 2021, we had 87 sales force colleagues globally. Healthcare providers must undergo a certification training in order to prescribe our Products.
With respect to the treatment of GBM, our sales and marketing efforts are principally focused on driving adoption with both neuro-oncologists and radiation oncologists. In certain countries, neurosurgeons and medical oncologists also drive adoption. We continue to focus on driving key academic center engagements. 
With respect to the treatment of MPM, our sales and marketing efforts are principally focused on certification training, supporting the required Institutional Review Board approval process in certain geographies, and driving awareness among radiation oncologists and thoracic oncologists. We believe the benefit of our education efforts will extend beyond MPM to future indications treated by the same prescribers and that radiation oncologists will continue to play an increasingly important role in driving adoption of our Products in both current and future indications.
We currently operate as a direct-to-patient distributor of our Products, except for Japan. In Japan, we distribute Optune through hospitals and provide patient support services under a contractual arrangement with the hospital. Once an eligible patient is identified by a certified prescriber, the healthcare provider’s office submits a prescription order form and supporting documentation to us. We employ a team of Device Support Specialists who provide technical training to the patient and any caregivers. Once treatment is initiated, we provide 24/7 technical support for patients and caregivers as well as assistance with insurance reimbursement. We also provide the healthcare provider and the patient with a usage report for monitoring patient time on therapy. We believe we have the experience and expertise to scale our sales and marketing efforts. 
Billing and reimbursement
We provide our Products directly to patients following receipt of a prescription order and a signed patient service agreement (except in Japan as described above). The number of active patients on therapy and the amount of net revenue recognized per active patient are our principal revenue drivers. An active patient is a patient who is receiving treatment under a commercial prescription order as of the measurement date, including patients who may be on a temporary break from treatment and who plan to resume treatment in less than 60 days. Growth in the number of active patients is a factor of both new patient starts and treatment duration. Median treatment duration differs based upon the patient's clinical diagnosis. 
We bill payers a single monthly fee for a month of therapy and we bear the financial risk of securing payment from third-party payers and patients in all markets except for Japan. We distribute our Products through hospitals in Japan with the hospitals receiving reimbursement from the government-mandated insurance program and in turn contracting with us for the equipment, supplies and services necessary to treat patients with our Product.
Currently, the monthly list price for our therapy in the U.S. is $21,000 and we have set list prices outside of the United States that are approximately equivalent to this price, subject to currency fluctuations. We typically negotiate discounts from our list price with healthcare payers, and in certain cases we accept government-mandated discounts from our list prices in order to secure reimbursement for our Products.
We continue to work with payers to expand access to Optune for patients with GBM. As of December 31, 2021, we have received national reimbursement for Optune in Austria, Germany, Israel, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland.
In the U.S., a substantial majority of Americans with private health insurance had coverage of Optune for newly diagnosed GBM and/or recurrent GBM as of December 31, 2021. As of September 2019, Americans who are beneficiaries of the Medicare fee-for-service program also have coverage of Optune for newly diagnosed GBM. We believe we have completed our administrative ramp-up towards processing Medicare claims and are efficiently pursuing appeals. We are actively appealing Medicare fee-for-service coverage denials up to and including the Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") process with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). 
We are engaged in an initial dialogue with certain payers regarding access to Optune Lua for patients with MPM. We anticipate that MPM claims during initial commercialization will go through an appeal process with payers, similar to our early experience with GBM. We anticipate that our ability to gain meaningful coverage for Optune Lua will be dependent on inclusion in the relevant clinical guidelines for MPM. 
Our development pipeline
Based on the results of our preclinical research, we have developed a pipeline strategy to advance TTFields through phase 2 pilot, phase 3 pivotal studies and phase 4 post-marketing studies across multiple solid tumor types. We anticipate expanding our clinical pipeline over time to include additional solid tumor cancer indications.
Current Development Pipeline
The solid tumor cancers subject to our phase 2 pilot, phase 3 pivotal, and phase 4 post-marketing studies, as well as the studies themselves, are described in greater detail below.
Glioblastoma
We continue to conduct research in our approved indications to further advance the scientific evidence supporting the use of TTFields in GBM and to gather additional information about our therapy's optimal use.
2-THE-TOP phase 2 pilot study
In November 2021, Dr. David Tran, Chief of the Division of Neuro-Oncology at the McKnight Brain Institute at the University of Florida, presented updated data from the phase 2 pilot 2-THE-TOP study testing the safety and efficacy of TTFields together with pembrolizumab and temozolomide for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed GBM. As of May 24, 2021 25 patients with a median age of 61 years were enrolled in the study, with a median follow-up of 14.7 months. 32% had biopsy only and 16% had partial resection. 72% had unmethylated MGMT and 12% had an IDH mutation. 48% were progression-free, and 60% were still alive. Of the 19 patients with follow-up greater than 9 months, the median progression-free survival was at least 11.2 months compared to 6.7 months from the historical control study, EF-14, in which patients received TTFields and adjuvant temozolomide. 24% patients with measurable tumors achieved partial or complete response. 193,760 peripheral blood mononuclear cells were sequenced in 12 patients before pembrolizumab and detected robust post-TTFields T cell activation in 11 of 12 patients via the T1IFN trajectory with a strong correlation with the TCRαβ clonal expansion Simpson index (Spearman coefficient r=-0.8, P=0.014). The study defined a T cell-based gene signature of TTFields effects on TCRαβ clonal expansion. The most common adverse events were thrombosis (16%), seizure (12%), and metabolic disturbances (8%). 2-THE-TOP concluded that the triple combination of TTFields, temozolomide, and pembrolizumab is well tolerated and shows early evidence of efficacy in newly diagnosed GBM patients. Patients will continue follow-up with survival and molecular data to be updated.
EF-33 phase 2 pilot study
In 2020, we enrolled the first patient in our EF-33 study, an open-label, single-arm phase 2 pilot clinical study to study if Optune delivered at 200 kHz to the brain using high-intensity arrays in the treatment of recurrent GBM significantly improves the clinical outcomes of patients compared to using standard transducer arrays. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, progression-free survival rate at six months, overall survival rate at one year and two years, overall radiological response, and severity and 
frequency of adverse events. All comparisons will be made against historical control data from the EF-11 study. EF-33 is expected to enroll 25 patients and we anticipate data will be available in 2022.
TRIDENT phase 4 post-marketing study
In 2020, we enrolled the first patient in our TRIDENT study ("TRIDENT"), a phase 4 post-marketing study testing the potential survival benefit of initiating Optune concurrent with radiation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The primary endpoint is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, survival rates at one and two years, overall radiological response, severity and frequency of adverse effects, pathological changes in resected GBM tumors post treatment, quality of life, and correlation of overall survival to TTFields dose. TRIDENT is designed to accrue 950 patients with 24 months minimum follow-up after the last patient enrolled.
Non-small cell lung cancer
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. It is estimated that approximately 193,000 patients are diagnosed with NSCLC each year in the U.S.
Physicians use different combinations of surgery, radiation and pharmacological therapies to treat NSCLC, depending on the stage of the disease. Surgery, which may be curative in a subset of patients, is usually used in early stages of the disease. Since 1991, radiation with a combination of platinum-based chemotherapy drugs has been the first line standard of care for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Certain immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been approved for the first line treatment of NSCLC and the standard of care in this setting appears to be evolving rapidly. The standard of care for second line treatment is also evolving and may include platinum-based chemotherapy for patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors as their first line regimen, pemetrexed, docetaxel or immune checkpoint inhibitors.
EF-15 phase 2 pilot study
In 2013, we published the results of our phase 2 pilot study, the EF-15 study ("EF-15"), evaluating the safety and efficacy of TTFields in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. EF-15 focused on the effects of treatment with TTFields in combination with standard of care pemetrexed chemotherapy. Results of the pemetrexed phase 3 pivotal FDA registration study were used as a historical control in this study.
A total of 42 patients were recruited to the study with a minimum follow-up of six months. Efficacy results based on 41 evaluable patients showed both progression-free survival and overall survival for patients receiving TTFields in combination with pemetrexed increased compared to historical control data for pemetrexed alone. Median time to in-field progression in the TTFields-treated group was 6.5 months (compared to 2.9 months in the historical control) and median overall survival was 13.8 months (compared to 8.3 months in the historical control). Adverse events reported in this combination study were comparable to those reported with pemetrexed alone, suggesting minimal added toxicities due to TTFields.
LUNAR phase 3 pivotal study
In 2017, we enrolled the first patient in our LUNAR study ("LUNAR"), a phase 3 pivotal study testing the effectiveness of TTFields in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors or docetaxel versus immune checkpoint inhibitors or docetaxel alone for patients with stage 4 NSCLC who progressed during or after platinum-based therapy. It is estimated that approximately 46,000 patients receive second-line treatment for stage 4 NSCLC each year in the U.S. The primary endpoint is superior overall survival of patients treated with TTFields plus immune checkpoint inhibitors or docetaxel versus immune checkpoint inhibitors or docetaxel alone. We believe our protocol incorporates the evolving standard of care for second-line treatment of NSCLC. TTFields is intended principally for use in combination with other standard-of-care treatments, and LUNAR was designed to generate data that contemplates multiple outcomes, all of which we believe will be clinically meaningful. 
In April 2021, we announced that an independent Data Monitoring Committee ("DMC") informed us that the pre-specified interim analysis for the LUNAR study was accelerated given the length of accrual and the number of events observed, to date. The interim analysis included data from 210 patients accrued through February 2021. After review of the interim analysis, the DMC concluded that the LUNAR study should continue with no evidence of increased systemic toxicity. The DMC went on to comment that the continued accrual to 534 patients as proposed in the original protocol, given the current rate of accrual and the interim data presented, is likely unnecessary and 
possibly unethical for patients randomized to control. For this reason, the DMC recommended an adjustment of accrual to approximately 276 patients with a 12-month follow-up following the enrollment of the last patient. The DMC believed this amended protocol would provide adequate data regarding toxicity and efficacy, providing sufficient overall power, as well as potentially providing important information regarding efficacy within treatment subgroups. In May 2021, the FDA approved our investigational device exemption supplement incorporating the recommended protocol changes and we enrolled our last LUNAR patient in November 2021. We anticipate data in 2022.
KEYNOTE B36 phase 2 pilot study
In July 2020, we entered into a clinical study collaboration with MSD, a trade name of Merck & Co., Inc. through a subsidiary, to study TTFields together with MSD’s anti-PD-1 therapy pembrolizumab for treatment of first-line NSCLC, expanding our research in the lung cancer space. In April 2021, the FDA approved our IDE application to initiate the KEYNOTE B36 phase 2 pilot study to study TTFields with pembrolizumab in first-line NSCLC. As of December 31, 2021 there were nine KEYNOTE B36 clinical study sites actively evaluating patients for enrollment.
Brain metastases
Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from the place where it first started to another place in the body. In metastasis, cancer cells break away from where they first formed (the primary cancer), travel through the blood or lymph system, and form new tumors (the metastatic tumors) in other parts of the body. The exact incidence of brain metastases is unknown because no national cancer registry documents brain metastases, and estimates from scientific literature vary greatly based on the study methodology applied. It is estimated that between 100,000 and 240,000 new cases are diagnosed in the U.S. each year with brain metastases estimated to occur in between 10% to 40% of all cancer patients.
Brain metastases are commonly treated with a combination of surgery and radiation. Chemotherapy is often given for the primary tumor, but many chemotherapy agents do not cross the blood brain barrier and are thus ineffective in the treatment of brain metastases. When brain metastases appear, they are either surgically removed or treated with radiation using stereotactic radiosurgery ("SRS") when possible. Whole brain radiation therapy, although effective in delaying progression or recurrence of brain metastases when given either before or after SRS, is associated with neurotoxicity and a significant decline in cognitive functioning. Thus, whole brain radiation therapy is often delayed until later in the disease course and is often used as a last resort. This practice results in a window of unmet need after localized surgery and SRS are used and before whole brain radiation therapy is administered to delay or prevent the additional spread of brain metastases.
METIS phase 3 pivotal study
In 2016, we enrolled the first patient in our METIS study ("METIS"), a phase 3 pivotal study testing the effectiveness of SRS plus TTFields compared to SRS alone in patients with brain metastases resulting from NSCLC. It is estimated that between 20 to 40% of patients with NSCLC develop brain metastases, with an estimated 38,000 to 77,000 patients diagnosed each year in the U.S. with brain metastases resulting from NSCLC. The primary endpoint of METIS is time to first intracranial progression. Secondary endpoints include, among others, time to neurocognitive failure, overall survival and radiological response rate following study treatments. The study is designed to accrue 270 patients with data analyzed 12 months after the last patient in. We anticipate data will be available in 2023.
Liver cancer
Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and is the sixth leading cause of cancer deaths annually in the U.S. The incidence of liver cancer is approximately 42,000 new cases annually in the U.S. The five-year survival rate with existing standards of care is less than 20%.
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most widespread type of cancer that originates from the liver. Advanced liver cancer has spread either to the lymph nodes or to other organs and, because these cancers are widespread, they cannot be treated with surgery. The current common standard treatment for patients with advanced disease and those who progressed on loco-regional therapy is systemic therapy with sorafenib, lenvatinib, or atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.
In September 2021, we announced that the FDA granted breakthrough designation to the NovoTTF-200T System, a TTFields device intended for use together with atezolizumab and bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic liver cancer. The designation offers us an opportunity to interact with FDA experts throughout the premarket review phase and allows for prioritized review of regulatory submissions.
HEPANOVA phase 2 pilot study
In 2018, we opened our HEPANOVA study, a single-arm, phase 2 pilot clinical study in liver cancer testing the safety and efficacy of TTFields in combination with sorafenib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular cancer that are not eligible for standard local therapies or surgery. The primary endpoint is overall response rate, and secondary endpoints include progression-free and overall survival at one year. 
In July 2021, we announced the final results of the HEPANOVA study. Historical control data showed a 4.5% objective response rate and a 43% disease control rate for patients treated with sorafenib alone. In 21 evaluable patients, HEPANOVA showed a 9.5% objective response rate and 76% disease control rate, as well as 5.8 months of progression free survival. These results are even more encouraging when considering the poor prognosis of the study population. 52% of the patients in HEPANOVA were categorized as Child-Pugh Class B, compared to 5% in the historical control, indicating significant liver functional compromise. Additionally, research conducted to date has shown that TTFields anti-mitotic effect requires extended exposure to the therapy for maximum impact. This was a challenge given median patient treatment duration of only 10 weeks during the study. Of the patients who received at least 12 weeks of therapy, the disease control rate reached 91% with an objective response rate of 18%. These data demonstrate that TTFields have the potential to extend survival in advanced liver cancer. Our team, along with study investigators, are actively designing a phase 3 pivotal study that contemplates TTFields therapy together with the current standard of care, including immunotherapy. 
Gastric cancer
Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer deaths in China. The incidence of gastric cancer is approximately 478,500 new cases annually in China, and approximately 26,000 new cases annually in the U.S. The five-year overall survival rate of gastric cancer is approximately 36%. 
Current therapies include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy. A commonly used chemotherapy regimen in treating gastric cancer is XELOX, a combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine. In patients diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer that is no longer operable, combination chemotherapy extends progression-free survival and overall survival to 3-6 months and 8-14 months, respectively.
EF-31 phase 2 pilot study
In 2020, we opened our EF-31 study, a single-arm, phase 2 pilot clinical study in gastric cancer in partnership with Zai testing the safety and efficacy of TTFields together with XELOX chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with unresectable gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed objective response rate, and secondary endpoints include progression-free and overall survival. The protocol is designed to include 25 evaluable patients who receive at least one tumor assessment. In October 2021, we announced the final patient was enrolled in the study and data is anticipated in 2022.
Ovarian cancer
In the U.S., ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women, with approximately 24,000 women diagnosed each year. Ovarian cancer incidence increases with age, and the median age at time of diagnosis is 63 years old.
Physicians use different combinations of surgery and pharmacological therapies to treat ovarian cancer, depending on the stage of the disease. Surgery is usually used in early stages of the disease and is usually combined with chemotherapy, including paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the cancer has spread outside of the ovaries to include regional tissue involvement and/or metastases. Platinum-based chemotherapy remains part of the standard of care in advanced ovarian cancer, but most patients with advanced ovarian cancer will have tumor progression or, more commonly, recurrence. Almost all patients with recurrent disease ultimately develop platinum resistance, and the prognosis for this population remains poor.
INNOVATE phase 2 pilot study
In 2018, we published the results of our phase 2 pilot study in recurrent ovarian cancer, the INNOVATE study ("INNOVATE"), examining TTFields in combination with standard of care chemotherapy. INNOVATE was a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label study designed to test the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of TTFields in combination with weekly paclitaxel. The paclitaxel control arm from the bevacizumab phase 3 pivotal FDA registration study was used as a historical control in this study.
A total of 31 patients were recruited to the study with a minimum follow-up of six months. Safety results suggested that TTFields in combination with weekly paclitaxel may be tolerable and safe as second-line treatment for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Median progression-free survival in the TTFields-treated group was 8.9 months (compared to 3.9 months in the paclitaxel-alone historical control), and median overall survival was not yet reached. The one-year survival rate was 61%. Efficacy results based on the 31 evaluable patients suggested more than doubling of the progression-free survival and an improvement in overall survival among patients who received TTFields therapy with paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone.
INNOVATE-3 phase 3 pivotal study
In 2019, we enrolled the first patient in our INNOVATE-3 study ("INNOVATE-3"), a phase 3 pivotal study testing the effectiveness of TTFields with paclitaxel in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. It is estimated that approximately 16,000 patients are diagnosed with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer each year in the U.S. The primary endpoint of INNOVATE-3 is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, objective response rate, severity and frequency of adverse events, time to undisputable deterioration in health-related quality of life or death, and quality of life. The study is designed to accrue 540 patients with data analyzed 18 months after the last patient in. In October 2021, we announced that the final patient was enrolled in the pivotal INNOVATE-3 study. A DMC will conduct the pre-specified interim analysis pursuant to the study protocol in 2022 and data is anticipated in 2023.The European Network for Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups ("ENGOT") and The GOG Foundation, Inc. ("GOG"), third-party clinical study networks, are collaborating with us on the study.
Pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers and is the third most frequent cause of death from cancer in the U.S. While overall cancer incidence and death rates are remaining stable or declining, the incidence and death rates for pancreatic cancer are increasing. It is estimated that approximately 53,000 patients are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer each year in the U.S. Pancreatic cancer has a five-year relative survival rate of just 10 percent.
Physicians use different combinations of surgery, radiation and pharmacological therapies to treat pancreatic cancer, depending on the stage of the disease. For patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer involving encasement of arteries but no extra-pancreatic disease, the standard of care is surgery followed by chemotherapy with or without radiation. Unfortunately, the majority of locally advanced cases are diagnosed once the cancer is no longer operable, generally leaving chemotherapy with or without radiation as the only treatment option.
PANOVA phase 2 pilot study
In 2018, we published the results of our phase 2 pilot study in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the PANOVA study ("PANOVA"), examining TTFields in combination with standard of care chemotherapy.
PANOVA was a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label study. The study included 40 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer whose tumors could not be removed surgically and who had not received chemotherapy or radiation therapy prior to the clinical study. Patients were enrolled between 2014 and 2016 in two cohorts: The first cohort of 20 patients received TTFields with standard doses of gemcitabine alone. The second cohort of 20 patients received TTFields with standard doses of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine.
In the first cohort, efficacy results showed that progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with TTFields combined with gemcitabine were more than double those of gemcitabine-treated historical controls. Median progression-free survival in the TTFields-treated group was 8.3 months (compared to 3.7 months in the gemcitabine historical control), with locally advanced patients reaching a median progression-free survival of 10.3 months and patients with metastatic disease reaching a median progression-free survival of 5.7 months. The median overall survival for all patients was 14.9 months (compared to 6.7 months in the gemcitabine historical control). Median overall survival was not reached in locally advanced patients and 86% of patients were alive at end of follow up. Patients with metastatic disease experienced a median overall survival of 8.3 months. One-year 
survival was 55% (compared to 22% in the gemcitabine historical control). Of 11 patients with available CT scans, 5 (45%) had a partial response (compared to 7% with gemcitabine alone), 5 (45%) had stable disease, which means that the cancer is neither decreasing nor increasing in extent or severity, and 1 (10%) had progressive disease.
In the second cohort, efficacy results showed that progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with TTFields combined with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine were more than double those of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine-treated historical controls. Median progression-free survival in the TTFields-treated group was 12.7 months (compared to 5.5 months in the nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine historical control) and median overall survival was not yet reached. The one-year survival rate was 72% (compared to 35% in nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine historical control). Of the 15 patients with available CT scans, 6 (40%) had a partial response (compared to 23% with the nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine alone), 7 (47%) had stable disease and 2 (13%) had progressive disease.
Safety results from both cohorts suggested that TTFields plus first-line chemotherapies nab-paclitaxel and/or gemcitabine may be tolerable and safe in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients reported no serious adverse events related to TTFields.
PANOVA-3 phase 3 pivotal study
In 2018, we enrolled the first patient in our PANOVA-3 study ("PANOVA-3"), a phase 3 pivotal study testing the effectiveness of TTFields with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine versus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine alone as a front-line treatment for unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer. It is estimated that approximately 43,000 patients are diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer each year in the U.S. The primary endpoint of PANOVA-3 is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, local progression-free survival, objective response rate, one-year survival rate, quality of life, pain-free survival, resectability rate and toxicity.
The study is designed to accrue 556 patients with data analyzed 18 months after the last patient in. A DMC will conduct a pre-specified interim analysis pursuant to the study protocol and final data is anticipated in 2024.
Zai License and Collaboration Agreement
In 2018, we announced a strategic collaboration with Zai. The collaboration agreement grants Zai a license to commercialize our Products in Greater China and establishes a development partnership intended to accelerate the development of TTFields in multiple solid tumor cancer indications. Zai has launched Optune for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM in Hong Kong and mainland China and is seeking marketing authorization for GBM in Taiwan. Zai has also launched Optune Lua for the treatment of MPM in Hong Kong and has filed a Marketing Authorization Application for MPM in mainland China. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Manufacturing and supply chain
We outsource production of all of our system components to qualified partners. Disposable array manufacturing, the dominant activity in our manufacturing supply chain, includes several specialized processes. Production of the durable system components follows standard electronic medical device methodologies.
We have supply agreements in place with our third-party manufacturing partners. While we currently obtain some critical materials for use in certain jurisdictions from single source suppliers, we have developed or are in the process of developing and obtaining regulatory approval for second sources for critical materials in all jurisdictions. We hold safety stocks of single source components in quantities that we believe are sufficient to protect against possible supply chain disruptions. We anticipate that the diversification of our supply chain will both ensure a continuity of supply and reduce costs.
Intellectual property
We believe we possess global commercialization rights to our Products in oncology and are well-positioned to extend those rights into the future as we continue to find innovative ways to improve our Products. Our robust global patent and intellectual property portfolio consists of hundreds of issued patents in multiple jurisdictions covering various aspects of our devices and related technology. In the U.S., our patents have expected expiration dates between 2023 and 2038. We have also filed several hundred additional patent applications worldwide, that, if issued, may protect aspects of our platform beyond the current last-to-expire patent in the relevant market. These 
pending applications cover innovations relating to our arrays, field generators and software platform, in addition to other topics related to TTFields. Our reliance on intellectual property involves certain risks, as described under the heading "Risk factors—Risks relating to intellectual property."
In addition to our patent portfolio, we further protect our intellectual property by maintaining the confidentiality of our trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information. Given the length of time and expense associated with bringing device candidates through development and regulatory approval to the market place, the healthcare industry has traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining patent protection and maintaining trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information for significant new technologies, products and processes.
Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. These agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements also generally provide that we own, or the individual is required to assign to us, all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may copy certain aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we believe is proprietary.
Pursuant to our strategic collaboration with Zai, we granted Zai a license to commercialize TTFields in Greater China. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Technion Research and Development Foundation to resolve certain potential disputes regarding intellectual property developed by our founder and previously assigned to us.
In 2005, we granted an exclusive license to a third party, NovoBiotic LLC, to certain of our key intellectual property for use outside the field of oncology. In December 2020, we entered into an agreement with Novobiotic LLC that terminated all pre-existing agreements between the parties, including any restrictions on our use of intellectual property outside the field of oncology.
Competition
The market for cancer treatments is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and treatment introductions and other activities of industry participants. The general bases of competition are overall effectiveness, side effect profile, cost, availability of reimbursement and general market acceptance of a product as a suitable cancer treatment.
Our intellectual property portfolio is continuously expanding as we find new and unique ways to improve TTFields therapy. We believe these intellectual property rights would provide an obstacle to the introduction of state of the art TTFields devices by a competitor. However, competitors may be able to offer less sophisticated TTFields devices that utilize technology described in expired patents and/or choose to market their system(s) in countries where we have limited or no enforceable intellectual property rights. Competitors could also pursue alternative technologies for the application of TTFields into a patient that we did not foresee or protect. We are aware of a few third parties in the United States and China developing devices and filing for intellectual property protection related to TTFields.
Beginning in 2021, several of our early patents covering technology included in our Products began expiring in the U.S. and elsewhere. Even after the expiration of our patents, we believe that potential market entrants applying low-intensity, alternating electric fields to solid tumors will have to undertake their own clinical studies and regulatory submissions to prove equivalence to our Products, a necessary step in receiving regulatory approvals for a competing product, all while avoiding infringing our unexpired patents.
Presently, the traditional biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical technology industries expend significant resources in developing novel and proprietary therapies for the treatment of solid tumors, including GBM, MPM and other indications that we are currently investigating. As we work to increase market acceptance of our Products, we compete with companies commercializing or investigating other anti-cancer therapies, some of which are in clinical studies for GBM or MPM that currently specifically exclude patients who have been or are being treated with our Products. The introduction of competing therapies could materially impact our business and financial results. 
Government regulation
In the U.S., our Products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"). In the EU member states where we market our Products and operate, we are currently subject to, inter alia, the Medical Device Directive ("MDD") as implemented into national legislation by the EU member states. On May 26, 2021, the MDD was replaced and repealed by the Medical Device Regulation ("MDR"), which applies directly in all EU member states. In Switzerland, our Products and operations are subject to, inter alia, the Medical Devices Ordinance, which implements the MDD into Swiss law (See "Foreign approvals and CE mark" below). In Japan, our Products and operations are subject to regulation by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency ("PMDA") under the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act ("PMD Act"). In addition, our Products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of national, regional and international standards that govern the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, certification, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, export and marketing and distribution, among other things, of our Products for current and future indications.
In the U.S., advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, is also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. In the EU, advertising and promotion is subject to not only the general provisions of the MDD or MDR, but also general EU advertising rules on misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as implemented at the EU member state level, such as the Heilmittelwerbegesetz in Germany. Promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of government enforcement actions brought under healthcare laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, we are required to meet analogous regulatory requirements in countries outside the U.S., which can change rapidly with relatively short notice. Competitors can also initiate litigation alleging false advertising for our promotional efforts under the Lanham Act, or under similar state laws. 
Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are also subject to extensive regulation.
Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in any number of regulatory enforcement actions, or civil or criminal liability.
Food and Drug Administration
The FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, marketing, distribution and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. to international markets and the importation of medical devices manufactured abroad. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers to ensure compliance with the FDCA.
The FDA governs the following activities that we perform or that are performed on our behalf:
•product design, development and manufacture;
•product safety, testing, labeling and storage;
•record keeping procedures;
•product marketing, sales and distribution; and
•post-marketing surveillance, complaint handling, medical device reporting, reporting of deaths, serious injuries or device malfunctions and repair or recall of products.
We have registered three of our facilities with the FDA. We are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the Quality System Regulation ("QSR") and other regulations and these inspections include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers.
FDA’s premarket clearance and approval requirements
Unless an exemption applies, before we can commercially distribute medical devices in the U.S., we must obtain, depending on the type of device, either prior 510(k) clearance or premarket approval ("PMA") from the FDA. The 
FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either class I or II, which typically requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Some low-risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in class III, generally requiring PMA.
Premarket approval (PMA) and Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) pathways
Optune and Optune Lua are classified as Class III devices as they are deemed to be life-sustaining devices. Accordingly, we were required to receive PMA for Optune, which the FDA granted in April 2011 and October 2015 for the treatment of recurrent and newly diagnosed supratentorial GBM, respectively, in adult patients. We expect that we will be required to receive PMA for the use of our Products for future indications.
A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including from technical tests, preclinical studies and clinical studies, manufacturing information and intended labeling to demonstrate, to the FDA’s satisfaction, the safety and effectiveness of a medical device for its intended use. During the PMA review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. Prior to approval of the Optune PMA for the treatment of recurrent GBM, we and our critical component suppliers were each inspected by the FDA.
New PMAs or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of our devices, including, for example, certain types of modifications to a device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require any or as extensive clinical data as the original PMA required, or the convening of an advisory panel. The FDA requires a company to make the determination as to whether a new PMA or PMA supplement application is to be filed. If a company determines that neither a new PMA nor a PMA supplement application is required for modifications, it must nevertheless notify the FDA of these modifications in its PMA Annual Report. The FDA may review a company’s decisions when reviewing the PMA Annual Report and require the filing of an application.
As is typical with medical device companies, we have received approval for a number of post-approval PMA supplements for GBM, including for modifications to Optune’s electric field generator, arrays, software, manufacturing processes and labeling. Future modifications may be considered by us as the need arises, some of which we may deem to require a PMA supplement application and others to require reporting in our PMA Annual Report.
For class III devices intended to treat disease affecting 8,000 individuals or less per year in the U.S., called Humanitarian Use Devices ("HUD"), the FDA has a separate marketing authorization pathway called the HDE. Approval basis for an HDE is a "reasonable assurance of safety" and that the probable benefit to health outweighs risk of injury from its use, which means a traditional phase 3 pivotal study usually is not required to support approval. 
In 2019, the FDA approved Optune Lua (then known as "NovoTTF-100L") for the treatment of MPM under the HDE pathway. Devices approved through an HDE application are subject to certain requirements, including specific labeling restrictions and the requirement that a facility’s institutional review board ("IRB") or Local Committee approve the use of the device before it can be distributed in that facility. In addition, there is a general prohibition on profiting from sales of devices approved under the HDE standard. As part of the approval process, we applied for an exemption from this limitation, which the FDA granted. Otherwise, HDE approved devices are generally required to follow the same requirements as PMA approved devices, including the supplement process. 
Clinical studies
Clinical studies are generally required to support approval of a PMA or HDE. Such studies generally require an Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") approval from the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical studies are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical studies must be 
conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical study sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including those relating to current Good Clinical Practices ("cGCPs"). To conduct a clinical study, we also are required to obtain the patients’ informed consent in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. We, the FDA or the respective IRB could suspend a clinical study at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a study is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the U.S.
Post-approval studies are also typically required as a condition of PMA to reinforce the reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Such studies are conducted in the post-market setting with the approved device, often to address the long-term use of the device or other discrete questions that may have been raised based on the clinical data from the IDE clinical study. The FDA required a post-approval registry study as a condition of approval for Optune for recurrent GBM,which we completed.
Foreign approvals and CE mark
Market access, sales and marketing of medical devices outside of the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), for Novocure’s devices these include the requirement to obtain a CE Certificate and to affix a CE mark to our Products. In the EEA, whether or not we have obtained FDA approval, our devices must be subject to conformity assessment procedure involving an EEA notified body, a private organization accredited by an EEA member state to conduct conformity assessment procedures under the MDD/MDR. Apart from low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. The notified body typically audits and examines the device’s technical documentation, including the clinical evaluation, and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a CE Certificate demonstrating compliance with the relevant requirements or the quality system requirements laid down in the relevant Annexes to the MDD/MDR. Following the issuance of this CE Certificate, we can draw up a declaration of conformity and affix the CE mark to the devices covered by this CE Certificate. The time required to CE mark our devices or to obtain approval from other non-U.S. authorities may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Moreover, the MDR, which became applicable on May 26, 2021, imposed new, stricter requirements that we must comply with in order to renew the CE Certificates for our Products when these expire, or May 25, 2025, whichever comes first. In addition, as of May 25, 2021, in the absence of a new MRA, Switzerland is now considered a non-EU “third country” with respect to medical devices, meaning that movement of our Products bearing a CE mark from the EEA to Switzerland is subject to additional requirements. 
In the EEA, before carrying out a clinical investigation with a non-CE marked device to assess its safety or performance when in accordance with its intended use, the study sponsor must receive a positive opinion from the local ethics committee and approval from the national competent authority in the relevant EEA member states in which the clinical investigation will be conducted. When a CE marked medical device is used in a clinical study in accordance with its intended use, the approval of the national competent authorities is not required for the use of such medical device in the study. In Japan, we must obtain approvals from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare ("MHLW") to market our devices. Each regulatory approval process outside of the U.S. includes all the risks associated with FDA regulation, as well as country-specific regulations.
Pervasive and continuing regulation
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply depending upon the country in which the device is being marketed. These may include:
•product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
•QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process for products marketed in the U.S.;
•labeling regulations and FDA and equivalent competent authority in other jurisdictions requiring promotion be truthful and non-misleading and prohibiting the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;
•approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our devices that has been approved or is the subject of a CE Certificate;
•Medical Device Reporting regulations of the FDCA and medical device vigilance, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA or equivalent competent authority requirements in other jurisdictions to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
•post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;
•the FDA’s and equivalent competent authority’s recall authority, whereby they can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations;
•regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and
•notices of corrections or removals.
Our devices could be subject to voluntary recall if we, the FDA or another applicable regulatory authority determine, for any reason, that our devices pose a risk of injury or are otherwise defective. Moreover, the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities can order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that our device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death.
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations and these inspections include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. We are also subject to FDA’s broad regulatory enforcement power around promotional activities. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions, including, but not limited to:
•untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;
•customer notifications for repair, replacement and/or refunds;
•recall, detention or seizure of our devices;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing or delaying our requests for approval of device candidates or a modified version of Optune;
•withdrawal of PMA/HDE approvals or suspension, variation or withdrawal of CE Certificates that have already been granted;
•refusal to grant export approval for our devices; or
•civil and/or criminal prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice or other enforcement authorities outside of the U.S.
To date, our facility and those of our critical suppliers have been inspected by the FDA in order to obtain FDA approval of our Products. No inspectional observations were identified and no FDA Form 483s were issued following these inspections.
DME accreditation and licensing and other requirements
In the U.S., we are subject to accreditation and licensing requirements as a DME supplier in most states and must meet the supplier standards of Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Certain states require that DME providers maintain an in-state location. Although we believe we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations regarding accreditation and licensure requirements and similar requirements in other jurisdictions, if we are found to be noncompliant, we could lose our accreditation or licensure in such states or our supplier rights under such federal healthcare programs, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future devices to patients in such state or to that federal healthcare program.
Healthcare regulatory matters
In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of medical devices, several other U.S. federal and state laws have been applied to restrict certain business practices in the healthcare industry and penalize unlawful conduct. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal prohibition on physician self-referrals (commonly known as the "Stark Law") and the federal False Claims Act.
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal, intent-based statute that prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any healthcare item or service that may be paid for, in whole or in part, by Medicare, Medicaid or another federal healthcare program. Among other arrangements, this statute has been interpreted to apply to financial arrangements between medical device manufacturers on one hand and prescribers and purchasers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain common activities from prosecution under the law, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve the provision of remuneration intended to induce ordering, purchasing, leasing or recommending of a medical device may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. In some cases, our practices may not meet all of the technical elements for protection under a federal Anti-Kickback Statute exception or safe harbor. Similarly, as a supplier, we are also subject to the federal beneficiary anti-inducement statute, which prohibits us from offering any remuneration to a beneficiary of Medicare or Medicaid that is likely to influence that beneficiary’s choice of therapy, unless an exception applies. This can include, but is not limited to, the provision of inappropriate financial assistance to purchase our Products. Recent government investigations and enforcement actions have focused on the provision of financial assistance to patients by providers and suppliers. As noted, there are established exceptions from liability, but we cannot guarantee that all of our practices will fall squarely within those exceptions.
As a DME supplier, we also are subject to the Stark law, which is a strict liability law that prohibits Medicare payments for certain "designated health services" ("DHS") including DME ordered by physicians who, personally or through an immediate family member, have an ownership interest in or a compensation arrangement with the furnishing DHS entity. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions that, if met, permit physicians who have certain financial relationships with a DHS entity to make referrals to that entity and for that entity to bill Medicare for such services.
The False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. The government has pursued numerous cases under the False Claims Act in connection with the off-label promotion of medical products and various other health care law violations. Notably, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law and False Claims Act laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, that apply regardless of the payer (e.g., including private/commercial payors or cash-pay scenarios).
Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH" and collectively "HIPAA"), govern the collection, dissemination, use, security and privacy of individually identifiable health information. We believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA.
HIPAA also includes a number of federal criminal provisions, including for healthcare fraud and for false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud provision prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme 
to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements provision prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Many states have similar healthcare fraud laws or insurance fraud laws that apply to claims for healthcare reimbursement.
Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.
Legislation similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law and False Claims Act has been adopted in foreign countries, including a number of EU member states.
In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") has applied since May 25, 2018. The GDPR harmonizes data privacy laws and rules for the processing of personal data, including patient and employee data, across the EU and repeals and replaces Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 24, 1995, and applicable national laws. The GDPR has added a number of strict data protection and security requirements for companies processing personal data of EU residents, including when such data is transferred outside the EU.
In the U.S., the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act ("Sunshine Act") requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals or medical supplies that participate in U.S. federal health care programs to track and then report certain payments and transfers of value given to "Covered Recipients." The term "Covered Recipients" currently includes U.S.-licensed physicians and teaching hospitals, and, for reports submitted on or after January 1, 2022, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. The Sunshine Act requires that manufacturers collect this information on a yearly basis and then report it to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by the 90th day of each subsequent year. We have adopted policies and codes of conduct regarding our interactions with Covered Recipients and believe we are in material compliance with the Sunshine Act. However, our failure to adhere to these requirements could materially adversely impact our business and financial results. Additionally, a number of states have transparency reporting requirements similar to (and in some cases broader than) the Sunshine Act, and regulations similar to the Sunshine Act have been adopted in foreign countries including a number of EU member states.
In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business outside the U.S. or to influence a person working in an official capacity in a foreign country. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity. Legislation similar to the FCPA has been adopted in foreign countries, including a number of EU member states.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,167 employees, compared to 1,023 employees as of December 31, 2020. We believe relations with our employees are good.
To achieve commercial success for our Products, we believe we must continue to develop and grow our sales and marketing, patient support and research and development teams, along with the necessary staff to support it. This need accounts for the significant increase in the number of employees in 2021. Developing and managing a growing organization is a difficult, expensive and time consuming process. To be successful we must:
•recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective and experienced sales and marketing, patient support and research and development personnel;
•effectively train our personnel on the benefits and risks of our Products and healthcare compliance; and
•manage geographically disbursed business operations.
We compete with other medical device, pharmaceutical and life sciences companies to recruit, hire, train and retain the personnel that we anticipate we will need. Because our current Products require, and we anticipate our future Products will require, physician training and education, we expect that our sales and marketing and patient support teams will continue to grow substantially as we expand our approved indications and markets. 
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic also creates challenges to our ability to recruit and retain effective and experienced employees. In 2021, we instituted a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all employees (subject to certain exceptions). Some employees chose to leave our company in response to this mandate and while the pandemic continues, this mandate may limit our ability to recruit new employees.
