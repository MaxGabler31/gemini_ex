Description of Business
Visteon Corporation (the "Company" or "Visteon") is a global automotive supplier that designs, engineers and manufactures innovative electronics products for nearly every original equipment vehicle manufacturer ("OEM") worldwide including Ford, Mazda, Renault/Nissan, General Motors, Jaguar/Land Rover, Honda, Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler. Visteon is headquartered in Van Buren Township, Michigan, and has an international network of manufacturing operations, technical centers and joint venture operations, supported by approximately 10,000 employees, dedicated to the design, development, manufacture and support of its product offerings and its global customers. The Company's manufacturing and engineering footprint is principally located outside of the U.S., with a heavy concentration in low-cost geographic regions. 
Visteon provides value for its customers and stockholders through its technology-focused vehicle cockpit electronics business, by delivering a rich, connected cockpit experience for every car from luxury to entry. The Company's cockpit electronics business is one of the broadest portfolios in the industry and includes instrument clusters, information displays, infotainment systems, audio systems, telematics solutions, and head-up displays. The Company's vehicle cockpit electronics business comprises and is reported under the Electronics segment. In addition to the Electronics segment, the Company had residual operations in South America and Europe previously associated with the Interiors and Climate businesses, sold or exited by December 31, 2016, but not subject to discontinued operations classification that comprised Other.
The Company’s History
The Company was incorporated in Delaware in January 2000 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company (“Ford” or “Ford Motor Company”). Subsequently, Ford transferred the assets and liabilities comprising its automotive components and systems business to Visteon. The Company separated from Ford in June 2000 when all of the Company’s common stock was distributed by Ford to its shareholders. After filing for bankruptcy in 2009 as a result of the recession, the Company emerged from bankruptcy in 2010, and in 2012 implemented a comprehensive shareholder value creation plan that involved the transformation milestones below. 
Transformation Milestones
The Company previously operated Climate, Interiors, and Electronics product lines. Over the last five years, the Company has transformed the business operations into a pure-play supplier of automotive cockpit electronics and connected car solutions. 
A summary of the milestones completing the transformation are summarized below:

• | Exit of Climate Business - On June 9, 2015, Visteon Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, VIHI, LLC (collectively, “Visteon”) completed the sale of its shares of Halla Visteon Climate Control Corporation, a Korean corporation (“HVCC”) (the “Climate Transaction”). The Company received net cash proceeds of approximately $2.7 billion and recognized a pretax gain of approximately $2.3 billion in connection with the closing of the Climate Transaction in the second quarter of 2015.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company sold its South Africa climate operations with 2015 annual sales of $9 million for proceeds of $2 million, and recorded a loss of $11 million related to foreign currency translation amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
In connection with the Climate Transaction, the Company completed the repurchase of the electronics operations located in India during the first quarter of 2017 for $47 million, recognizing a $7 million gain on the settlement of purchase commitment contingencies. 

• | Exit of Interiors Business - During 2014, the Company divested the majority of its global Interiors business (the "Interiors Divestiture"). Subsequently, Visteon completed the sale of its Interiors operations in Thailand on February 2, 2015. On December 1, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Interiors operations in Argentina and Brazil, incurring a loss of $19 million representing the final working capital cash contribution and related contractual obligations, marking the completion of the Interiors Divestiture. 

3

On December 1, 2015, Visteon completed the sale and transfer of its equity ownership in Visteon Deutschland GmbH, which operated the Berlin, Germany interiors plant ("Germany Interiors Divestiture"). The Company contributed cash of approximately $141 million, assets of $27 million, and liabilities of $198 million including pension related liabilities. The Company made a final contribution payment of approximately $35 million during December 2017 upon the fulfillment of certain buyer contractual commitments, that had been included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as "Other current liabilities" as of December 31, 2016. 

• | Enhance Shareholder Returns - In connection with the Climate Transaction, the Company returned approximately $2.75 billion of cash to shareholders from 2015 through 2016 via a series of actions including share buybacks and special distributions.

During 2015, the Company entered an accelerated stock buyback ("ASB") program for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million. Under this program the Company repurchased 4,771,262 shares of common stock for an average settlement price of $104.79.

On December 9, 2015, the Company declared a special distribution of $43.40 per share of its common stock outstanding as of January 15, 2016, or approximately $1.75 billion in the aggregate. On January 22, 2016 approximately $1.74 billion was distributed to shareholders. An additional amount of $14 million will be paid upon vesting and settlement of restricted stock units and performance-based share units previously granted to the Company's employees. The special cash distribution was funded from the Climate Transaction proceeds.
During 2016, Visteon entered into stock buyback programs with a third-party financial institution to purchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million. Under these programs, Visteon purchased 7,190,506 shares at an average price of $69.48.
The Company's strategic priorities going forward are outlined in Item 7 "Executive Summary" of this Report. 
The Company’s Industry
The Company operates in the automotive industry, which is cyclical and highly sensitive to general economic conditions. The Company believes that future success in the automotive industry is, in part, dependent on alignment with customers to support their efforts to effectively meet the challenges associated with the following significant trends and developments in the global automotive industry.

• | Electronic content and connectivity - The electronic content of vehicles continues to increase due to various regulatory requirements and consumer demand for increased vehicle performance and functionality. The use of electronic components can reduce weight, expedite assembly, enhance fuel economy, improve emissions, increase safety and enhance vehicle performance. Additionally, digital and portable technologies have dramatically influenced the lifestyle of today’s consumers, who expect products that enable such a lifestyle. This requires increased electronic and technical content such as in-vehicle communication, navigation and entertainment capabilities. While OEMs are taking different paths to connect their vehicles to high-speed broadband internet connections in the short-term, future vehicles are expected to be built with vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity systems. There is momentum by OEMs to integrate discrete electronic control units into a multi-core domain controller to increase efficiency and reduce power consumption, cost and weight. Vehicle cockpits are becoming increasingly digitized.


• | Advanced driver assistance systems ("ADAS") and autonomous driving - The industry continues to advance toward semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles. The Society of Automotive Engineers has defined five levels of autonomy ranging from levels one and two with driver-assist functions whereby the driver is responsible for monitoring the environment, to level five with full autonomy under all conditions. Levels one and two are already popular in the market while levels three and above require multiple sensors, radars, camera and LiDARs, requiring sensor fusion and machine learning technologies, as the system assumes the role of monitoring the environment. Level three includes features such as highway pilot and parking assist technology, for which a high market penetration rate is expected over the next several years. 


• | Safety and security - Governments continue to focus regulatory efforts on safer transportation. Accordingly, OEMs are working to improve occupant and pedestrian safety by incorporating more safety-oriented technology in their vehicles. Additionally, in-vehicle connectivity has increased the need for robust cybersecurity systems to protect data, applications and associated infrastructure. Security features are evolving with advances in sensors and silicon. Suppliers must enable the security/safety initiatives of their customers including the development of new technologies.

4


• | Vehicle standardization - OEMs continue to standardize vehicle platforms on a global basis, resulting in a lower number of individual vehicle platforms, design cost savings and further scale of economies through the production of a greater number of models from each platform. Having operations in the geographic markets in which OEMs produce global platforms enables suppliers to meet OEMs’ needs more economically and efficiently, thus making global coverage a source of significant competitive advantage for suppliers with a diversified global footprint. Additionally, OEMs are looking to suppliers for increased collaboration to lower costs, reduce risks and decrease overall time to market. Suppliers that can provide fully engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing. As vehicles become more connected and cockpits more digitized, suppliers that can deliver modular hardware architectures, “open” software architectures and a software platform approach will be poised to help OEMs achieve greater reuse of validated hardware circuitry, design scalability and faster development cycles.

The Company’s Customers
The Company's ultimate customers are global vehicle manufacturers including Ford, Mazda, Renault/Nissan, General Motors, Jaguar / Land Rover, Honda, Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler. Ford, Mazda and Renault/Nissan are the Company's largest customers and in 2017 accounted for sales of approximately 28%, 17% and 14%, respectively. In 2016 and 2015, Ford accounted for 30% and 34% of sales, respectively, Mazda accounted for 17% and 16% of sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively and Renault/Nissan accounted for 15% and 14% of sales for 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
The Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery occurs, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Price reductions are typically negotiated on an annual basis between suppliers and OEMs. Such reductions are intended to take into account expected annual reductions in the overall cost to the supplier of providing products and services to the customer, through such factors as manufacturing productivity enhancements, material cost-reductions and design-related cost improvements. The Company has an aggressive cost-reduction program that focuses on reducing its total costs, which are intended to offset customer price reductions. However, there can be no assurance that the Company’s cost-reduction efforts will be sufficient to fully offset such price reductions. The Company records price reductions when probable and reasonably estimable.

The Company’s Competition
The automotive sector is concentrated, but operates under highly competitive conditions resulting from the globalized nature of the industry, high fixed costs and the resulting need for scale economies, market dynamics including share in mature economies and positioning in emerging economies, and the low cost of switching for the end consumer. Accordingly, OEMs rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of financial viability, product quality, price competitiveness, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design and manufacturing capability and flexibility, customer service and overall management. The Company's primary independent competitors include but are not limited to Alpine Electronics, Aptiv PLC, Continental AG, Denso Corporation, Harman International, LG Corporation, Nippon Seiki, Panasonic Corporation, Pioneer Corporation, and Robert Bosch GmbH.
The Company’s Product Sales Backlog
The Company defines backlog as cumulative remaining awarded life-of-program expected booked sales, to be delivered in future periods. The Company’s Electronics segment backlog was $19.4 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared with $16.5 billion as of December 31, 2016, reflecting an increase of 18%. The Company’s estimated net sales may be impacted by various assumptions, including new program vehicle production levels, customer price reductions, currency exchange rates and program launch timing. In addition, the Company typically enters into customer agreements at the beginning of a vehicle life cycle with the intent to fulfill purchasing requirements for the entire vehicle production life cycle. These agreements may be terminated by customers at any time and, accordingly, expected net sales information does not represent firm orders or firm commitments.
The Company’s Business is Seasonal and Cyclical
Historically, the Company’s business has been moderately seasonal because its largest North American customers typically cease production for approximately two weeks in July for model year changeovers and approximately one week in December during the winter holidays. Customers in Europe historically shut down vehicle production during a portion of August and one week in December. In China, customers typically shut down approximately one week in early October and one week in January or February.  Additionally, third-quarter automotive production traditionally is lower as new vehicle models enter production.
The Company’s Workforce and Employee Relations
The Company’s workforce as of December 31, 2017 included approximately 10,000 persons, of which approximately 5,000 were salaried employees and 5,000 were hourly workers. Many of the Company’s employees are members of industrial trade unions and confederations within their respective countries, including Europe, Asia and South America. Many of these organizations operate under collectively bargained contracts that are not specific to any one employer. The Company constantly works to establish and maintain positive, cooperative relations with its unions and work representatives around the world and believes that its relationships with unionized employees are satisfactory. 
The Company’s Product Research and Development
The Company’s research and development efforts are intended to maintain leadership positions in core products and provide the Company with a competitive edge as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers. The Company also works with technology development partners, including customers, to develop technological capabilities and new products and applications. Total research and development expenses, net of recoveries, were approximately $253 million, $295 million and $294 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company’s Intellectual Property
The Company owns significant intellectual property, including a number of patents, copyrights, proprietary tools and technologies and trade secrets and is involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Although the Company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining its competitive position, no single patent, copyright, proprietary tool or technology, trade secret or license, or group of related patents, copyrights, proprietary tools or technologies, trade secrets or licenses is, in the opinion of management, of such value to the Company that its business would be materially affected by the expiration or termination thereof. The Company’s general policy is to apply for patents on an ongoing basis, in appropriate countries, on its patentable developments that are considered to have commercial significance.
The Company also views its name and mark as significant to its business as a whole. In addition, the Company holds rights in a number of other trade names and marks applicable to certain of its businesses and products that it views as important to such businesses and products.
7

The Company’s Raw Materials and Suppliers
Raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of its products include electronics components, resins, copper, and precious metals. All of the materials used are generally available from numerous sources. In general, the Company does not carry inventories of raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had not experienced significant shortages of raw materials. The Company monitors its supply base and endeavors to work with suppliers and customers to attempt to mitigate the impact of potential material shortages and supply disruptions. While the Company does not anticipate any significant interruption in the supply of raw materials, there can be no assurance that sufficient sources or amounts of all necessary raw materials will be available in the future. 

The automotive supply industry is subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials, which have historically placed operational and financial burdens on the entire supply chain. Accordingly, the Company continues to take actions with its customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with customers include collaboration on alternative product designs and material specifications, contractual price escalation clauses and negotiated customer recoveries. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with suppliers include aggregation of purchase requirements to achieve optimal volume benefits, negotiation of cost-reductions and identification of more cost competitive suppliers. While these actions are designed to offset the impact of inflationary pressures, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will be successful in fully offsetting increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures.
