ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Prothena Corporation plc (“Prothena” or the “Company”) is a global, late-stage clinical biotechnology company establishing fully-integrated research, development and commercial capabilities and focused on advancing new therapies in the neuroscience and orphan disease categories. Fueled by its deep scientific understanding built over decades of research in protein misfolding, Prothena seeks to fundamentally change the course of grave or currently untreatable diseases associated with this biology.
Our pipeline of antibody-based product candidates targets a number of potential indications including AL amyloidosis (NEOD001), Parkinson’s disease and other related synucleinopathies (PRX002/RG7935) and ATTR amyloidosis (PRX004). The Company continues to advance additional discovery programs where our deep scientific understanding of disease pathology can be leveraged. We have a number of discovery-stage programs targeting proteins implicated in diseases across the neuroscience and orphan categories, including tau and Aβ (Amyloid beta) for the potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders and ALECT2 for the potential treatment of ALECT2 amyloidosis.
We were formed on September 26, 2012 under the laws of Ireland and re-registered as an Irish public limited company on October 25, 2012. Our ordinary shares began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “PRTA” on December 21, 2012 and currently trade on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.
Our Strategy 
Our goal is to be a leading biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of diseases in the neuroscience and orphan categories. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:

• | Concentrate our discovery and development efforts in areas where we have decades of scientific expertise and experience.

We leverage our core scientific expertise and proprietary technology to develop innovative therapeutics for the potential treatment of diseases with major unmet medical needs in the neuroscience and orphan categories. Our scientists are primarily focused on the biology of diseases caused by protein misfolding and our approach leverages the unique insights derived from our decades of research and development in this area. Our approach to advancing new compounds from discovery through clinical development is based on a deep understanding of how to optimally target proteins, assess target engagement and disease progression and develop antibodies that relevantly influence biology. Once we formulate a novel hypothesis or approach to a known target, we generate antibodies against that target. Specific and selective antibodies are characterized in vitro, then used to test the initial hypothesis in vivo using animal models of disease. We sometimes rely on the use of animal models that have been extensively developed by external laboratories. To establish early clinical proof of concept for our programs, we leverage our insight of disease pathology and, when possible, employ biomarker endpoints as a way to detect signals of biological activity. We may elect to start clinical testing of our antibodies in indications that have well-established endpoints in order to demonstrate proof of concept as a basis for further investment in clinical trials, either by us or potential partners.
•Focus on diseases that lack effective therapies.
We focus on the development and commercialization of therapies for serious and/or life-threatening diseases that currently lack effective therapies or in areas where current therapies have known limitations. Our efforts in AL amyloidosis, Parkinson’s disease, and other diseases where misfolded proteins are implicated in pathogenesis are examples of this. In AL amyloidosis, misfolded proteins aggregate and form amyloid, which can accumulate in vital organs, disrupt their normal function and cause death. Today, there are no approved treatments that directly target and clear amyloid that builds up in organs. NEOD001 is intended to neutralize and clear disease-causing amyloid in AL amyloidosis and is the first immunotherapy directly targeting light chain amyloid to receive Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”).
Similarly, in Parkinson’s disease, currently approved therapies focus on the alleviation of symptoms without addressing the underlying cause of the disease. Prothena is focusing its efforts to develop a therapeutic with the potential to slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease by targeting the α-synuclein protein. Synucleins are a family of proteins, of which there are three known members: α-synuclein, β-synuclein, and γ-synuclein. The α- and β-synuclein proteins are found primarily in brain tissue. There is genetic evidence that α-synuclein plays a fundamental role in Parkinson’s disease, and an increasing body of evidence 
1

demonstrates that pathogenic forms of α-synuclein can be propagated and transmitted from neuron to neuron. Prothena’s scientists have generated PRX002/RG7935 - a monoclonal antibody targeting the pathogenic aggregated form of α-synuclein that is designed to slow or reduce the neurodegeneration associated with α-synuclein misfolding and/or its transmission. We are developing PRX002/RG7935 in collaboration with Roche for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other related synucleinopathies.
Moving forward, we intend to advance new discovery-stage monoclonal antibody therapeutics with first-in-class or best-in-class potential, and our discovery efforts targeting tau, Aβ and ALECT2 are examples of this.
•Strategically partner, collaborate and leverage external resources.
We rely on strategic collaborations and a combination of internal and external resources to advance our objectives.
Our robust discovery engine generates monoclonal antibodies that may be useful in treating unmet medical needs. For investigational therapeutic antibody programs targeting broad patient populations that may require large clinical trials and development investment, we may seek to collaborate or license these programs to biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies for development and/or commercialization. Our collaboration with Roche to develop PRX002/RG7935 for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other related synucleinopathies is a good example of this.
We also collaborate with scientific and clinical experts in disease areas of interest to test and characterize our potential therapeutic antibody candidates and to gain feedback and guidance on our programs.
Although we rely on, and will expand as appropriate, strong internal talent with expertise in our core areas of focus, we also rely on external resources, as needed, to execute efficiently on our clinical development and other business objectives. We engage consultants who have certain functional and/or disease area expertise to help us execute specific activities related to our programs.
•Pursue commercialization strategies to maximize the value of our product candidates or future potential products.
As we move our drug candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we will evaluate several strategic options for commercialization. These options include building our own internal sales force; forging partnerships with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, whereby we jointly sell and market the product; regional licensing for markets where we do not have expertise or infrastructure; and out-licensing our product, whereby another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company sells and markets our product and pays us a royalty on sales. We evaluate options for each product based on a number of factors including commercial synergies and expertise, capital necessary to execute on each option, size of the market to be addressed and the expertise and terms of potential offers from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
Research and Development Pipeline
Our research and development pipeline includes two therapeutic antibody programs in clinical development: NEOD001 for the potential treatment of AL amyloidosis; and PRX002/RG7935, in collaboration with Roche, for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other related synucleinopathies. PRX004, our program for the potential treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, is in late stage preclinical development.
In addition to our development pipeline, we have a number of discovery-stage programs targeting proteins in the neuroscience and orphan disease categories, including tau and Aβ for the potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders and ALECT2 for the potential treatment of ALECT2 amyloidosis.

The following table summarizes the status of our research and development pipeline:
Our Programs
NEOD001 for the Potential Treatment of AL Amyloidosis
Our most advanced program is NEOD001, an investigational monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the amyloid that accumulates in AL amyloidosis. Systemic amyloidoses, including AL, AA and ATTR amyloidosis, are a complex group of diseases caused by misfolded amyloid proteins that aggregate and deposit in tissue, resulting in progressive organ damage and failure. The most common type, AL amyloidosis, is a rare, progressive and typically fatal disease caused by extracellular deposition of misfolded immunoglobulin light chains. Plasma cells normally produce light chains that pair with heavy chains to make functional antibodies. But in AL amyloidosis, something goes awry - the cause remains unknown - whereby a subset of clonal plasma cells overproduce a single light chain, or fragment thereof, in great abundance. These amyloid light chains (AL) misfold to form toxic soluble and insoluble aggregates that deposit in vital organs such as heart, kidneys, and/or the autonomic or peripheral nerves, causing extensive damage, and potentially organ failure and death. In many cases, patients have multiple organ involvement.
There are no approved treatments for AL amyloidosis and there is a large unmet need for therapies that specifically target soluble toxic aggregates and deposited amyloid fibrils, thereby preserving and improving vital organ function. The Amyloidosis Foundation estimates that approximately 30,000 to 45,000 patients are living with AL amyloidosis in the United States and European Union today. It is estimated that there are approximately 10,000 to 15,000 new cases of AL amyloidosis diagnosed annually in the United States and European Union. The cause of AL amyloidosis remains poorly understood, and we believe this disease is significantly underdiagnosed.
Current treatment for patients with AL amyloidosis may include autologous stem cell transplant or the administration of off-label chemotherapeutic and/or oncologic therapies. The goal of these treatments is to control the hematologic burden by targeting clonal plasma cells in order to decrease the production of new light chain. These chemotherapeutic and/or oncologic agents are associated with known adverse event profiles and patients often become refractory to their hematologic effect and/or relapse. In addition, the target of these therapies is the plasma cells responsible for production of light chain, rather than the toxic light chain in circulation or built up in the organs. Delaying time to organ progression is the goal in the treatment of AL amyloidosis and as such, there remains a significant unmet need to directly target and remove the amyloid deposited on organs.

NEOD001 is a first-in-class antibody that specifically targets the disease-causing, misfolded light chain aggregates in AL amyloidosis. Preclinical testing has demonstrated that NEOD001 reacts only with a “cryptic” epitope that is exposed only in the misfolded form of the light chain. The proposed mechanism of action of NEOD001 is to neutralize circulating soluble aggregates and clear deposited insoluble aggregates from organs. NEOD001 received Fast Track designation from the FDA in December 2014.
The purpose of the Fast Track designation is to make important new drugs available to patients earlier. The Fast Track program also provides a company with the ability to submit sections of the Biologic License Application (“BLA”) for review before the company submits the complete BLA. This enables the FDA to review sections of the BLA as they are received, rather than waiting until every section of the application is completed, and also allows for Priority Review, which can shorten the standard review of the final BLA to six months. A drug program with Fast Track designation permits the company to have early and frequent communications with the FDA in the development and review of the product candidate, potentially leading to faster drug approval.
In addition, NEOD001 was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of AL and AA amyloidosis by the FDA in 2012 and for the treatment of AL amyloidosis by the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) in 2013.
Clinical Development Program for NEOD001
Consistent with a commitment to developing a disease-modifying therapy for patients with AL amyloidosis, Prothena has two ongoing global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies for NEOD001: the PRONTO study (NCT# 02632786, EudraCT# 2015-004318-14) is evaluating NEOD001 in previously-treated patients with AL amyloidosis and persistent cardiac dysfunction, and The VITAL Amyloidosis Study (NCT# 02312206, EudraCT# 2014-003865-11) is evaluating NEOD001 in newly-diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients with AL amyloidosis and cardiac dysfunction.
The VITAL Amyloidosis Study was initiated in December 2014 and is a Phase 3 global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for NEOD001 in patients with AL amyloidosis. The trial is designed to support global regulatory approvals. The original target enrollment of 236 patients was exceeded and 260 newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients with AL amyloidosis and cardiac dysfunction were randomized into the study. Patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive 24 mg/kg of NEOD001 or placebo via intravenous infusion every 28 days, with both groups receiving concurrent standard of care therapy.
The composite primary endpoint is event-based, with all-cause mortality or cardiac hospitalizations as qualifying events. Secondary endpoints of the study include evaluation of the quality of life evaluation Short Forum-36 (“SF-36”) and Six-Minute Walk Test.
The PRONTO study was initiated in October 2015 and is a Phase 2b global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for NEOD001 in previously-treated patients with AL amyloidosis and persistent cardiac dysfunction. The original target enrollment of 100 patients was exceeded and 129 previously-treated patients with AL amyloidosis and persistent cardiac dysfunction have been randomized into the study. Patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive 24 mg/kg of NEOD001 or placebo via intravenous infusion every 28 days.
The primary endpoint is best response over 12 months of the cardiac biomarker NT-proBNP, defined by the consensus criteria of NT-proBNP change. Secondary endpoints include evaluations of SF-36 and Six-Minute Walk Test.
NT-proBNP is a cardiac biomarker that is widely used by clinicians who treat patients with AL amyloidosis to stage patients at baseline, determine treatment outcomes and predict survival. In multiple independent studies, NT-proBNP has been shown to predict survival in patients with AL amyloidosis (Merlini, et. al, Leukemia, 2016). Our scientists have generated and presented new preclinical data at the Heart Failure Society of America 21st Annual Scientific Meeting (HFSA, September 2017) that further supports the important role of the cardiac biomarker NT-proBNP in the biology of AL amyloidosis. This new preclinical data presented at HFSA provides mechanistic insight into how misfolded soluble light chains induce cardiotoxicity resulting in an increase to NT-proBNP production. This preclinical data demonstrated that misfolded soluble light chain induces oxidative stress and leads to an increase in expression of the oxidative response marker heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox-1) in cardiomyocytes. The research further showed that NT-proBNP secretion is increased by misfolded soluble light chain, via a mechanism dependent on Hmox-1 catalytic activity. Misfolded soluble light chain exhibited dose-dependent binding to cardiomyocytes, suggesting that the observed effect is driven by the direct interaction between misfolded soluble light chains and cardiomyocytes. Taken together, these results presented at the HFSA 21st Annual Scientific Meeting support the finding that misfolded soluble light chain induces cardiomyocyte toxicity and provides a direct link between misfolded soluble light chain and NT-proBNP elevation in AL 
4

amyloidosis. These data indicate that the role of NT-proBNP in AL amyloidosis is differentiated from other forms of heart failure, and support the relationship that has been reported between lowering of NT-proBNP and survival in patients with AL amyloidosis.
Cardiac, Renal and Peripheral Neuropathy Responses in Phase 1/2 Multiple Ascending Dose Study
The VITAL Amyloidosis Study and the PRONTO study were initiated based on data from the Phase 1/2 multiple ascending dose clinical study. In 2015, data from an interim assessment from the dose escalation phase of the Phase 1/2 clinical study were reported in oral presentations at both the American Society for Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting (ASCO) and the 20th Congress of the European Hematology Association (EHA) and subsequently published in February 2016 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. We presented the final analysis from the Phase 1/2 clinical study from patients in both the dose escalation and expansion phases in December 2016 at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting.
The Phase 1/2 study of NEOD001 enrolled patients with AL amyloidosis with persistent organ dysfunction who had been previously treated with standard-of-care plasma cell directed therapy. The Phase 1/2 study consisted of a dose escalation phase (n=27) and expansion phase (n=42) which evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of NEOD001 as well as the specific clinical activity against cardiac and renal endpoints. The expansion phase of this study also evaluated clinical activity against a neuropathy endpoint. The 42 patients in the expansion phase of the study were enrolled into three prospectively-defined cohorts as follows: 15 patients with predominantly cardiac dysfunction, 16 patients with predominantly renal dysfunction and 11 patients with predominantly peripheral neuropathy. All patients received 24 mg/kg of NEOD001 by intravenous infusion every 28 days.
Results of the Phase 1/2 study demonstrated that NEOD001 was safe and well-tolerated in patients with AL amyloidosis and persistent organ dysfunction. In this study, clinical assessments demonstrated improvements in three organ systems in previously treated patients with AL amyloidosis.
In a best response analysis of patients in the Phase 1/2 study who received NEOD001, 53% or 19 of 36 total cardiac-evaluable patients demonstrated a cardiac response, defined as at least 30% and 300 pg/mL decrease in levels of NT-proBNP. Of the 36 cardiac-evaluable patients, 50% or 18 patients demonstrated a cardiac response, defined as more than 30% and 300 pg/mL decrease in levels of NT-proBNP. In a best response analysis of patients in the Phase 1/2 study who received NEOD001, 64%, or 23 of 36 total renal-evaluable patients, demonstrated a renal response, defined as at least a 30% decrease in proteinuria in the absence of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) worsening. In addition, an improvement in peripheral neuropathy in patients in the prospectively defined peripheral neuropathy expansion cohort was demonstrated by a mean 33% (median 22%) decrease in NIS-LL measured at month 10, indicating improvement to a third organ system in NEOD001-treated patients. Complete resolution of peripheral neuropathy, as measured by NIS-LL, was achieved in two patients in this cohort. Improvements in patient NIS-LL scores resulted in a response rate of 82% or nine of 11 patients in the peripheral neuropathy expansion cohort of the Phase 1/2 study. A response on the NIS-LL is defined as a less than 2-point increase on the 88-point scale.
Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity
Data from the Phase 1/2 study demonstrated that monthly infusions (every 28 days) of NEOD001 were safe and well-tolerated in patients with AL amyloidosis and persistent organ dysfunction. A total of 69 patients received more than 990 infusions, of up to 24 mg/kg, with a mean treatment duration of 12.8 months. No hypersensitivity reactions or drug-related serious adverse events were reported and no persistent anti-NEOD001 antibodies were detected. NEOD001 also demonstrated excellent pharmacokinetic properties, supporting a dose level of 24 mg/kg administered every 28 days. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events of those occurring in more than 10% of subjects, regardless of relationship to study drug, were fatigue, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, peripheral edema, diarrhea, anemia, increased blood creatinine, dizziness, cough, constipation, headache, vomiting, dyspnea, pain in extremity, back pain, muscle spasms, rash and urinary tract infection. No dose limiting toxicities were observed and no patient discontinued treatment due to drug-related adverse events.
PRX002/RG7935 for the Potential Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease and other synucleinopathies
In December 2013, we entered into a License, Development, and Commercialization Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (collectively, “Roche”) to develop and commercialize certain antibodies that target α-synuclein, including PRX002/RG7935. Together with Roche, we aim to develop PRX002/RG7935 as a disease-modifying treatment for Parkinson’s disease and potentially other synucleinopathies. For more information on the License Agreement, see the information below.
The protein α-synuclein is found extensively in neurons and is a major component of pathological inclusions that characterize several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, 
5

which collectively are termed synucleinopathies. While the normal function of α-synuclein is not well understood, the protein normally occurs in a soluble form. In synucleinopathies, the α-synuclein protein can misfold and aggregate to form soluble aggregates and insoluble fibrils that contribute to the pathology of the disease.
There is genetic evidence for a causal role of α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease. In rare cases of familial forms of Parkinson’s disease, there are mutations in the synuclein protein sequence, or duplication and triplications of the relevant gene leading to high levels of α-synuclein production, which may cause α-synuclein protein to form amyloid-like fibrils that contribute to the disease. There is also increasing evidence that this disease-causing α-synuclein can be propagated and transmitted from neuron to neuron, resulting in a spreading of neuronal death. Recent studies in cellular and animal models suggest that the spread of α-synuclein-associated neurodegeneration can be disrupted by targeting aberrant forms of α-synuclein.
Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that affects approximately seven to ten million people worldwide, making it the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's. The disease is characterized by the neuronal accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein in the central nervous system (“CNS”) and peripheral nervous system that results in a wide spectrum of worsening progressive motor and non-motor symptoms. While diagnosis relies on motor symptoms classically associated with Parkinson's disease, non-motor symptoms may present many years earlier. Current treatments for Parkinson's disease are primarily directed at managing the early motor symptoms of the disease, mainly through the use of levodopa and dopamine agonists and only address a subset of symptoms such as motor impairment, dementia, or psychosis. Symptomatic therapies do not target the underlying cause of the disease and as the disease progresses and dopaminergic neurons continue to be lost, these drugs lose effectiveness, often leading to debilitating side effects as the disease progresses. The goal of our approach is to slow the progressive neurodegenerative consequences of disease, a current unmet need. PRX002/RG7935 targets α-synuclein and may slow or reduce the neurodegeneration associated with synuclein misfolding and/or transmission.
Clinical Development Program for PRX002/RG7935
Prior to initiating clinical trials, we tested the efficacy of PRX002/RG7935 in various cellular and animal models of α-synuclein-related disease. In transgenic mouse models of Parkinson’s disease, passive immunization with 9E4, the murine version of PRX002/RG7935, reduced the appearance of α-synuclein pathology, protected synapses and improved performance by the mice in behavioral testing.
During 2014, together with Roche, we advanced PRX002/RG7935 into clinical development with the initiation of two Phase 1 studies. Results of the first study, a Phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose trial, were presented in June 2015 as part of the late breaking session at the 19th International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders and published in December 2016 in the journal Movement Disorders. The data demonstrated that PRX002/RG7935 was safe and well-tolerated in healthy volunteers, meeting the primary objective of the study. Further, results from this study showed that administration of PRX002/RG7935 led to a mean reduction of free serum α-synuclein levels of up to 96.5%. These overall results were statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Reduction of free serum α-synuclein, a protein potentially involved in the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease and the target of PRX002/RG7935, was shown to be rapid, and dose- and time-dependent after a single dose. No serious adverse events or hypersensitivity reactions were reported. PRX002/RG7935 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic properties. The most common treatment emergent adverse events were headache, nausea, vessel puncture site pain, viral infection, and viral upper respiratory tract infection. In this study, all PRX002/RG7935-related adverse events were mild, no dose limiting toxicities were observed and no anti-drug antibodies were detected.
Results of the second study, a Phase 1b double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study of PRX002/RG7935 in 80 patients with Parkinson’s disease that was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of PRX002/RG7935, were presented by Dr. Joseph Jankovic of Baylor College of Medicine in April 2017 in a late-breaking therapeutic strategies session at the 13th International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s Disease (AD/PD). 
The 80 patients with Parkinson’s disease in this study were randomized into six escalating dose cohorts to receive PRX002/RG7935 or placebo (2:1 randomization for 0.3, 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg, and 3:1 randomization for 30 or 60 mg/kg). In this six-month study, patients received three monthly doses (intravenous infusion once every 28 days) of PRX002/RG7935 or placebo and were followed for an observational period of three months. All dose levels of PRX002/RG7935 were found to have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in patients with Parkinson’s disease, meeting the primary objective of the study. CNS penetration was demonstrated by a dose-dependent increase in PRX002/RG7935 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and a mean concentration of PRX002/RG7935 in CSF of 0.3% relative to serum across all dose levels, which exceeded our expectations based on our preclinical experience. Data from the study also demonstrated rapid, dose- and time-dependent mean reduction in levels of free serum alpha-synuclein of up to 97% after a single dose, which were statistically significant (p < 0.0001), and maintained following two additional monthly doses. No serious or severe treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in PRX002/RG7935 treated patients. No TEAEs were observed in ten percent or more of PRX002/RG7935 treated patients. TEAEs greater than placebo in 
6

five percent or more of PRX002/RG7935 treated patients, regardless of relationship to PRX002/RG7935, included constipation, infusion related reactions (IRRs), diarrhoea, peripheral oedema, and post lumbar puncture syndrome. Mild-to-moderate IRRs, that all resolved, were limited to the 60 mg/kg dose cohort and were observed in four of 12 treated patients. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. PRX002/RG7935 demonstrated acceptable pharmacokinetic properties.
The results from this study further supported advancing PRX002/RG7935 into the Phase 2 study, PASADENA, that was initiated by Roche in the second quarter of 2017. PASADENA is a two-part Phase 2 clinical study in early Parkinson's disease patients that is being conducted by Roche. Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm study designed to enroll approximately 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PRX002/RG7935 in patients over 52 weeks. In part 1, patients will be randomized on a 1:1:1 basis to receive one of two active doses (1500 mg or 4500 mg) of PRX002/RG7935 or placebo via intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks. Eligible patients must not be on dopaminergic therapy and must not be expected to require dopaminergic therapy for at least 52 weeks. Part 2 of the study is a 52-week blinded extension phase in which patients from the placebo arm of the study will be re-randomized onto one of two active doses on a 1:1 basis, so that all participants will be on active treatment. Patients who were originally randomized to an active dose will continue at that dose level for the additional 52 weeks. In part 2, patients will be allowed to use concomitant dopaminergic therapy. Any patient who medically requires initiation of dopaminergic therapy during part 1 will have their subsequent data censored for the primary endpoint analysis.
The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 PASADENA study is the comparison of change from baseline in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) total score (sections 1, 2 and 3) at the completion of part 1 (week 52) in each treatment group vs. the placebo group. Key secondary endpoints include safety, tolerability and DaT-SPECT imaging.
License, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with Roche
In December 2013, we entered into the License Agreement with Roche to develop and commercialize certain antibodies that target α-synuclein, including PRX002/RG7935, which are referred to in this report collectively as “Licensed Products.” The License Agreement became effective on January 17, 2014, which triggered an upfront payment to us of $30.0 million from Roche, which we received in February 2014. In July 2017, we announced that the first patient has been enrolled in PASADENA, a global Phase 2 study of PRX002/RG7935 in patients with early Parkinson's disease. The start of the Phase 2 PASADENA study triggered a $30 million milestone payment from Roche to Prothena, which was earned in the second quarter of 2017. Prothena had previously received $45 million in upfront and development milestone payments.
Pursuant to the License Agreement, we are collaborating with Roche to research and develop antibody products targeting α-synuclein. Roche is providing funding for this research collaboration, which is focused on optimizing early stage antibodies targeting α-synuclein, potentially including incorporation of Roche’s proprietary Brain Shuttle™ technology to increase delivery of therapeutic antibodies to the brain. Roche is primarily responsible for developing, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for, and commercializing Licensed Products under the collaboration, including PRX002/RG7935. Roche is responsible for the clinical and commercial manufacture and supply of Licensed Products within a defined time period following the effective date of the License Agreement.
In addition to the $30.0 million upfront payment and clinical milestone payment of $15.0 million (both in 2014) and the clinical milestone payment of $30.0 million in 2017, Roche is also obligated to pay:

• | up to $350.0 million upon the achievement of additional development, regulatory and various first commercial sales milestones;


• | up to an additional $175.0 million in ex-U.S. commercial sales milestones; and


• | tiered, high single-digit to high double-digit royalties in the teens on ex-U.S. annual net sales, subject to certain adjustments.

In the U.S., Prothena and Roche share all development and commercialization costs, as well as profits, all of which will be allocated 70% to Roche and 30% to us, for PRX002/RG7935 in the Parkinson’s disease indication, as well as any other licensed products and/or indications for which we opt in to co-develop and co-fund. We may opt out of the co-development and cost and profit sharing on any co-developed licensed products and instead receive U.S. commercial sales milestones totaling up to $155.0 million and tiered, single-digit to high double-digit royalties in the teens based on U.S. annual net sales, subject to certain adjustments, with respect to the applicable licensed product. In addition, we have an option under the License Agreement to co-promote PRX002/RG7935 in the U.S. in the Parkinson’s disease indication. If we exercise such option, we may also elect to co-
7

promote additional licensed products in the U.S. approved for Parkinson’s disease or other indications calling on the same prescriber. Outside the U.S., Roche has responsibility for developing and commercializing the licensed products.
Under the License Agreement with Roche, we granted to Roche an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import and export the Licensed Products. The License Agreement continues on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of all payment obligations thereunder. The License Agreement may also be terminated (i) by Roche at will after the first anniversary of the effective date of the License Agreement, either in its entirety or on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, upon 90 days’ prior written notice to us prior to first commercial sale and 180 days’ prior written notice to us after first commercial sale, (ii) by either party, either in its entirety or on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product or region-by-region basis, upon written notice in connection with a material breach uncured 90 days after initial written notice, and (iii) by either party, in its entirety, upon insolvency of the other party. The License Agreement may be terminated by either party on a patent-by-patent and country-by-country basis if the other party challenges a given patent in a given country. Our rights to co-develop licensed products under the License Agreement will terminate if we commence certain studies for certain types of competitive products. Our rights to co-promote licensed products under the License Agreement will terminate if we commence a Phase 3 study for such competitive products.
PRX004 for the Potential Treatment of ATTR Amyloidosis
PRX004 is an investigational monoclonal antibody designed to specifically target and clear the misfolded (toxic) forms of the TTR amyloid protein found in ATTR amyloidosis.
Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis) is a rare, progressive and often fatal disease characterized by deposition of aggregates of misfolded protein, or amyloid. There are three types of ATTR amyloidosis: hereditary ATTR with cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM); wild-type ATTR which occurs sporadically and also involves cardiomyopathy (wtATTR); and hereditary ATTR with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN).
The TTR protein is produced primarily in the liver and in its normal tetrameric form serves as a carrier for thyroxin and vitamin A and is also implicated in neuroprotective functions. In hereditary ATTR (hATTR), the body makes a mutant form of the TTR protein. There are more than 100 reported types of TTR mutations that promote amyloid fibril formation, which most commonly affect the heart (hATTR-CM) and nervous system (hATTR-PN). Wild-type ATTR is similar to hereditary ATTR except that the protein that is deposited is the misfolded, non-mutated transthyretin protein. The wild-type transthyretin protein is less prone to forming amyloid deposits than the mutated form and patients usually develop the disease at 65 years of age or older.
Clinical development program for PRX004
Prothena has generated monoclonal antibodies that selectively bind to amyloidogenic (diseased) forms of the transthyretin (ATTR) protein. Preclinical data published in March 2016 in the journal Amyloid suggest that Prothena's antibodies have unique biological activity that may lead to the prevention of deposition, and enhancement of clearance, of ATTR in patients with both wild type and hereditary TTR-mediated amyloidosis.
Additionally, Prothena has developed a proprietary, high-sensitivity assay that specifically detects circulating misfolded-hATTR in plasma across multiple TTR mutations and can be used in clinical studies to monitor pharmacodynamic response to PRX004 in plasma.
Currently in late-stage preclinical development, Prothena plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study of PRX004 for the potential treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. The Phase 1 study is designed as an open-label, dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and maximum tolerated dose of PRX004 and is expected to enroll up to 36 patients with hATTR amyloidosis.
Our Discovery Programs
Our pipeline also includes several discovery-stage programs for neurodegenerative or orphan diseases and includes targets such as tau, Aβ, ALECT2, TDP-43 and others that are implicated in devastating diseases that lack effective therapies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), ALECT2 amyloidosis, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). If promising, we expect to advance programs into preclinical development. New target discovery will focus on the potential treatment of neurodegenerative or orphan indications where we can bring these therapies to patients expeditiously through our internal expertise and resources. Existing late discovery-stage programs with non-orphan indications may be partnered or out-licensed. Targets in our discovery pipeline include the following:
8


• | Tau, a protein implicated in diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE ) and other tauopathies. Prothena has identified antibodies targeting novel epitopes on the tau protein with the potential to block misfolded tau from binding to cells and to inhibit cell-to-cell transmission, preventing downstream toxic functional effects.


• | Aβ, or Amyloid Beta, a protein implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Prothena scientists have advanced the understanding of the biology of AD and made particularly impactful and fundamental discoveries that elucidated the role amyloid plays in the disease. Today, Prothena is advancing a new approach to design a more potent anti-Aβ antibody.


• | LECT2, a protein implicated in ALECT2 amyloidosis. Similar to AL amyloidosis and ATTR amyloidosis, ALECT2 amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by deposits of misfolded aggregated protein in vital organs, most often the kidneys and liver. Prothena has identified novel epitopes on the misfolded forms of the protein.

Regulation
We anticipate that if we commercialize any products, the U.S. market will ultimately be our most important market. For this reason, the laws and regulations discussed below focus on the requirements applicable to biologic products in the U.S.
Government Regulation
Governmental authorities, including the FDA, the EMA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, regulate the development, testing, safety, efficacy, labeling, manufacturing, storage, record-keeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of pharmaceutical products, including biologics. The FDA does so under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations and guidance for industry, and the U.S. Public Health Service Act and its implementing regulations. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines and other judicially imposed sanctions, including product seizures, import restrictions, injunctive actions and criminal prosecutions of both companies and individuals. In addition, administrative remedies can involve requests to recall violative products; the refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts; or the refusal to approve pending applications for product approval until manufacturing or other alleged deficiencies are brought into compliance. The FDA and other comparable regulatory authorities also have the authority to cause the withdrawal of approval of a marketed product or to impose additional labeling restrictions.
The pricing of pharmaceutical products is regulated in many countries and the mechanism of price regulation varies. In the U.S., while there are limited indirect federal government price controls over private sector purchases of drugs, it is not possible to predict future regulatory action or private sector initiatives on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
Product Approval
United States. In the U.S., our drug candidates are regulated as biologic pharmaceuticals, or biologics. The FDA regulates biologics under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, U.S. Public Health Service Act and its implementing regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;


• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the efficacy and safety of the product for each proposed indication, all performed in accordance with FDA’s current good clinical practices (“cGCP”) requirements;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for a new biologic, after completion of all required clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced and tested to assess compliance with regulatory requirements, including current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) regulations; and

9


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA for a new biologic, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the U.S.

Nonclinical tests assess the potential safety and efficacy of a product candidate in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. The results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND before human testing may proceed. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug or biologic product to humans. The IND includes the general investigational plan and the proposed protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of nonclinical studies and other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any other available data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may be initiated. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to initiation of the proposed clinical trial(s). In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial(s) may begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing a clinical trial(s) to commence.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must provide oversight of the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
The clinical investigation of a pharmaceutical, including a biologic, is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:
•Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational product into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, appropriate dosage, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80;
•Phase 2. Phase 2 includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the efficacy and safety of the investigational product for a specific indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage for further studies, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants; and
•Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, efficacy and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants.
The clinical trial process can take many years to complete, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval of the product. The FDA may place clinical trials on hold at any point in this process if, among other reasons, it concludes that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Trials may also be terminated by IRBs, which must review and approve all research involving human subjects. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing authorization.
The results of the nonclinical and clinical testing, along with information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls of the product and proposed product labeling, are evaluated and, if determined appropriate, submitted to the FDA through a BLA. The application includes all relevant data available from nonclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other required information. Data from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the efficacy and safety of a proposed use of a product, and/or from alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators may be included in a BLA.
10

Once the BLA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s standard goal is to review applications within ten months of the filing date for Standard Review or, in the case of Priority Review, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective, which includes determining whether it is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.
The FDA has four expedited program designations for serious conditions - Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval and Priority Review - to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. The Fast Track designation provides pharmaceutical manufacturers with opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA during the product’s development and for a rolling review of the BLA. A rolling review allows for completed portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA prior to submission of the complete application. The Breakthrough Therapy designation provides sponsors with all of the features of the Fast Track designation as well as intensive guidance on implementing an efficient development program for the product and a commitment by the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in the review. The Accelerated Approval designation allows the FDA to approve a product based on an effect on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a product’s clinical benefit and generally requires the sponsor to conduct required post-approval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit. The Priority Review designation signifies that the FDA review clock for the BLA is six months, compared to ten months under standard review.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and conducts pre-approval inspections of manufacturing facilities where the candidate product and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient will be produced, of clinical sites and of the sponsor, if deemed necessary, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may impose conditions for approval including but not limited to, changes to proposed labeling, changes to manufacturing controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or additional clinical trials. Such post- market commitments may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
European Union. In Europe, there are several pathways for marketing approval, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a sponsor submits a single application to the EMA. The marketing application is similar to the BLA submitted to FDA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”), the expert scientific committee of the EMA. If the CHMP determines that the marketing application fulfills the requirements for efficacy, safety and quality (equivalent to chemistry, manufacturing and controls in the US), it will submit a favorable opinion to the European Commission (the “EC”). The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A marketing application approved by the EC is valid in all EU member states.
In addition to the centralized procedure, the EC also has: (i) national authorization procedures, which requires a separate application in and approval determination by each country; (ii) a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and (iii) a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and approval, and other countries may accept or reject the decision in the initial country. Regardless of the approval process employed, various regulatory authorities share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection, and evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national authorities, the EMA, the EC, and the marketing authorization holder.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse events, and submitting biological product deviation reports to notify the FDA of unanticipated changes in distributed products. Additionally, any significant change in the 
11

approved product or in how it is manufactured, including changes in formulation or the site of manufacture, generally require prior FDA approval. The packaging and labeling of all products developed by us are also subject to FDA approval and ongoing regulation.
Sponsors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP standards, which impose certain quality processes, manufacturing controls and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that the product is safe, has the identity and strength, and meets the quality, purity and potency characteristics that it purports to have. Certain states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Noncompliance with cGMP or other requirements can result in issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures, and injunctive action.
FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers and sponsors must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA and other federal and state agencies closely regulate the labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs. While doctors are free to prescribe any product approved by the FDA for any use, a company can only make claims relating to safety and efficacy of a product that are consistent with FDA approval, and the company is allowed to market a drug only for the particular use(s) approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions, potential civil and criminal penalties, criminal prosecution, and agreements with governmental agencies that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. Government regulators, including the Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities, have increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs.
The FDA also enforces the requirements of the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians. Sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, the U.S. False Claims Act, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. We may also be subject to the U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”) which regulates disclosure of payments to healthcare professionals and providers.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and U.K. Bribery Act prohibit companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to governmental officials (and certain private individuals under the U.K. Bribery Act) for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we interact with may meet the definition of a government official for purposes of the FCPA. Failure to comply with domestic or non-domestic laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.
Orphan Drugs
Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as demonstration of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. As a result, even if one of our drug candidates receives orphan exclusivity, the FDA can still approve other drugs that 
12

have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication or disease. Furthermore, the FDA can waive orphan exclusivity if we are unable to manufacture sufficient supply of our product.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and other government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and other governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost- containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Other Healthcare Laws
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, if our drug candidates are approved and we begin commercialization, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and other jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Intellectual Property
We seek to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we believe is important to our business, including by seeking, maintaining and defending patents. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how to protect our business. We seek licenses from others as appropriate to enhance or maintain our competitive position.
Our intellectual property is primarily directed to immunological approaches to the treatment of diseases that involve amyloid or cell adhesion, and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product development candidates.
We own or hold exclusive licenses to a number of issued U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications, as well as issued non-U.S. patents and pending Patent Cooperation Treaty applications and non-U.S. counterparts. As of December 31, 2017, our patent portfolio included the following patents or patent applications that we own or have exclusively licensed from other parties:

• | Approximately 6 patent families related to AL or AA amyloidosis, including our NEOD001 program;


• | Approximately 14 patent families related to Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies, including our PRX002 program;


• | Approximately 13 patent families related to inflammatory diseases including psoriasis, including our PRX003 program;


• | Approximately 7 patent families related to ATTR amyloidosis, including our PRX004 program; and


• | Approximately 12 patent families related to other potential targets of intervention and diseases.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the U.S., a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to 
13

multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
The patents referenced above have expiration dates ranging from 2020 through 2038 (excluding any available patent term extensions).
University of Tennessee License Agreement: Under a License Agreement with the University of Tennessee Research Foundation, we have exclusively licensed from the University of Tennessee its joint ownership interest in certain patents jointly owned with us. Those patents relate to our program targeting amyloidosis. Under that sublicensable, worldwide license, we are required to pay to the University of Tennessee an amount equal to 1% of net sales of any product covered by any licensed patent, plus certain additional payments in the event that all or a portion of the license is sublicensed. To date, we have not paid or incurred any royalties to the University of Tennessee under our agreement. The agreement is effective on a country-by-country basis for the longer of (i) a period of twenty years from the effective date of the agreement, or (ii) in each country in which a valid claim for any licensed patent or patent application exists, expiration of such valid claim. The agreement will terminate prior to the end of its term if we become insolvent unless the University of Tennessee elects to allow the agreement to remain in effect. The University of Tennessee may terminate the agreement prior to the end of its term upon our failure to make payment under the agreement within 120 days of notice of such failure or upon our material breach of the agreement, which breach has not been cured within 60 days of written notice of such breach. We may terminate the agreement prior to the end of its term if we have paid all amounts due to the University of Tennessee through the effective date of the termination and provide three months’ written notice to the University of Tennessee or upon material breach of the agreement by the University of Tennessee, which breach has not been cured within 60 days of written notice of such breach.
University of California License Agreement: Under a License Agreement with The Regents of the University of California, we have exclusively licensed from the University of California its joint ownership interest in certain patents jointly owned with us. Those patents relate to our program targeting α-synuclein. Under that sublicensable, worldwide license, we are required to pay to the University of California an amount equal to 1% of net sales of any product covered by any licensed patent, plus certain additional payments for milestones achieved and sublicense revenue. To date, we have not paid or incurred any royalties to the University of California under our agreement. The agreement is effective until the expiration date of the last to expire licensed patent. The obligation to pay royalties continues on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last to expire patent containing a valid claim covering the applicable product. The agreement will terminate prior to the end of its term without prior written notice if (i) we, or third parties on our behalf or at our written urging, file a claim including an assertion that any portion of the licensed patents is invalid or unenforceable, or (ii) upon the filing of a petition for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code by or against us as a debtor or alleged debtor. The University of California may terminate the agreement prior to the end of its term upon our default, if we fail to cure the default within 60 days of written notice of such default. We may terminate the agreement prior to the end of its term upon a 90 day written notice to the University of California.
Elan License Agreement: Under an Amended and Restated Intellectual Property License and Contribution Agreement with Elan and certain of its affiliates, we have exclusively licensed from Elan and those affiliates certain patents and patent applications owned by them, and exclusively sublicensed from Elan and those affiliates certain patents and patent applications owned by Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy. Those licenses are worldwide, fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable, and relate to our program targeting α-synuclein. Subsequent to entering into this Agreement, Elan was acquired by Perrigo Company plc. 
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors consist of major international companies, all of which are larger and have greater financial resources, technical staff, manufacturing, R&D and marketing capabilities than we have. We also compete with smaller research companies and generic drug and biosimilar manufacturers. The degree of competition varies for each of our programs.
A drug may be subject to competition from alternative therapies during the period of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity and thereafter it may be subject to further competition from generic products or biosimilars. Governmental and other pressures toward the dispensing of generic products or biosimilars may rapidly and significantly reduce, slow or reverse the growth, sales and profitability of any product not protected by patents or regulatory exclusivity, and may adversely affect our future results and financial condition. If we successfully discover, develop and commercialize any products, the launch of competitive products, including generic or biosimilar versions of any such products, may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
14

Our competitive position depends in part upon our ability to discover and develop innovative and cost-effective new products. If we fail to discover and develop new products, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, testing or distribution of preclinical or clinical supplies of any of our drug candidates. We instead contract with and rely on third-parties to manufacture, package, label, store, test and distribute all pre-clinical development and clinical supplies of our drug candidates, and we plan to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We also rely on third-party consultants to assist us with managing these third-parties and with our manufacturing strategy.
NEOD001 - Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals GmbH (“BI”) has manufactured and is contracted to continue to manufacture clinical supplies of our drug candidate NEOD001 for all of its clinical trials. We are dependent on BI to continue to manufacture these clinical supplies.
We have contracted with Rentschler Biopharma SE (formerly known as Rentschler Biotechnologie GmbH) (“Rentschler”) to develop the capability to manufacture and supply drug substance of NEOD001, and to so supply NEOD001 to us for worldwide commercial sale purposes if we apply for and obtain regulatory approval to market NEOD001.  In order to be able to use drug substance supplied by Rentschler for commercial purposes, we will need to first establish comparability of drug substance manufactured by Rentschler with clinical supplies manufactured by BI and used by us in clinical development of NEOD001.
We have contracted with BI to develop the capability to manufacture and supply drug substance of NEOD001, and to so supply NEOD001 to us for worldwide commercial sale purposes if we apply for and obtain regulatory approval to market NEOD001.  In order to be able to use drug substance supplied by BI for commercial purposes, we will need to first establish a validated manufacturing process and obtain regulatory approval to use such drug substance for commercial purposes.

PRX002/RG7935 - BI manufactured clinical supplies of our drug candidate PRX002/RG7935 for our completed Phase 1a single ascending dose and Phase 1b multiple ascending dose clinical trials. Roche, with whom we are collaborating on development of PRX002/RG7935, is manufacturing clinical supplies for the Phase 2 and any subsequent clinical trials for PRX002/RG7935. We are dependent on Roche to manufacture these clinical supplies.
PRX004 - Rentschler is our third party manufacturer of clinical supplies of our drug candidate PRX004.  We are dependent on Rentschler to manufacture these clinical supplies in order to initiate clinical trials for PRX004.
