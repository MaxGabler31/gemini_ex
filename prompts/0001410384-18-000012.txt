Item 1. Business.
Overview
Q2 is a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital banking solutions. We enable regional and community financial institutions, or RCFIs, to deliver a robust suite of integrated digital banking services to more effectively engage with their consumer and commercial account holders who expect to bank anytime, anywhere and on any device. Our solutions are often the most frequent point of interaction between our RCFI customers and their account holders. As such, we purpose build our solutions to deliver a compelling, consistent user experience across digital channels and drive the success of our customers by extending their local brands, enabling improved account holder retention and creating incremental sales opportunities.
Our founding team has provided software solutions to the RCFI market for over 25 years, and they started Q2 with the mission of using technology to help RCFIs succeed and strengthen the communities they serve. We leverage our deep domain expertise to develop highly-secure digital banking solutions designed to help our customers compete in the complex and heavily-regulated financial services industry. We internally design and develop our solutions around a common platform that tightly integrates our solutions with each other and with our customers' internal and third-party systems. This integrated approach delivers to account holders a unified and robust digital banking experience across online, mobile and voice channels and allows for close, lasting relationships. We design our solutions and data center infrastructure to comply with the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions and safeguard our customers and their account holders.
The RCFI market includes approximately 11,500 banks and credit unions that compete to provide financial services in the U.S. RCFIs have historically sought to differentiate themselves and create account holder loyalty by providing localized, in-branch banking services and serving as centers of commerce and influence in their communities. However, account holders increasingly engage with their financial services providers across digital channels rather than in physical branches, making it easier for account holders to access competitive financial services and more difficult for RCFIs to maintain account holder loyalty. Innovation in financial services technologies, the proliferation of mobile and tablet devices and evolving consumer expectations for new financial services and modern and intuitive user experiences are pressuring RCFIs to deliver advanced digital banking and other financial services to successfully compete and grow. RCFIs are increasingly considering new ways to complement their digital banking services with innovative financial services, including developing their own applications integrated with their digital banking services and partnering with financial technology companies.
RCFIs, unlike larger national banks, typically operate without all of the resources and personnel required to effectively deploy, manage and enhance their own internally-developed digital banking offerings. In addition, RCFIs are required to spend increasing amounts of time and money complying with rapidly changing federal and state rules and regulations and frequent examinations by regulatory agencies. As a result, RCFIs are challenged to satisfy account holder expectations and compete effectively in what has become a complex and dynamic environment. These challenges often cause RCFIs to rely on disparate,

third-party and internally-developed point solutions to deliver digital banking services. However, many of these solutions provide limited features and functionality or can be expensive and time-intensive to implement, maintain and upgrade.
Based on our current prices and digital banking solutions, we believe that the RCFI market is greater than $3.5 billion annually. Our current Q2 platform customers represent approximately 3% of the 11,420 federally-insured RCFIs in the U.S. with less than $50 billion in assets. We believe we can capture an increasing portion of the IT spend among RCFIs as we continue to grow our customer base and introduce new solutions.
Our software-as-a-service, or SaaS, delivery model is designed to scale with our RCFI customers as they add account holders on our solutions and expand the breadth of digital banking services they offer. Our SaaS delivery model is also designed to reduce the cost and complexity of implementing, maintaining and enhancing the digital banking services our RCFI customers provide to their account holders. Our solutions allow RCFIs the flexibility to configure the solutions to function in a manner that is consistent with their specific workflows, processes and controls and personalize the experiences they deliver to their account holders by extending the services and local character of their branches across digital channels.
We primarily sell subscriptions to our cloud-based solutions through our direct sales organization and recognize the related revenues over the terms of our customer agreements. The initial term of our Q2 platform customer agreements averages over five years, although it varies by customer. Our revenues increase as we add new customers and sell additional solutions to existing customers and as our customers increase the number of account holders on our solutions. We earn additional revenues based on the number of transactions that account holders perform on our digital banking solutions. We support the efforts of our sales organization through a network of key association partners, such as the American Bankers Association, National Association for Federally Insured Credit Unions, Texas Bankers Association and Western Bankers Association.
 We have achieved significant growth since our inception. We had total revenues of $194.0 million, $150.2 million and $108.9 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We seek to deepen and grow our customer relationships by providing consistent, high-quality implementation and customer support services which we believe drives higher customer retention and incremental sales opportunities within our existing customer base. As of December 31, 2017, we had 382 installed Q2 platform customers located in 48 states. Those customers had approximately 10.4 million consumer and commercial users registered on our platform solutions, and these registered users executed over $574 billion in financial transactions with our platform solutions during 2017. 
We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, to grow our business by expanding our sales and marketing activities, developing new solutions, enhancing our existing solutions and technical infrastructure and scaling our operations. We incurred net losses of $26.2 million, $36.4 million and $25.1 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had total assets of $212.8 million, $201.0 million and $204.5 million, respectively. 
We were incorporated in March 2005 in the state of Delaware under the name CBG Holdings, Inc. We changed our name to Q2 Holdings, Inc. in March 2013. We are headquartered in Austin, Texas, and our principal executive offices are located at 13785 Research Blvd, Suite 150, Austin, Texas 78750. Our telephone number is (512) 275-0072.
Industry Background
RCFIs are a substantial and critical part of the economy
Regional and community banks and credit unions with less than $50 billion in assets comprised 11,420 of the approximately 11,500 federally-insured financial institutions in the U.S., as of September 30, 2017, according to data compiled by BauerFinancial. Further, banking institutions and credit unions with less than $50 billion in assets had assets of $4.8 trillion and $1.3 trillion, respectively, as of September 30, 2017, according to BauerFinancial.
The U.S. financial services market is intensely competitive, and RCFIs have historically sought to differentiate themselves by providing local, personalized banking services that are responsive to the changing needs and circumstances of their communities. Many RCFIs are locally-owned and obtain deposits and make lending decisions on a local basis. As a result, RCFIs often develop strong, lasting relationships with their account holders and serve as centers of commerce and influence in their communities.

RCFIs must respond to innovations in banking
A substantial majority of U.S. banks and U.S. credit unions now offer digital banking services to their consumer and commercial account holders, and account holders have increasingly come to expect and rely upon a wider range of digital banking services to meet their banking needs. By providing online account access and other digital banking services, financial institutions are able to better engage with and sell more products and services to their account holders through digital channels. To appeal to those account holders who utilize digital banking services, RCFIs must deliver robust digital banking capabilities that allow account holders to seamlessly transition between physical branches and digital channels.
Financial service providers are innovating and expanding the digital banking services they offer. In recent years, digital banking services have grown beyond simple account access to view balances and pay bills, to more advanced self-service features such as remote check deposit, peer-to-peer payments and online loan application and approval. To remain competitive, RCFIs must keep pace with the innovation in the financial services industry by frequently enhancing the quality and scope of the digital banking services they offer.
The proliferation of mobile devices and evolving consumer expectations for modern and intuitive user experiences increase the challenges of offering digital banking solutions
The proliferation of smart mobile devices expands the channels through which account holders can perform digital banking activities, decreasing the need to visit physical bank branches. The accelerating adoption of these devices and the extension of digital banking services to new devices are making it increasingly difficult to provide a consistent, intuitive and personalized user experience and driving the need to provide digital banking solutions that support new and rapidly changing mobile operating systems and device types. The technical and operational complexities of delivering integrated digital banking services across multiple operating systems and devices increases the difficulty of providing a consistent, intuitive and personalized user experience.
Prominent consumer brands such as Amazon, Google and Netflix are continually innovating and shaping consumer expectations by delivering modern, intuitive user experiences across digital channels. We believe the frequency and duration with which consumers visit a website or mobile application is heavily influenced by the quality and ease-of-use of the user experience. As a result, RCFIs must deliver compelling user experiences to satisfy account holder expectations and increase engagement and account holder loyalty.
Security is of paramount importance in digital banking
The risks of theft and fraud have always existed in banking. However, as the adoption and use of digital banking services has increased, the incidence of fraud and theft in digital channels has grown substantially. The methods by which criminals seek to commit fraud are constantly changing, requiring financial institutions to continually modify their security strategies. In addition, safeguarding RCFI and account holder funds and information becomes increasingly complex as digital banking services grow and extend across new channels and devices.
Market dynamics are driving demand for third-party solutions
RCFIs, unlike larger national banks, typically operate without all of the resources and personnel required to effectively deploy, manage, and enhance their own internally-developed digital banking service offerings. Following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and the increased rule-making and examination efforts imposed by federal and state regulatory officials, RCFIs are having to commit additional time and resources to compliance matters. As a result, RCFIs are challenged to operate successfully in what has become a complex and dynamic environment.
These market dynamics are driving greater demand among RCFIs for modern, intuitive digital banking solutions from leading third-party providers. Based on our current prices and digital banking solutions, we believe that the RCFI market is greater than $3.5 billion annually. As RCFIs continue to embrace digital banking, they will need partners who can help them maintain and enhance the level of personalization they can deliver to their account holders in an effort to continue to differentiate themselves. We believe we can capture an increasing portion of the market for RCFI spend on IT, and in particular their spend on new initiatives, as we continue to broaden the scope of our digital banking solutions by identifying additional solutions that will further benefit and grow our RCFI customers' account holder bases.

Organizations are increasingly transitioning to SaaS providers
Many organizations are transitioning from solutions which are deployed on-premises under a traditional enterprise license arrangement to cloud-based solutions offered under a SaaS model. SaaS solutions can provide a number of benefits to RCFIs, such as lower costs of ownership and operation, improved performance and integration, greater flexibility and scalability, easier deployment of upgrades and enhancements and efficient compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, legacy systems cannot easily handle the introduction of new channels and devices, resulting in ongoing costly and time-consuming work to keep pace with rapid technology innovation.
Traditional digital banking systems have limitations
Many traditional digital banking systems were originally developed over a decade ago to address a single type of account holder or specific digital channel such as voice banking. These systems can create the following challenges for RCFIs:

• | integrating applications and digital channels from multiple vendors may increase an RCFI's implementation costs, time-to-market or both;


• | managing relationships with multiple vendors may be more time consuming and require greater management infrastructure;


• | operating, supporting and upgrading systems from multiple vendors can be difficult, costly and less secure and generally do not provide for a unified user experience or a comprehensive view of an account holder; and


• | training account holders and internal personnel on the use of different point systems can be challenging, time-consuming and costly.

The use of multiple point systems for digital banking can require account holders to maintain different login credentials for their consumer and commercial accounts across digital channels and learn and understand different systems. Additionally, the disjointed nature of the underlying workflows, data and terminology caused by the implementation of multiple solutions can lead to decreased account holder adoption, retention and satisfaction. Account holders' adoption, retention and satisfaction can be adversely impacted by the dated user interfaces of older legacy systems.
We believe innovation in financial services technologies, the proliferation of mobile and tablet devices and evolving consumer expectations for modern and intuitive user experiences, combined with the limitations of traditional systems, create a significant opportunity for a SaaS provider to address the challenges RCFIs face as they seek to increase their level of engagement with account holders across digital channels and drive account holder loyalty. We believe this opportunity creates a substantial and growing market for cloud-based digital banking solutions that deliver modern, intuitive self-service banking capabilities with a compelling and personalized user experience across digital channels and devices, while complying with regulatory requirements and safeguarding RCFIs and their account holders from fraud and theft.

We provide secure, compliant cloud-based software solutions designed to enable RCFIs to grow their account holder bases, increase their profitability and market share, simplify their operations and lower their operating expenses, all by leveraging the power of digital banking. Our solutions are often the most frequent point of interaction between our RCFI customers and their account holders. As such, we purpose build our solutions to deliver a compelling, consistent user experience across digital channels and devices, promoting account holder acquisition and retention and creating incremental sales opportunities.
Key Attributes
Our digital banking solutions include the following key attributes:

• | Comprehensive view of account holders: Our cloud-based solutions and common platform provide our RCFI customers with a comprehensive view of account holder access and activity across devices and channels. The understanding and analysis made possible by this comprehensive view enable an enhanced, personalized user experience, real-time risk and fraud assessment and other analytic features that improve the utility of our solutions.


• | Flexible integration: We have developed a highly flexible set of integration tools, enabling the rapid integration of third-party applications and data sources. This large set of internally-developed integration tools connects with over 200 third-party applications, allowing us to seamlessly integrate with RCFIs' internal and third-party systems such as account services, payments and imaging.

Our customers subscribe and pay for their use of our solutions over time, and our solutions do not require our customers to install any significant technical infrastructure.


• | Regulatory compliance: Our solutions leverage our deep domain expertise and the significant investments we have made in the design and development of our data center architecture and other technical infrastructure to meet the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions.


• | Security: Our solutions provide both behavioral analytics and policy-based decision prompts to identify suspect transactions and allow RCFI administrators to analyze transaction activity.

Key Benefits
We believe our solutions provide the following key benefits to our RCFI customers and their account holders:

• | Delivery of robust digital banking services across digital channels: Our solutions enable our RCFI customers to deliver robust and integrated digital banking services to their account holders who increasingly expect and appreciate the freedom to bank anytime, anywhere and on any device. Through a single log-in and consistent workflow, users are able to seamlessly conduct consumer and commercial transactions across digital channels and devices.


• | Improved and more frequent engagement with account holders: The breadth of our digital banking solutions and quality of the user experience they provide enable our RCFI customers to increase the frequency and effectiveness of their interactions with account holders. Our customers interact significantly more on average with account holders through our solutions than in physical branches. The frequency of these interactions can strengthen the relationships between account holders and our RCFI customers and help our customers gain a better understanding of the behavior and activities of their account holders to better serve them.


• | Drive account holder loyalty: We believe our RCFI customers are able to drive account holder loyalty by increasing their level of engagement with account holders and consolidating their digital banking activities on a single platform across devices and digital channels. Our customers are also able to tailor our solutions by offering individually relevant functionality as well as branded, localized user experiences. We believe this further strengthens loyalty by extending account holders' emotional ties to local branches into digital channels.


• | More effective marketing of products and services: Our customers' marketing of their new and existing products and services through our solutions can be more frequent, timely and targeted than through traditional advertising. The ease and availability of communications within these digital channels also make it easier for account holders to find information about products and services whenever needed.


• | Real-time security: Our Q2 Sentinel (formerly known as Risk & Fraud Analytics) offering allows our customers to better identify suspect activities and protect against fraud and theft by monitoring and understanding the behavior and activities of their account holders across channels. Customers leveraging Q2 Sentinel are able to block suspected fraudulent activity in real-time at the application layer and notify RCFI operations staff and account holders of suspect transactions prior to funds leaving the financial institution. By approaching security in this and other ways, our customers can better safeguard their account holders and themselves, reducing risk and protecting their reputations. The products added through our July 2015 acquisition of Centrix Solutions, Inc., or Centrix, further strengthen our security, compliance and risk management capabilities and offerings.


• | Lower total cost of ownership: Our SaaS delivery model can reduce the total cost of ownership of our customers by providing on a subscription basis the development, implementation, integration, maintenance, monitoring and support of our cloud-based solutions. Our common platform is designed to support the rapid addition of new services as well as the introduction of new devices and digital channels. As a result, our customers can easily and cost-effectively scale the use of our solutions with their needs as they add account holders and registered users and expand the digital banking services they offer.

• | Facilitate regulatory compliance: Customers who use our cloud-based solutions are able to satisfy security and technical compliance obligations by relying on the security programs and regulatory certification of our data centers and other technical infrastructure. By doing so, our customers eliminate significant cost and effort associated with building, maintaining and upgrading a regulatory-compliant environment on their own.

Our Business Strengths
Since our inception, our mission has been to help our RCFI customers succeed and strengthen the communities they serve. As a result, we have remained focused on designing and developing solutions that help them respond to the unique challenges they face. We believe our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to our RCFI customers stems from the following strengths:

• | Our purpose-built solutions lead the RCFI digital banking market: We build our solutions to address the unique challenges that RCFIs face in providing digital banking services. Our common platform was created to support the proliferation of mobile and tablet devices and the speed at which their use has become a common part of daily life. Our platform reduces the inefficiencies of traditional point-to-point integration strategies and replaces multiple management consoles with a single unified view of the rules, rights and security involved with operating seamlessly across digital channels. Our solutions enable our RCFI customers to provide a compelling, unified user experience to consumer and commercial account holders using a single login anywhere, anytime and on any device.


• | We have a proven track record in the markets we serve: Our founders and management have a track record of successfully building banking technology companies. In addition, our employees have deep domain expertise in financial services and community banking. We utilize this deep industry-specific experience to drive our continued growth and success.


• | Our customer acquisition model is focused and efficient: We focus our customer acquisition efforts on RCFIs. This market opportunity drives our targeted go-to-market strategy which allows us to effectively direct our sales and marketing efforts. Utilizing the deep industry experience of our management and sales teams, we are able to leverage our relationships with leaders and influencers at many RCFIs as valuable sources of reference and promotion. As a result, our sales professionals are typically able to identify opportunities early and often reduce sales cycle time.


• | We grow our customer relationships over time: Throughout our long-term customer relationships, we employ a structured strategy designed to inform, educate and enhance customer confidence and help our customers identify and implement additional solutions designed to benefit and grow their account holder bases.


• | Our revenues are highly predictable: We generally recognize our revenues over the terms of our customer agreements. The initial term of our Q2 platform customer agreements averages over five years, although it varies by customer. Our long-term agreements and our high customer retention, as well as the growth over time in the number of account holders using our solutions, drive the recurring nature of our revenues and provide us with significant visibility into future revenues. Furthermore, we believe our customer services model drives high retention rates and incremental sales of our solutions.


• | Our award-winning culture drives innovation and customer success: We believe our award-winning, innovation-focused culture and the location of our operations facilitate recruiting and retaining top development, integration and design talent. We are headquartered in Austin, Texas which is a vibrant city that continues to attract an increasing number of young professionals and has close ties to leading research institutions. In each of the past seven years, the Austin American Statesman recognized us as one of Austin's "Top Places to Work." Our mission, combined with our focus on delivering cloud-based digital banking solutions to RCFIs, continue to enable us to attract and retain top talent.

Our Growth Strategy
We intend to continue to expand our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to RCFIs. To accomplish this goal, we are pursuing the following growth strategies:

• | Further penetrate our large market opportunity: We believe RCFIs are increasingly adopting cloud-based digital banking solutions. Our current Q2 platform customers represent approximately 3% of the 11,420 federally-insured RCFIs in the U.S. with less than $50 billion in assets. We intend to further penetrate our large market opportunity and increase our number of RCFI customers through investments in our sales and marketing organization and related activities.

• | Grow revenues by expanding our relationships with existing customers: We believe there is significant opportunity to expand our relationships with existing customers by selling additional solutions such as Q2 Corporate and Q2 SMART. In addition, our revenues from existing customers continue to grow as these customers increase the number of account holders on our solutions and as the number of transactions these account holders perform on our solutions increases.


• | Continue to expand our solutions offerings and enhance our platform: We believe our history of innovation distinguishes us in the market, and we intend to continue to invest in our software development efforts and introduce new solutions that are largely informed by and aligned with the business objectives of our existing and new customers. For example, we added Q2 Corporate to our offerings, which is designed to support RCFIs in their efforts to attract and retain larger commercial accounts. Additionally, we successfully leveraged our common platform and integration capabilities which enabled us to derive rich analytics and build and deploy our Q2 Sentinel offering. We also introduced Q2 SMART, which utilizes machine learning and statistical analysis to unlock actionable customer insights to drive improved targeting, products, growth and revenue across channels. We plan to continue to expand our analytics capabilities and leverage the data generated on our platform to further support the strategic initiatives and growth of our existing and new customers. In June 2017, we introduced Q2 Open, a portfolio of open API financial services which are designed to allow RCFIs, as well as others wishing to provide innovative financial services, to develop and support their own applications and financial services technologies more quickly and effectively. Q2 Open additionally provides an opportunity for our RCFI customers to partner with financial technology companies in providing innovative financial services products to meet evolving consumer expectations.


• | Further develop our key association partner relationships: We establish key association partner relationships with industry-leading providers to optimize our go-to-market strategy and enhance the value of our platform. Our association partners typically inform, educate and connect RCFIs with the services and solutions required to deliver new and innovative technology to their account holders. We plan to leverage our association partner ecosystem and cultivate our key association partners, such as the American Banking Association, National Association for Federally Insured Credit Unions, Texas Bankers Association and Western Bankers Association, to increase the awareness of our solutions.


• | Selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments: In addition to continuing to develop our solutions organically, we regularly evaluate strategic opportunities, such as our acquisitions of Centrix and Smarty Pig, LLC, doing business as Social Money, or Social Money. We anticipate that we will continue to selectively pursue acquisitions of and strategic investments in businesses and technologies that will strengthen and expand the features and functionality of our solutions or provide access to new customers.

Q2 Corporate: Q2 Corporate is designed to support RCFIs in their efforts to attract and retain larger commercial accounts. Using Q2 Corporate, business accounts can more effectively manage higher volume and more complex transactions by restricting transactions based on accounts, subsidiaries, approval levels, user roles, date and time as well as geographic location. In addition, Q2 Corporate supports more advanced information reporting designed to help RCFIs deliver key business information to their commercial account holders.
Q2 SMART: Q2 SMART is an intelligent targeting and messaging platform that allows customers to analyze account holder data utilizing machine learning and statistical analysis to look for opportunities to grow their account holder relationships with targeted offerings based on specific account holder behavior. Q2 SMART relies on a multichannel approach, identifying traits across a broad range of account holder behavioral patterns to help customers create new account holder campaigns, conversations and offers based on specific account holder behaviors rather than just demographics. Q2 SMART includes a recommendation engine that uses the same analysis to determine which products an account holder is most likely to adopt. Q2 SMART is fully integrated with the Q2 platform and summarizes account holder behavioral data using clear and easily understood metrics, graphs and charts that are updated daily and presented through an intuitive user interface.
Q2 Account Opening: Q2 Account Opening provides RCFI customers with an intuitive, low-friction application for their account holders to set up checking and savings accounts online in a matter of minutes, with streamlined application forms and steps relative to traditional in-branch account opening processes. Q2 Account Opening also allows account holders to quickly fund their newly opened accounts using a credit or debit card. Q2 Account Opening is designed to function across devices giving financial institutions the ability to extend their market reach beyond their traditional geographic footprint.
Q2 Active/Active: Q2 operates multiple data centers, each of which contains the infrastructure required to maintain full load capacity for all account holders using Q2's platform solution. For all Q2 platform solution customers, all inbound traffic from digital banking logins and interactions are balanced equally among the two data centers, with account holders seamlessly directed to one data center or the other at login to ensure even sharing of online traffic. The Q2 Active/Active solution enhances this standard load balancing with application and storage resiliency to enhance performance and availability for RCFIs. The Q2 Active/Active solution keeps the databases in both centers in a mirrored state to allow for a fully automated failover that significantly minimizes recovery time and account holders affected. 
Q2 Patrol: Q2 Patrol is an event-driven validation product designed to mitigate certain high-risk, non-transactional fraudulent activity. Q2 Patrol utilizes behavioral machine learning to identify potentially fraudulent digital banking sessions. It analyzes past login behavior and device details, including IP addresses, geolocation, device type, time stamps and more to create a digital footprint for each account holder. This added layer of insight enhances security by: requiring account holders to further authenticate a digital banking session if that session is deemed suspect based on abnormal behavioral login and device detail; providing regular reporting to RCFIs for regulatory compliance and risk reduction; and supplying session details in the user interface to better involve account holders in their own account safety. 
Q2mobility App: Q2mobility App is our mobile and tablet digital banking solution. With Q2mobility App, consumer and commercial account holders can access, engage and complete banking transactions such as adding and managing payees, transferring funds, executing single or recurring payments for multiple bank accounts, viewing e-statements or check images and managing other general banking services from their Apple iOS or Android-enabled mobile or tablet device. Q2mobility App uses the native functionality of mobile and tablet devices such as touch, camera and geo-location to enhance the digital banking experience of account holders.
Q2mobile Remote Deposit Capture: Q2mobile Remote Deposit Capture is a partnered solution that allows remote check deposit capture utilizing account holders' camera-ready mobile and tablet devices.

Q2 CardSwap: Q2 CardSwap allows RCFI customers who issue debit or credit cards to enable account holders receiving newly issued cards to automatically change their payment information with existing subscription and digital point-of-sale services, which have previously been set up for payment with a different card, removing a traditionally significant barrier to card and account switching decisions by account holders. In addition to simplifying the account holder onboarding process, Q2 CardSwap can also be used to assist account holders with compromised card replacement.
Q2text: Q2text is our mobile solution designed to enable specific digital banking activities through the text messaging function of the device. Q2text provides self-service banking to account holders without the use of an app. Q2text enables account holders to check account balances, review transaction histories, transfer funds between accounts and manage alert and notification messaging to their mobile device.
Q2voice: Q2voice is our voice-based solution for telephones. With Q2voice account holders can use their traditional telephone or mobile phones to conduct voice banking such as checking account balances and transfers. Q2voice also enables our customers to provide alerts, notification, security and completion of an online initiated transaction to their account holders.

Centrix Exact/Transaction Management System (Exact/TMS):  Exact/TMS is a fraud prevention tool focused on the transaction management needs of our customers' corporate clients. It encompasses check positive pay with payee match, ACH positive pay and full account reconciliation.
In June 2017, we also introduced Q2 Open, a portfolio of open API financial services which are designed to allow RCFIs, as well as others wishing to provide innovative financial services, to develop and support their own applications and financial services technologies. Q2 Open additionally provides an opportunity for our RCFI customers to partner with financial technology companies in providing new innovative financial services technologies to meet evolving consumer expectations. Q2 Open is comprised of the following four services generally utilized through open APIs, which allow development-capable organizations to build front-end interfaces and experiences on top of the existing Q2 Open infrastructure:
Q2 Debit: Q2 Debit enables customers to develop applications which leverage federally insured checking accounts with branded debit cards integrated into Visa or MasterCard networks.
Q2 Save: Q2 Save allows customers to develop applications which utilize fully functional, compliant and cost-effective savings accounts with account and routing numbers.
Q2 Ledger: Q2 Ledger provides customers with ledgering functionality to support their applications leveraging "for the benefit of," or FBO, accounts, as an alternative to traditional checking and savings accounts. 
11

Q2 Biller Direct: Q2 Biller Direct provides customers with the ability to aggregate end users' bills and payments into a single view, enabling bill presentment, aggregation and bill pay functionality into the customers' applications. We also offer Q2 Biller Direct to our Q2 Platform customers as a bill payment solution integrated with the Q2 platform.
Implementation and Customer Support
We seek to deepen and grow our customer relationships by providing consistent, high-quality implementation and customer support services, which we believe drive higher customer retention and incremental sales opportunities within our existing customer base. We structure our implementation teams to effectively collaborate with the management and technology teams of our customers ensuring the rapid deployment and effective utilization of our solutions. Our implementation teams develop and execute a coordinated implementation plan for our customers centered around five key phases: initiation, configuration, application testing, limited production and production.
Our customer support personnel serve the comprehensive support-related needs of our customers. Due to the highly-regulated and complex nature of the financial services industry, our implementation and customer support service teams are aided by highly-trained, in-house resources who are knowledgeable about our solutions and the regulatory environment in which our customers operate.
Partner Offerings
The flexible nature of our common platform allows us to build rapid integrations with RCFIs' internal and third-party systems to support account holder activities and RCFI processes. Our ability to integrate with these systems enables our RCFI customers to offer a comprehensive set of consumer and commercial functionality to their account holders such as bill payment, personal finance management, online account opening and secure browsing while providing the RCFI a single view of the RCFI's activities and processes such as risk management, fraud detection and account reconciliation. This level of visibility enables our RCFI customers to evaluate the overall efficiency of their digital banking offerings.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organization is responsible for growing our customer base and maintaining and expanding relationships with our existing customers. We sell our solutions mainly through our direct sales organization. Our direct sales organization consists of experienced sales professionals who are organized based on several different criteria including geography, account size, type of financial institution and whether a prospect is a new or existing customer. Our sales representatives are supported by our solutions consulting and sales operations teams.
Our marketing team complements our sales organization through lead generation, brand building, analyst relations and industry research. Our primary target market of RCFIs is well-defined due to the regulatory classifications of financial institutions. We focus our marketing efforts on industry-specific tradeshows, publications and digital newsletters as well as referral agreements with strategic industry partners. Our marketing team also conducts primary research to support our industry thought leadership and to identify emerging trends in account holder behavior and digital banking activities. Our marketing programs primarily target RCFI technology, finance, operations and marketing executives as well as senior business leaders.
Research and Development
Our focus on innovation has fueled our growth and enables us to provide our customers unified cloud-based digital banking solutions built on a common platform. We allocate significant resources to developing and improving our platform, digital banking and other solutions to meet our customers' evolving needs. We monitor and test our solutions regularly, and we maintain a disciplined release process to enhance our existing solutions and introduce new capabilities without interrupting service delivery. We follow state-of-the-art practices in software development and design, including using modern programming languages, data storage systems and other tools. Our multi-tiered architecture enables us to scale, add and modify features quickly in response to changing market dynamics, customer needs and regulatory requirements. Our platform was engineered to support rapid development and deployment of new features to address RCFI needs in the market. We also enable RCFIs to address their market-specific needs via our extension and integration frameworks, which is a key aspect of our technology strategy. Workflows and features that we deliver include automated enrollment, product specific payment workflows, loan origination, "save-the-change" programs, targeted marketing and new account opening.
Our research and development expenses were $40.3 million, $32.5 million and $21.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Technology and Operations
Due to the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry, our digital banking platform combines both multi-tenant and single instance aspects. This structure is designed to maximize account holder data security and minimize compliance cost and risks. Our solutions utilize a multi-tiered architecture that allows for scalability, operational simplicity, security and disaster recovery. We have also developed an internal operations and analytics platform that aggregates and leverages customer instance and account holder experience captured within our solutions to drive future innovation and scale.
We serve our Q2 platform customers from two secure, third-party, American National Standards Institute Tier 4 data center facilities, one located in Carrollton, Texas and the other located in Austin, Texas. Both data centers are operated by the same third-party provider. A small portion of our solutions are hosted by cloud-based hosting services, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. We believe that our current data centers have sufficient capacity to meet our anticipated growth for the foreseeable future. Although we utilize a third party to manage our data center facilities for our Q2 platform solutions, we manage the hardware and software on which our Q2 platform solutions operate. We utilize industry standard hardware in resilient configurations to minimize service interruptions, and regularly consider and implement improvements to enhance the resiliency of our services, including our recent improvements to actively distribute services across both data centers. As a result of these improvements, our network infrastructure is fully redundant within each of our data centers, including network teaming to provide network redundancy that includes multiple upstream Internet connections. We have also purchased a private block of IP address space to simplify and expedite our disaster recovery management operations for our Q2 platform customers.
Our Q2 platform solutions have had average uptimes in excess of 99.9% since January 2013. We actively monitor our infrastructure 24x7 for any sign of failure, and we seek to take preemptive action to minimize and prevent downtime. Our data centers employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity and security, including redundant power from multiple substations and cooling systems, fire and flood prevention mechanisms, continual security coverage and biometric readers at entry points as well as perimeter boundary security measures. We have also implemented extensive disaster recovery measures and continue to invest in data center and other technical infrastructure.
All users are authenticated, authorized and validated before they can access our solutions. Users must have at a minimum, a valid user ID and associated password. Many of our customers also employ other authentication methods such as out-of-band one-time password delivery to log on to our platform solutions and hardware cryptographic tokens to authorize transactions. Our layered security model allows different groups of users to have different levels of access to our solutions. Our solutions' vulnerability is tested using internal tools prior to release, and an independent third-party performs penetration and vulnerability tests on our solutions periodically.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secrets and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. As of December 31, 2017, we had seven U.S. patent applications pending and two issued U.S. patents. Our issued patents, which expire in March 2028, relate to our intellectual property created to address technology integration challenges for community banks and credit unions. We use the software components and methods claimed in these patents to access the data from several different types of RCFIs and to allow us to deliver our online, mobile, tablet, voice and text solutions to their account holders without having to individually integrate each solution with each RCFI's data. Despite substantial investment in research and development activities, we have not focused on patents and patent applications historically. We license third-party technologies, such as bill pay technologies, that are incorporated into some of our solutions.
The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. It may be possible for other parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our solutions without authorization. Failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could significantly harm our competitive position and operating results.
Companies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and will likely in the future, receive notices that claim we have misappropriated or misused other parties' intellectual property rights. There may be intellectual property rights held by others, including issued or pending patents and trademarks that cover significant aspects of our solutions. Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management's attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using solutions found to be in violation of another party's rights. We might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop 
13

alternative non-infringing solutions, which could require significant effort and expense and which we may not be able to perform efficiently or at all. If we cannot license the intellectual property at issue or develop non-infringing solutions for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively.
Our Competition
The market for digital banking solutions is highly competitive. We compete with point solution vendors and core processing vendors, as well as internally developed solutions. We believe that our deep industry expertise, reputation for consistent, high-quality customer support and our comprehensive and unified cloud-based digital banking solutions that extend across online, mobile and voice channels and devices in a secure compliant manner distinguish us from the competition.
We currently compete with providers of technology and services in the financial services industry, including point system vendors and core processing vendors, as well as systems internally-developed by RCFIs. We have a number of point system competitors, including NCR Corporation, First Data Corporation, D3 Technology, Inc., and Alkami Technology, Inc. in the online, consumer and small business banking space and Finastra (formerly D+H Corporation), ACI Worldwide, Inc., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., or FIS, and Bottomline Technologies (de), Inc. in the commercial banking space. We also compete with core processing vendors that provide systems and services such as Fiserv, Inc., Jack Henry and Associates, Inc. and FIS. Many of our competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, may devote greater resources to the promotion, sale and support of their systems than we can, have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have and have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, many of our competitors expend more funds on research and development.
Although we compete with point system vendors and core processing vendors, we also partner with some of these vendors for certain data and services utilized in our solutions and receive referrals from them. In addition, certain RCFIs have or can obtain the ability to create their own in-house systems, and while many of these systems have difficulties scaling and providing an integrated platform, we still face challenges displacing in-house systems and retaining customers that choose to develop an in-house system.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the digital banking services market include the following:

• | alignment with the mission of the RCFIs;


• | ability to provide a single platform for consumer and commercial account holders;


• | functionality across online, mobile and voice channels;


• | cloud-based technology platform and pricing model;


• | ability to quickly integrate with third-party applications and systems;


• | ease of use of the interface, view and login to digital banking services across channels;


• | design of the account holder experience, including modern, intuitive and touch-centric features;


• | configurability and RCFI branding capabilities;


• | familiarity of workflows and terminology and feature-on-demand functionality;


• | integrated multi-layered security and compliance of solutions with regulatory requirements;


• | quality of implementation, integration and support services;


• | domain expertise and innovation in banking technology;


• | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly; and


• | rate of development, deployment and enhancement of software.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors within the RCFI market for digital banking solutions, but we expect competition to continue and increase as existing competitors continue to evolve their offerings and as new companies enter our market. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources and have greater flexibility in bundling and pricing competing solutions. To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing, customer support and our business operations generally.

Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 844 employees, all of which are located in the U.S. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement.
Culture
Since our inception, our culture has been rooted in our mission to help our RCFI customers be more successful and better serve their communities. We believe our passion, dedication and commitment towards this mission is a significant differentiator for us with RCFIs and our employees. We share our culture through our customer interactions, employee functions and collaborative and educational customer events like our CONNECT client conference, user groups and collaborate focus groups. In each of the past seven years, the Austin American Statesman recognized us as one of Austin's "Top Places to Work."
Presented with regular opportunities to help our customers more successfully compete and grow, we seek out ways to enhance our culture and our ability to make a difference for our customers and their account holders and end users. Our culture is visible across our organization and highlighted through a host of initiatives, programs and committees including the following:

• | our employee committees focused on culture, wellness, environmental and charitable causes and communications help create opportunities for employees to come together around important causes to make a difference in the work place and local communities;


• | our emerging leaders management training program identifies and cultivates new and emerging leadership talent within our organization; and


• | our flexible work spaces promote a collaborative, high-energy work environment and help facilitate team-based problem solving and cross-departmental learning.

Government Regulation
As a technology service provider to banks and credit unions, we are not required to be chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise our customers and other providers of financial services.
Our customers and prospects are subject to extensive and complex regulations and oversight by federal and state regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and affect the conduct of our customers' operations and, as a result, our business. Our solutions must enable our customers to comply with applicable requirements such as the following:

• | Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act;


• | the Electronic Funds Transfer Act;


• | Mobile Banking Guidance


• | the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act;


• | federal and state usury laws;


• | the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act;


• | laws against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices;


• | the Privacy of Consumer Financial Information regulations;


• | the Guidance on Supervision of Technology Services Providers promulgated by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, or FFIEC;


• | the Guidance on Outsourcing Technology Services promulgated by the FFIEC; and


• | other state and local laws and regulations.

15

We are subject to periodic examination by banking regulators under the authority of the FFIEC under its Guidance on the Supervision of Technology Services Providers and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, and other federal and state laws that apply to technology service providers as a result of the services we provide to the institutions they regulate. As an independent technology service provider, we are examined by federal financial regulators on a rotating basis. These examinations are based on guidance from the FFIEC, which is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards and report forms for the examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. The examinations cover a wide variety of subjects, including our management, acquisition and development activities, support and delivery, IT audits, as well as our disaster preparedness and business recovery planning. The banking regulators that make up the FFIEC have broad supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in an examination. Following an examination, our financial institutions customers may request an executive summary of the examination through their lead examination agency.
The Dodd-Frank Act granted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, authority to promulgate rules and interpret certain federal consumer financial protection laws, some of which apply to the solutions we offer. In certain circumstances, the CFPB also has examination and supervision powers with respect to service providers who provide a material service to a financial institution offering consumer financial products and services.
The compliance of our solutions with these requirements depends on a variety of factors, including the functionality and design of our solutions, the classification of our customers, and the manner in which our customers and their account holders utilize our solutions. For example, we are subject to the privacy and confidentiality provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations. In order to comply with our obligations under these laws, we are required to implement operating policies and procedures to protect the privacy and security of our customers' and their account holders' information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations.
