Item 1. Business
HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 30, 2017, originally under the name GigeTech, Inc. On October 31, 2017, the Company changed its name to OBITX, Inc. On May 23, 2021, the Company changed its name to Everything Blockchain, Inc. The Company is headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida.

The Company’s original business was to provide computer related services. The Company developed and acquired Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals. We published and generated textual, audio, and/or video content on the Internet, and operated websites that used a search engine to generate and maintain extensive databases of internet addresses and content. The Company discontinued this line of operations on April 17, 2020.

The Company is now primarily engaged in the business of consulting and developing blockchain and cybersecurity related solutions. Our technology platform provides the building blocks to power blockchain-related applications for organizations seeking to tap into the benefits of blockchain to solve critical business issues. Our patent--pending advances in blockchain engineering deliver the essential elements needed for real-world business use: speed, security, and energy efficiency. Currently, our lines of business are EB Advise, EB Build and EB Control.

On June 21, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interests of 832. 832, which is located in Texas, has developed many innovations in the areas of distributed computing, artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies. 

On June 30, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interests of Mercury. We have utilized Mercury, which is located in Idaho, as our hosting solution since May 2020. The Company, with Mercury, launched its mining operations in the western United States. We have commenced mining for Bitcoin. 

On July 31, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interests of Vengar. Vengar, which is located in Florida, has developed a zero-trust data access and protection software that the Company plans to integrate into its blockchain solutions.

We were not profitable and had incurred losses since our inception through January 31, 2021. Though 2022 resulted in net income, losses could reoccur and increase as we continue to work to develop our business. The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on being able to raise the necessary funding to continue operations, through the exercise of warrants, issuance of shares to the public, debt financings, joint arrangements and other contractual arrangements, or being able to operate profitably in the future. These consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments or reclassifications which would be necessary if the Company were unable to continue its operations in the normal course of business.

OVERVIEW OF INDUSTRY 

A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the collusion of the network. The blockchain system has been designed to use nodes agreement to order transactions and prevent fraud so that records cannot be altered retroactively. The network orders transactions by putting them together into groups called blocks, each block contains a definite number of transactions and a link to the previous block. Bitcoin, which is the name of the best-known cryptocurrency, is the one for which blockchain technology was invented. Blockchain is, quite simply, a digital, decentralized ledger that keeps a record of all transactions that take place across a peer-to-peer network.

Bitcoins are not the only type of digital assets founded on math-based algorithms and cryptographic security, although it is considered the most prominent as of the date of this filing. Almost 10,000 other Digital Assets, (commonly referred to as “altcoins”, “tokens”, “protocol tokens”, or “digital assets”), have been developed since the Bitcoin Network’s inception, including Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash, and HEX.

Blockchain Technologies

Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrency is an encrypted decentralized digital currency transferred between peers and confirmed in a public ledger via a process known as mining. As of January 31, 2022, the total value of all cryptocurrencies exceeds one trillion dollars.
Blockchain Value
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are not a fiat currency (i.e., a currency that is backed by a central bank or a national, supra-national or quasi-national organization) and is not backed by hard assets or other credit. As a result, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined by the value that various market participants place on them through their transactions.
Exchange Valuation
Due to the peer-to-peer framework of cryptocurrencies, transferors and recipients of cryptocurrencies are able to determine the value of the cryptocurrency transferred by mutual agreement or barter with respect to their transactions. As a result, the most common means of determining the value of a cryptocurrency is by surveying one or more exchanges where the cryptocurrency is publicly bought, sold and traded.

Zero Trust Technologies

Traditionally, networks were protected via a “castle and moat” approach. Essentially, a perimeter was built around a network through a variety of technologies and static policies such that if a user was inside the perimeter, they were deemed to be trustworthy. However, digital transformation, cloud adoption and remote working have eliminated the traditional notion of a network perimeter, or edge, breaking the legacy architecture of a perimeter-based security model.

The notion of “zero trust” access was created wherein security policy is applied based on context established through least-privileged access controls and strict user authentication, not assumed trust. Key principles of zero trust include:


· | Micro-segmentation of the network: Micro-perimeters are created around key network resources requiring authentication for access across each perimeter.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Multi-factor authentication: Validation of user identity from multiple simultaneous sources. 
· | Least-privilege access/authorization: Granting of the least level of user privilege and usage rights necessary to accomplish the user’s purpose. 


Much effort has been focused on zero trust network access, or ZTNA, where zero trust concepts and technologies have been used to secure access to networks and network resources. More recently zero trust is being applied more atomically to data access, or ZTDA, with solutions such as the Company’s EB Control.

Uses of Cryptocurrencies

Global Cryptocurrency Market

Global trade in cryptocurrencies consists of individual end user-to-end user transactions, together with facilitated exchange-based trading. There is currently no reliable data on the total number or demographic composition of users on the global exchanges.
Goods and Services

Cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase goods and services, either online or at physical locations, although reliable data is not readily available about the retail and commercial market penetration of the various cryptocurrencies. To date, the rate of consumer adoption and use of cryptocurrencies for paying merchants has trailed the broad expansion of retail and commercial acceptance of cryptocurrency. Other markets, such as credit card companies and certain financial institutions are not accepting such digital assets. It is likely that there will be a strong correlation between the continued expansion of the Cryptocurrency Network and its retail and commercial market penetration.
Anonymity and Illicit Use

The Blockchain Network was not designed to ensure the anonymity of users, despite a common misperception to the contrary. All transactions are logged on the Blockchain and any individual or government can trace the flow of cryptocurrencies from one address to another. Off-Blockchain transactions occurring off the Network are not recorded and do not represent actual transactions or the transfer of cryptocurrencies from one digital wallet address to another, though information regarding participants in an Off-Blockchain transaction may be recorded by the parties facilitating such Off-Blockchain transactions. Digital wallet addresses are randomized sequences of 27-34 alphanumeric characters that, standing alone, do not provide sufficient information to identify users; however, various methods may be used to connect an address to a particular user’s identity, including, among other things, simple Internet searching, electronic surveillance and statistical network analysis and data mining. Anonymity is also reduced to the extent that certain Exchanges and other service providers collect users’ personal information, because such Exchanges and service providers may be required to produce users’ information in order to comply with legal requirements. In many cases, a user’s own activity on the Blockchain Network or on Internet forums may reveal information about the user’s identity.

Users may take certain precautions to enhance the likelihood that they and their transactions will remain anonymous. For instance, a user may send its cryptocurrencies to different addresses multiple times to make tracking the cryptocurrencies through the Blockchain more difficult or, more simply, engage a so-called “mixing” or “tumbling” service to switch its cryptocurrencies with those of other users. However, these precautions do not guarantee anonymity and are illegal to the extent that they constitute money laundering or otherwise violate the law.

As with any other asset or medium of exchange, cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase illegal goods or fund illicit activities. The use of cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes, however, is not promoted by the Blockchain Network or the user community as a whole. Furthermore, we do not believe our advertising, marketing, and consulting services has exposure to such uses because the services we provide are curated by our management and team.

OVERVIEW OF COMPANY

EB Advise

EB Advise helps clients explore all aspects of blockchain to build solutions designed to deliver value. Through architecture, digital design, and development, we serve our clients in their search for innovative blockchain solutions that are ready for the market and address real business problems. Our objective is to focus on EB Advise projects that will result in recurring revenue or potential backend revenue that is a substantial multiple of the initial project value.

EB Build

EB Build is our patent pending blockchain platform that is the backbone of EBI’s blockchain and zero trust ecosystem. EB Build can be thought of as the foundation upon which we will build applications.

Unlike traditional blockchains, EB Build is “queryable” and uses a proprietary consensus algorithm. These advances offer advantages over tradition approaches such as allowing data to be added and retrieved to the chain in real-time and opens us to a larger pool of potential business use cases such as the ability to store data from internet of things, or IoT, devices.

An example of this is EB Build for environmental, social, and governance, or ESG. This application receives data from sensors in real time that are monitoring greenhouse gas emissions from equipment involved with the production of oil and gas. Clients can then prove emissions are within prescribed limits and use the data for forecasting, as well. Development of additional solutions for various markets and customer use cases is underway and we continue to build our EB Build ecosystem.

EB Control

EB Control is a Zero Trust Data Access solution for individuals and organizations seeking continuous control of their data across its lifespan. With data protected through an end-to-end zero-knowledge encryption architecture, only the creator of the data can grant permission for others to view their files and other data. EB Control allows our customers to:


· | Confidently know that their data will remain private when passed onto someone else 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Control who can access their data, and when and where they can access it. 
· | Determine what others can do with the data, including view only, forward/no forward, copy, print and save.
· | Update or revoke access at any time. 


Licensing of the EB Control engine to technology partners has already begun. Launch to the general market is expected during the quarter ending July 31, 2022. Integration with EB Build is planned for later this year.

Patents

The Company, through Vengar and 832, have filed patent applications for four patent families in the United States with 12 international patent filings. The patents relate to our zero-trust data access and protection software, and our blockchain technology. While the Company is in the process of filing multiple additional patents for the protection of its intellectual property, the following list provides reference to our current intellectual property patents:

RISK FACTORS

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained herein, including our financial statements and the related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.
General Risks

We have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability; we have recently shifted our focus to our blockchain and cryptocurrency business, and we may not be successful in this business.

We were not profitable and had incurred losses since our inception through January 31, 2021. Though 2022 resulted in net income, losses could reoccur and increase as we continue to work to develop our business. We were previously engaged in internet marketing and social media advertising. In late 2019, we determined to instead pursue a blockchain and cryptocurrency related business. Our current strategy in blockchain and cryptocurrency, like our prior ones, may not be successful. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.

We may be unable to raise additional capital needed to grow our business.

We may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could impair our growth and adversely affect our existing operations. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and the per share value of our common stock could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of debt likely would have priority over the holders of common stock on order of payment preference. We may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, take other actions including terms that require us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios that could otherwise not be in the interests of our stockholders.

We have an evolving business model which is subject to various uncertainties.

As cryptocurrency assets and blockchain technologies become more widely available, we expect the services and products associated with them to evolve. In order to stay current with the industry, our business model may need to evolve as well. From time to time, we may modify aspects of our business model relating to our strategy. We cannot offer any assurance that these or any other modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to our business. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. Further, we cannot provide any assurance that we will successfully identify all emerging trends and growth opportunities in this business sector, and we may lose out on those opportunities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.

We may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures, or acquire other companies or businesses that could negatively affect our operating results, dilute our stockholders’ ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense; notwithstanding the foregoing, our growth may depend on our success in uncovering and completing such transactions.

We are actively considering strategic opportunities with the support of our external advisors and consultants of various types; however, we cannot offer any assurance that acquisitions of businesses, assets, and/or entering into strategic alliances or joint ventures will be successful. We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates and may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into the existing business and could assume unknown or contingent liabilities.

Any future acquisitions also could result in the issuance of stock, incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or future write-offs of intangible assets or goodwill, any of which could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Integration of an acquired company may also disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that otherwise would be focused on developing and expanding our existing business. We may experience losses related to potential investments in other companies, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, strategic alliance, or joint venture if such investments do not materialize.

To finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue shares of common stock, preferred stock or a combination of debt and equity as consideration, which could significantly dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders or provide rights to such preferred stockholders in priority over our common stockholders. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using stock as consideration.

We may not be able to compete with other companies, some of whom have greater resources and experience.

We may not be able to compete successfully against present or future competitors. The cryptocurrency industry has attracted various high-profile and well-established operators, some of which have substantially greater liquidity and financial resources than we do. We may experience great difficulties in expanding and improving our network of computers to remain competitive. Competition from existing and future competitors that have access to more competitively priced resources could result in our inability to secure acquisitions and partnerships that we may need to expand our business in the future. This competition from other entities with greater resources, experience and reputation may result in our failure to maintain or expand our business, as we may never be able to successfully thrive in the already established market. If we are unable to expand and remain competitive, our business could be negatively affected which would have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities.


10


Our loss of any of our management team, our inability to execute an effective succession plan, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business.

Our success and future growth will depend to a significant degree on the skills and services of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. We will need to continue to grow our management in order to alleviate pressure on our existing team and in order to continue to develop our business. If our management fails to work together effectively, and/or execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, if we fail to execute an effective contingency or succession plan with the loss of any member of management, the loss of such management personnel may significantly disrupt our business.

We incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies; if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation.

As a public reporting company, we are required to, among other things, maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Substantial work will continue to be required to further implement, document, assess, test and remediate our system of internal controls. 

If our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, we may be unable to issue our financial statements in a timely manner, we may be unable to obtain the required audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm in a timely manner or we may be otherwise unable to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Consequently, our common stock listing on the OTC markets could be suspended or terminated, and our stock price could materially suffer. 

Our insurance may by inadequate to cover existing and future claims against the Company and our ability to pay for such claims may be limited, which may adversely affect our business.

If our existing insurance policies expire or are otherwise inadequate to cover liabilities and claims for indemnification, we may be required to pay for liabilities directly, which could negatively affect our liquidity. To the extent we are required to pay for liabilities directly, our available cash reserves will be affected, which may affect our ability to respond to market conditions and to pay for other emergent expenses, which could negatively affect the results of our operations and our business.


11


We face risks related to the novel Coronavirus, or COVID-19, outbreak, which could significantly disrupt our operations and financial results.

Our business may be adversely impacted by the effects of COVID-19. In addition to global macroeconomic effects, the COVID-19 outbreak and any other related adverse public health developments may cause disruption to the productivity of our suppliers and personnel, foreign and domestic.

The COVID-19 or other disease outbreak may over a longer term, adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that may adversely affect demand for our products and services which would impact our operating results. The continued spread of COVID-19 or the occurrence of other epidemics and the imposition of related public health measures and travel and business restrictions may adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we have experienced and may further experience disruptions to our business operations resulting from quarantines, self-isolations, or other movement and restrictions on the ability of our employees to perform their jobs.

If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, or if events occur that damage our reputation and brands, our ability to expand our base of customers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.

We believe that our brands have significantly contributed to and will continue to contribute to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our customer base. Many of our customers are referred by existing customers. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products and services, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that customers do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding cryptocurrencies, user privacy, and other issues, which may adversely affect our reputation and brands. We also may fail to provide adequate customer service, which could erode confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of customers that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other customers, by the actions of customers acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related and law enforcement purposes, or by the use of our products or services for illicit, objectionable, or illegal ends. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.

We make product, service, and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results.

We frequently make product, service and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and improve our financial performance over the long term. We may introduce changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that direct our customers away from our current products. We are also investing in new products and services, and we may not successfully monetize such experiences. We also may take steps that result in limiting distribution of products and services in the short term in order to attempt to ensure the availability of our products and services to users over the long term. These decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our customer growth and our business results of operations could be harmed.

Our new services and changes to existing services could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits.

Our ability to retain, increase, and engage our customer base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing services and to create successful new services, both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. If new or enhanced products fail to engage our customers, or if we are unsuccessful in our monetization efforts, we may fail to attract or retain customers or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.


12


We face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against any of our competitors, some of whom have far greater resources, capital, experience, market penetration, sales and distribution channels than us. If our major competitors were, for example, to significantly increase the level of price discounts offered to consumers, we could respond by offering price discounts, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In social media, we compete with companies that sell advertising, as well as with companies that provide social and communication products and services that are designed to engage users and capture time spent on mobile devices and online. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including from companies that facilitate communication and the sharing of content and information, companies that enable marketers to display advertising, and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers. We compete with companies that offer services across broad platforms that replicate capabilities we provide. We also compete with companies that develop applications, particularly mobile applications, that provide social or other communications functionality, such as messaging, photo and video-sharing, and micro-blogging, as well as companies that provide regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries. In addition, we face competition from traditional, online, and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns.

Some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or better competitive positions in certain service segments, geographic regions or user demographics than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some of our users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some of our users have reduced their use of and engagement with our service in favor of these other products and services.

In the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services, we may not experience the anticipated growth, or see a decline, in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.

Our competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies.

We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:


· | the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our services compared to our competitors’ services; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the size and composition of our user base; 
· | the engagement of our users with our services and competing services; 
· | the timing and market acceptance of services, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors’ services; 
· | our ability to distribute our services to new and existing users; 
· | our ability to monetize our services; 
· | the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors; 
· | customer service and support efforts; 
· | marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their investments; 
· | our ability to establish and maintain developer’s’ interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other services; 
· | our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with Facebook and our other services; 
· | changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, including settlements and consent decrees, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;
· | acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors; 
· | our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and service managers; 
· | our ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and 
· | our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors 


13


If we are not able to compete effectively, our user base and level of user engagement may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

We expect that new products and/or brands we develop will expose us to risks that may be difficult to identify until such products and/or brands are commercially available.

We are currently developing, and in the future, will continue to develop, new products and brands, the risks of which will be difficult to ascertain until these products and/or brands are commercially available. For example, we are developing new products and distribution channels. Any negative events or results that may arise as we develop new products or brands may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Internet security poses a risk to our products and services.

We manage our websites and E-commerce platform internally and as a result, any compromise of our security or misappropriation of proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure Internet transmission of confidential information, such as credit and other proprietary information.

Internet security poses a risk on business operations and management budgets.

Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect client transaction data. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause material interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to minimize problems caused by security breaches. To the extent that our activities or the activities of others involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss and/or litigation. Our security measures may not prevent security breaches. Our failure to prevent these security breaches may result in consumer distrust and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Currently, we are lacking diversification of revenues.

Our business will depend upon entering into agreements with customers to use our services and software solutions, as well as our consulting services.

User license fees from our customers from the use of these services will provide all or substantially all of our revenues. We can give no assurance that our current and potential customers, including data service providers that provide broadband service to end users, government agencies or entities with private data networks, will license or will agree to pay the license fees we will request. The failure to enter into those agreements or realize the anticipated benefits from these agreements on a timely basis, or at all, or to renew any agreements upon expiration or termination would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Increased costs and other demands associated with our growth could impact our ability to achieve profitability over the long term and could strain our personnel, technology and infrastructure resources.

We expect our costs to increase in future periods as we experience growth in our personnel and operations, which will place significant demands on our management, administrative, technological, operational and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to contain costs with respect to growth opportunities. To successfully manage our potential growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, technological and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. In addition, as and when we grow, we will need to effectively integrate, develop and motivate new employees. Our failure to successfully manage our growth could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The industry within which we compete is highly competitive, which may hinder our ability to generate revenue and may diminish our margins.

The technology and media focused advertising industry within which we will compete is highly competitive. New developments in technology may negatively affect the development or licensing of proprietary software or make our proprietary software uncompetitive or obsolete. Some of our competitors may be much larger companies with longer operating histories and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do, as well as greater name recognition. As a result, our competitors may be able to compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Each of these competitors has the potential to capture market share in various markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our position in the industry and our financial results

We cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our expected growth.

The growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relations with customers and other third parties. In the event of continued growth of our operations or in the number of our third-party relationships, our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial, and management processes and systems and to effectively expand, train, and manage our employee base. As our organization continues to grow, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.

We intend to have significant international operations expanding our operations abroad where we have limited operating experience, and this may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results.

We intend to expand our business operations into international markets. We may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our services. Our services are generally available globally through the web and on mobile, but some or all of our services or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities. We may also outsource certain operational functions to third-party vendors globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, many of which are beyond our control.

Cryptocurrency-Related Risks

Because cryptocurrencies may be determined to be investment securities, we may inadvertently violate the Investment Company Act and incur large losses as a result and potentially be required to register as an investment company or terminate operations and we may incur third party liabilities.

We believe that we are not engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourselves out as being engaged in those activities. However, under the Investment Company Act a company may be deemed an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(C) thereof if the value of its investment securities is more than 40% of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.


15


As a result of our investments, including investments in which we do not have a controlling interest, the investment securities we hold could exceed 40% of our total assets, exclusive of cash items and, accordingly, we could determine that we have become an inadvertent investment company. The cryptocurrencies we own or have acquired may be deemed an investment security by the SEC, although we do not believe any of the cryptocurrencies we own or have acquired are securities. An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can rely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent investment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (a) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the issuer’s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (b) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. As of January 31, 2022, we do not believe we are an inadvertent investment company, however, resolution of pending public comments from the SEC have not been concluded. For us, any grace period would be unknown until these issues are resolved or the SEC issues rules and regulations concerning cryptocurrency treatment. We may take actions to cause the investment securities held by us to be less than 40% of our total assets, or, in the alternative, we may seek a no-action letter from the SEC if we are unable to acquire sufficient assets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner.

As the Rule 3a-2 exception is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available to us, we would have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after we cease being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit our ability to make certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on our earnings. In any event, we do not intend to become an investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.

Classification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to register, it would have to stop doing business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would require a restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could do as a registered investment company. Further, we would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would need to file reports under the Investment Company Act. The cost of such compliance would result in the Company incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required would have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations.

We may lose our private key to our digital wallet, destroying all of our cryptocurrency assets.

Cryptocurrencies are stored in a digital wallet and are controllable by the processor of both the public key and the private key relating to the digital wallet in which the cryptocurrencies are held, both of which are unique. If the private key is lost, destroyed, or otherwise compromised, we may be unable to access our cryptocurrencies held in the related digital wallet, which will essentially be lost. If the private key is acquired by a third party, then this third party may be able to gain access to our cryptocurrencies.

We rely on third party service providers to exchange our cryptocurrencies who may be at risks to cyber-security and malicious activity.

Trading platforms and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to hacking or other malicious activities which we cannot control. If one or more malicious actor(s) obtains control of sufficient consensus nodes on the Blockchain, or, other means of alteration, then a Blockchain may be altered. While the Blockchain is decentralized, there is increasing evidence of concentration and techniques that may increase the risk that one or several bad actors could control the Blockchain on which we conduct business.

Cryptocurrencies may be traded on numerous online platforms, through third party service providers and as peer-to-peer transactions between parties. Many marketplaces simply bring together counterparties without providing any clearing or intermediary services and without being regulated. In such cases, we assume all risks.

Cryptocurrency trading platforms, largely unregulated and providing only limited transparency with respect to their operations, have come under increasing scrutiny due to cases of fraud, business failure or security breaches, where, even when insured, we may not be compensated for losses caused by such activities. Although we do not need a trading platform or an exchange to trade cryptocurrencies, such platforms are often used to convert fiat currency into cryptocurrency or to trade one cryptocurrency for another.


16


Regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects or operations.

As cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies; certain governments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Ongoing and future regulatory actions may impact our ability to continue to operate, and such actions could affect our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.

The development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of and transactions in cryptocurrencies is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.

The use of cryptocurrencies to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services and complete transactions, is part of a new and rapidly evolving industry that employs cryptocurrency assets based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. Large-scale acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment has not, and may never, occur. The growth of this industry in general, and the use of cryptocurrencies in particular, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and the slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of developing protocols may occur unpredictably. The factors include, but are not limited to:


· | continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies as a medium to exchange;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | governmental and quasi-governmental regulation of cryptocurrencies and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the network or similar cryptocurrency systems;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the network; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the increased consolidation of contributors to the bitcoin blockchain through mining pools;


· | the use of the networks supporting cryptocurrencies for developing smart contracts and distributed applications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | negative consumer sentiment and perception of bitcoin specifically and cryptocurrencies generally.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The outcome of these factors could have negative effects on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.


17


Banks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities or that accept cryptocurrencies as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our securities.

A number of companies that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions in response to government action where regulatory response to cryptocurrencies has been to exclude their use for ordinary consumer transactions. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for our business. The difficulty that many businesses that provide cryptocurrency-related services have and may continue to have in finding banks and financial institutions willing to provide them services may be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and harming public perception of cryptocurrencies, and could decrease their usefulness and harm their public perception in the future. 

The usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and the public perception of cryptocurrencies could be damaged if banks or financial institutions were to close the accounts of businesses engaging in cryptocurrency-related activities. This could occur as a result of compliance risk, cost, government regulation or public pressure. The risk applies to securities firms, clearance and settlement firms, national stock and derivatives on commodities exchanges, the over-the-counter market, and the Depository Trust Company, which, if any of such entities adopts or implements similar policies, rules or regulations, could negatively affect our relationships with financial institutions and impede our ability to convert cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies. Such factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and harm investors.

The impact of geopolitical and economic events on the supply and demand for cryptocurrencies is uncertain.

Geopolitical crises may motivate large-scale purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which could increase the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rapidly. This may increase the likelihood of a subsequent price decrease as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, adversely affecting the value of our inventory following such downward adjustment. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in general uncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold. Alternatively, as an emerging asset class with limited acceptance as a payment system or commodity, global crises and general economic downturn may discourage investment in cryptocurrencies as investors focus their investment on less volatile asset classes as a means of hedging their investment risk.

As an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, cryptocurrencies, which are relatively new, are more sensitive to the concept of supply and demand. How such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events is largely uncertain, but could be harmful to us and investors in our common stock. Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of cryptocurrencies either globally or locally. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.

Acceptance and/or widespread use of cryptocurrency is uncertain.

Currently, there is a relatively limited use of any cryptocurrency in the retail and commercial marketplace, thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect an investment in our securities. Some financial institutions may refuse to process funds for cryptocurrency transactions, process wire transfers to or from cryptocurrency exchanges, or maintain accounts for persons or entities transacting in cryptocurrency. Conversely, a significant portion of cryptocurrency demand is generated by investors seeking a long-term store of value or speculators seeking to profit from the short-term holding of an asset. Price volatility undermines cryptocurrency’s role as a medium of exchange, as retailers are much less likely to accept it as a form of payment. Market capitalization for a cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange and payment method may always be minimal.


18


The relative lack of acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the retail and commercial marketplace, or a reduction of such use, limits the ability of end users to use them to pay for goods and services. Such lack of acceptance or decline in acceptances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we acquire or hold for our own account.

Transactional fees may decrease demand for cryptocurrency and prevent expansion.

As the number of currency rewards awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, the incentive for miners to continue to contribute to the network may transition from a set reward to transaction fees. 

In order to incentivize miners to continue to contribute to the network, the network may either formally or informally transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving a block. This transition could be accomplished by miners independently electing to record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a transaction fee. If transaction fees paid for cryptocurrency transactions become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment, and existing users may be motivated to switch back to fiat currency. Either the requirement from miners of higher transaction fees in exchange for recording transactions in a blockchain, or a software upgrade that automatically charges fees for all transactions, may decrease demand for cryptocurrencies and prevent the expansion of the network to retail merchants and commercial businesses, resulting in a reduction in the price of cryptocurrencies, which would adversely impact our investment portfolio. Decreased use and demand for cryptocurrency may adversely affect the overall value and result in a reduction in the price of various cryptocurrencies, which would in turn decrease the value of our common stock.

The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business.

The decentralized nature of the governance of cryptocurrency systems may lead to ineffective decision making that slows development or prevents a network from overcoming emergent obstacles. Governance of many cryptocurrency systems is by voluntary consensus and open competition with no clear leadership structure or authority. To the extent the lack of clarity in corporate governance of cryptocurrency systems leads to ineffective decision making that slows development and growth of such cryptocurrencies, the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.

It may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoin, ether, or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize similar cryptocurrency assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which would adversely affect us.

Although currently cryptocurrencies generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, one or more countries that have taken harsh regulatory action in recent months, may take regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use these cryptocurrency assets or to exchange for fiat currency. In many nations, it is illegal to accept payment in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions, and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrencies. Such restrictions may adversely affect us as the large-scale use of cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange is presently confined to certain regions globally. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and harm investors. 


19


There is a lack of liquid markets, and possible manipulation of blockchain/cryptocurrency-based assets.

Cryptocurrencies that are represented and trade on a ledger-based platform may not necessarily benefit from viable trading markets. Stock exchanges have listing requirements and vet issuers, requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules which monitor investors transacting on such platforms for fraud and other improprieties. These conditions may not necessarily be replicated on a distributed ledger platform, depending on the platform’s controls and policies. The more lenient a distributed ledger platform is about vetting issuers of cryptocurrency assets or users that transact on the platform, the higher the potential risk for fraud or manipulation of the ledger due to a controlled event. These factors may decrease liquidity or volume or may otherwise increase volatility of investment securities or other assets trading on a ledger-based system, which may adversely affect us. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and harm investors.

Our operations, investment strategies and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in cryptocurrencies.

We compete with other users and/or companies that acquire and strategically use cryptocurrencies and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed by or linked to cryptocurrencies through entities similar to us. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrencies directly, which could limit the market for our shares and reduce their liquidity. The emergence of other financial vehicles and exchange-traded funds have been scrutinized by regulators and such scrutiny and the negative impressions or conclusions resulting from such scrutiny could be applicable to us and impact our ability to successfully pursue our new strategy or operate at all, or to establish or maintain a public market for our securities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.

The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or other alternatives.

The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or an alternative to distributed ledgers altogether. Our business utilizes presently existent digital ledgers and blockchains and we could face difficulty adapting to emergent digital ledgers, blockchains, or alternatives thereto. This may adversely affect us and our exposure to various blockchain technologies and prevent us from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.

Our cryptocurrencies may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access.

There is a risk that some or all of our cryptocurrencies could be lost or stolen. Cryptocurrencies are stored in cryptocurrency sites commonly referred to as “wallets” by holders of cryptocurrencies which may be accessed to exchange a holder’s cryptocurrency assets. Access to our cryptocurrency assets could also be restricted by cybercrime (such as a denial of service attack) against a service at which we maintain a hosted hot wallet. A hot wallet refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the Internet. Generally, hot wallets are easier to set up and access then wallets in cold storage, but they are also more susceptible to hackers and other technical vulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold storage is generally more secure than hot storage, but it is not ideal for quick or regular transactions and we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of our cryptocurrency assets. We hold all of our cryptocurrencies in cold storage to reduce the risk of malfeasance, but the risk of loss of our cryptocurrency assets cannot be wholly eliminated.

Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure cryptocurrencies, such as by attacking the cryptocurrency network source code, exchange miners, third-party platforms, cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of one of the more substantial holdings of cryptocurrency. As we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments and profitability. The loss or destruction of a private key required to access our digital wallets may be irreversible and we may be denied access for all time to our cryptocurrency holdings or the holdings of others held in those compromised wallets. Our loss of access to our private keys or our experience of a data loss relating to our digital wallets could adversely affect our investments and assets.


20


Cryptocurrencies are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which they are held, which wallet’s public key or address is reflected in the network’s public blockchain. We will publish the public key relating to digital wallets in use when we verify the receipt of transfers and disseminate such information into the network, but we will need to safeguard the private keys relating to such digital wallets. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our cryptocurrency rewards and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our cryptocurrencies could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we acquire or hold for our own account.

There are inherent risks dealing with the blockchain due to hacking and/or adverse software events.

There can be no assurances that any processes we have adopted or will adopt in the future to manage our cryptocurrency wallets are or will be secure or effective, and we would suffer significant and immediate adverse effects if we suffered a loss of our cryptocurrency due to an adverse software or cybersecurity event. Currently, we use a third-party process that applies several layers of threat reduction techniques, including: (i) the use of hardware wallets to store sensitive private key information; (ii) performance of transactions offline; and (iii) offline generation storage and use of private keys.

At present, the Company is evaluating several third-party custodial wallet alternatives, but there can be no assurance such sources will utilize updated services as they develop in the future, and if a custodial wallet is used there can be no assurance that such services will be more secure than those the Company presently employs. Human error and the constantly evolving state of cybercrime and hacking techniques may render present security protocols and procedures ineffective in ways which we cannot predict at this time. If our security procedures and protocols are ineffectual and our cryptocurrency assets are compromised by cybercriminals, we may not have adequate recourse to recover our losses stemming from such compromise. This would have a negative impact on our business and operations.

Incorrect or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions may be irreversible.

Cryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable. As a consequence of this, incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions could adversely affect our investments and assets.

Cryptocurrency transactions are not reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the cryptocurrencies from the transaction. Cryptocurrency transactions may be reversible with the control or consent of a majority of processing power on the network, however, we do not currently (nor is it feasible that we could in the future) possess sufficient processing power to effectuate this reversal. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to a blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a cryptocurrency or a theft generally will not be reversible, and we may not have sufficient recourse to recover our losses from any such transfer or theft. 

It is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, our cryptocurrency rewards could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled accounts. Furthermore, according to the SEC, at this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative or prosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrency. We are, therefore, presently reliant on existing private investigative entities to investigate any potential loss of our cryptocurrency assets. These third-party service providers rely on data analysis and compliance of internet service providers with traditional court orders to reveal information such as the internet protocol addresses of any attackers who may have target us. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations of and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we acquire or hold for our own account.


21


Our interactions with a blockchain may expose us to SDN or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distribute ledger technology.

The Office of Financial Assets Control of the US Department of Treasury, or OFAC, requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its specially designated nationals, or SDN, list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. Our Company’s policy prohibits any transactions with such SDN individuals, but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we transact with respect to selling cryptocurrency assets. Moreover, federal law prohibits any US person from knowingly or unknowingly possessing any visual depiction commonly known as child pornography. Recent media reports have suggested that persons have imbedded such depictions on one or more blockchains. Because our business requires us to download and retain one or more blockchains to effectuate our ongoing business, it is possible that such digital ledgers contain prohibited depictions without our knowledge or consent. To the extent government enforcement authorities literally enforce these and other laws and regulations that are impacted by decentralized distributed ledger technology, we may be subject to investigation, administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which could harm our reputation and affect the value of our common stock.

Cryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times.

Cryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times and attempts to increase the volume of transactions may not be effective. Scaling cryptocurrencies is essential to the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, such widespread acceptance is necessary to the continued growth and development of our business. Many cryptocurrency networks face significant scaling challenges. For example, cryptocurrencies are limited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second. Participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem debate potential approaches to increasing the average number of transactions per second that the network can handle and have implemented mechanisms or are researching ways to increase scale, such as increasing the allowable sizes of blocks, and therefore the number of transactions per block, and horizontally partitioning data in a database or search engine, which would not require every single transaction to be included in every single miner’s or validator’s block. However, there is no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of settlement of cryptocurrency transactions will be effective, or how long they will take to become effective, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities.

The price of cryptocurrencies may be affected by the sale of such cryptocurrencies by other vehicles investing in cryptocurrencies or tracking cryptocurrency markets.

The global market for cryptocurrency is characterized by supply constraints that differ from those present in the markets for commodities or other assets such as gold and silver. The mathematical protocols under which certain cryptocurrencies are mined permit the creation of a limited, predetermined amount of currency, while others have no limit established on total supply. To the extent that other vehicles investing in cryptocurrencies or tracking cryptocurrency markets form and come to represent a significant proportion of the demand for cryptocurrencies, large redemptions of the securities of those vehicles and the subsequent sale of cryptocurrencies by such vehicles could negatively affect cryptocurrency prices and therefore affect the value of the cryptocurrency inventory we hold. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we acquire or hold for our own account.


22


Because there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets, the determination that we have made for how to account for cryptocurrency assets transactions may be subject to change.

Because there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition and no official guidance has yet been provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, or the SEC, it is unclear how companies may in the future be required to account for cryptocurrency transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the necessity to change our accounting methods and restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could adversely affect the accounting for our newly mined cryptocurrency rewards and more generally negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations as well as and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expects to acquire for our own account and harm investors.

If our cryptocurrency assets become obsolete, we will need significant additional financing to commercialize our products and services, and we may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms or at all.

We are currently exploring various options with respect to developing and implementing services in cryptocurrencies and may actively consider from time to time other significant technological, strategic and operational initiatives. In order to execute on any of these initiatives, we may require additional financing. Our success will depend on our ability to raise such additional financing on reasonable terms and on a timely basis.

We have from time to time evaluated, and we continue to evaluate our potential capital needs. We may utilize one or more types of capital raising in order to fund any initiative in this regard, including the issuance of new equity securities and new debt securities, including debt securities convertible into shares of our common stock. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into shares of our common stock, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and we may grant holders of such securities rights with respect to the governance and operations of our business. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.

Risks Related To Intellectual Property

Assertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results.

In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries. We may face from time to time in the future allegations that we or a supplier or customer have violated the rights of third parties, including patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights.

If, with respect to any claim against us for violation of third-party intellectual property rights, we are unable to prevail in the litigation or retain or obtain sufficient rights or develop non-infringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or cost- efficient basis, our business and competitive position could be materially adversely affected. Many companies may be devoting significant resources to obtaining patents that could potentially cover aspects of our business. We have not exhaustively searched patents relevant to our technologies and business and, therefore, it is possible that we may unknowingly infringe the patents of others.


23


Any claims of infringement, misappropriation or related allegations, whether or not meritorious, would be time-consuming, divert technical and management personnel and be costly to resolve. We do not presently have funds to defend any such claims without materially impacting funds for the development of our products and services. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services, adjust our marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. In addition, certain of our potential suppliers may not indemnify us for third-party infringement or misappropriation claims arising from our use of supplier technology. As a result, we may be liable in the event of such claims. Any of these events could result in increases in operating expenses and result in a loss of business.

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.

We regard our intellectual property as important to our success. We plan to rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, vendors, consultants, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We cannot assure you that the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be sufficient or effective, that any pending or future patent and trademark applications will lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products or services, or that our patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. Furthermore, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices of other countries may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use, our ability to exploit our proprietary technology or our brand may be harmed and, as a result, our business and results of operations may suffer.

 Risks Related To Financial Accounting

The nature of our business requires the application of complex financial accounting rules, and there is limited guidance from accounting standard setting bodies. If financial accounting standards undergo significant changes, our operating results could be adversely affected.

The accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. Recent actions and public comments from the FASB and the SEC have focused on the integrity of financial reporting and internal controls. In addition, many companies’ accounting policies are being subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public. Further, there has been limited precedents for the financial accounting of crypto assets and related valuation and revenue recognition, and no official guidance has been provided by the FASB or the SEC. As such, there remains significant uncertainty on how companies can account for crypto assets transactions, crypto assets, and related revenue. Uncertainties in or changes to regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the need to changing our accounting methods and restate our financial statements and impair our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information, which could adversely affect our financial statements, result in a loss of investor confidence, and more generally impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Future developments regarding the treatment of crypto assets for U.S. federal income and foreign tax purposes could adversely impact our business.

Due to the new and evolving nature of crypto assets and the absence of comprehensive legal guidance with respect to crypto asset products and transactions, many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income and foreign tax treatment of transactions involving crypto assets, such as the purchase and sale of Bitcoin and other crypto assets on our platform, as well as the provision of staking rewards and other crypto asset incentives and rewards products, are uncertain, and it is unclear what guidance may be issued in the future on the treatment of crypto asset transactions for U.S. federal income and foreign tax purposes.


24


In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, released a notice, or IRS Notice, discussing certain aspects of “convertible virtual currency” (that is, digital currency that has an equivalent value in fiat currency or that acts as a substitute for fiat currency) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, in particular, stating that such digital currency (i) is “property” (ii) is not “currency” for purposes of the rules relating to foreign currency gain or loss and (iii) may be held as a capital asset. In 2019, the IRS released a revenue ruling and a set of “Frequently Asked Questions”, or the Ruling & FAQs, that provide some additional guidance, including guidance to the effect that, under certain circumstances, hard forks of digital currencies are taxable events giving rise to ordinary income and guidance with respect to the determination of the tax basis of digital currency. However, the IRS Notice and the Ruling & FAQs do not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of crypto assets and related transactions. Moreover, although the Ruling & FAQs address the treatment of forks, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of income inclusions for various crypto asset transactions including, but not limited to staking rewards and other crypto asset incentives and rewards products that we may offer. Although we believe our treatment of crypto asset transactions is consistent with existing guidance provided by the IRS, because of the rapidly evolving nature of crypto asset innovations and the increasing variety and complexity of crypto asset products, it is possible the IRS may disagree with treatment of our crypto assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could adversely affect our customers and the vitality of our business. Similar uncertainties exist in the foreign markets in which we operate, affecting our non-U.S. customer base, and these uncertainties and potential adverse interpretations of tax law could affect our non-U.S. customers and the vitality of our platforms outside of the United States.

There can be no assurance that the IRS or other foreign tax authority will not alter its existing position with respect to crypto assets in the future or that a court would uphold the treatment set forth in the IRS Notice and the Ruling & FAQs. It is also unclear what additional guidance may be issued in the future on the treatment of existing crypto asset transactions and future crypto asset innovations for purposes of U.S. federal income tax or other foreign tax regulations. Any such alteration of existing IRS and foreign tax authority positions or additional guidance regarding crypto asset products and transactions could result in adverse tax consequences for holders of crypto assets and could have an adverse effect on the value of crypto assets and the broader crypto assets markets. Future technological and operational developments that may arise with respect to digital currencies may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital currencies for U.S. federal income and foreign tax purposes. The uncertainty regarding tax treatment of crypto asset transactions impacts our customers, and could impact our business, both domestically and abroad.

Although we believe we are compliant with U.S. federal income tax reporting and withholding requirements with respect to customer cryptocurrency transactions, the exact scope and application of such requirements, including but not limited to U.S. onboarding requirements through Form W, backup withholding, and Form 1099 reporting obligations, is not entirely clear for all of the crypto asset transactions that we facilitate. It is likely that the IRS will introduce new rules related to our tax reporting and withholding obligations on our customer transactions in the future, possibly in ways that differ from our existing compliance protocols and where there is risk that we do not have proper records to ensure compliance for certain legacy customers. If the IRS determines that we are not in compliance with our tax reporting or withholding requirements with respect to customer crypto asset transactions, we may be exposed to significant penalties, which could adversely affect our financial position. We anticipate additional guidance from the IRS regarding tax reporting and withholding obligations with respect to customer crypto asset transactions that will likely require us to invest substantially in new compliance measures and may require significant retroactive compliance efforts, which could adversely affect our financial position.

Similarly, it is likely that new rules for reporting crypto assets under the “common reporting standard” will be implemented on our international operations, creating new obligations and a need to invest in new onboarding and reporting infrastructure. Such rules are under discussion today by the member and observer states of the “Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development” and may give rise to potential liabilities or disclosure requirements for prior customer arrangements and new rules that affect how we onboard our customers and report their transactions to taxing authorities.

Material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting may limit our ability to prevent or detect financial misstatements or omissions. These material weaknesses could result in our financial statements not being in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and such failure could negatively affect the price of our stock.

Our current management has limited experience managing and operating a public company, and we rely in many instances on the professional experience and advice of third parties. As a result, we have in the past experienced, and in future may continue to experience, material weaknesses and potential problems in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such material weakness could also include a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such requirements are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.

We are required to include in our quarterly and annual reports the conclusion of our principal executive and principal financial officers regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the report. In addition, in connection with our annual report, we are required to provide management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year. Management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective because of material weaknesses that included:


· | lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company’s board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; 
· | insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, and SEC disclosure requirements; and
· | ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. 


We expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management’s time as a result of performing the system and process evaluation, testing and remediation required in order to comply with the management certification.

We are a “smaller reporting company” and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors. When we lose that status, there will be an increase in the costs and demands placed upon management.

As a company that is no longer an emerging growth company, the costs and demands placed upon management will likely increase, as we now have to comply with additional disclosure and accounting requirements.

Public disclosure requirements and compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance pose challenges for our management team and result in additional expenses and costs which may reduce the focus on management and the profitability of our company.

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public markets. Our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.


26


We may identify material weaknesses in our financial reporting, or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.

We are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). Section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. To remediate any material weaknesses, our management has been implementing, and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. We believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness.

If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Risk Factors Related to Management

Some of our officers and directors are working under consulting agreements and have/may have external business opportunities and employment that may be in conflict with us.

Currently, some of our officers and directors are working under consulting agreements and may dedicate time and resources to other functions and personal expenditures, some of which may conflict with our objectives as a company. Any and all conflicts of interest entered into by our officers are brought to the company’s board of director’s attention, with a resolution to the conflict addressed as such, at the time of reveal.

The loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business.

We depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel. Some of these individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our operations. As a result, if any of these individuals were to stop providing services to us, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss of productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and expertise. Moreover, much of our key technology and systems are custom-made by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team, as well as certain of our key technical personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business. We intend to enter into long term contracts with our key personnel but there is no guarantee we will be successful.


27


We may fail to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled employees that are necessary to execute our growth strategy.

Competition for key technical personnel in highly technical industries such as ours is intense. We believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to hire, train, retain and leverage the skills of qualified software engineers, programmers and other highly skilled personnel needed to maintain and grow our network and related technology and develop and successfully implement our products and technology. We may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting, training, retaining and utilizing this highly skilled personnel. In particular, we may have more difficulty attracting or retaining highly skilled personnel during periods of poor operating performance. Any failure to recruit, train and retain highly skilled employees could negatively impact our business and results of operations.

Certain provisions of Delaware law provide for indemnification of our officers and directors at our expense and limit their liability, which may result in a major cost to us and damage the interests of our stockholders, because our resources may be expended for the benefit of our officers and/or directors.

Applicable Delaware law provides for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, for attorney’s fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party resulting from their association with us or activities on our behalf. We are also obligated to pay the expenses of such litigation for any of our directors, officers, employees, or agents, upon such person’s promise to repay us, if it is ultimately determined that any such person shall not have been entitled to indemnification.

We have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, indemnification for liabilities arising under the federal securities laws is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against these types of liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, lawsuit or proceeding, is asserted by a director, officer or controlling person in connection with our securities being registered, we will (unless in the opinion of our counsel, the matter has been settled by controlling precedent) submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the issue of whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The legal process relating to this matter, if it were to occur, probably will be very costly and may result in us receiving negative publicity, either of which factors would probably materially reduce the market and price for our common stock

Risks Related to Common Stock

Our articles of incorporation allow for our board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.

Our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of our preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of additional series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.

Future stock issuances could cause substantial dilution and a decline in our stock price.

We expect to issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into shares of our common stock in connection with future financings and compensatory arrangements and may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities in connection with acquisitions, litigation settlements or otherwise. In addition, a certain number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and other equity incentives. We may reserve additional shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of stock options or other similar forms of equity incentives. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.


28


Our significant stockholders could exert influence over our company, and if the ownership of our common stock continues to be concentrated, or becomes more concentrated in the future, it could prevent our other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.

Epic Industry Corp., or Epic, and Overwatch Partners, Inc., or Overwatch, own, collectively, 100% of the issued and outstanding Series A Preferred shares of the Company, as of the date of this report. Epic also owns 31.3% of the issued and outstanding Series B Preferred shares of the Company, as of the date of this report. As a result, Epic and Overwatch, both which are primarily managed by Michael Hawkins, will be able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval for the foreseeable future, including approval of significant corporate transactions, which may reduce the market price of our common stock. As the Series A Preferred Stock votes on a 1,000:1 basis of common stock, and the Series B Preferred Stock votes on a 100:1 basis of common stock, Michael Hawkins essentially has 90.0% voting control of the Company.

The interests of the dominant stockholders may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. 

Our corporate governance guidelines address potential conflicts between a director’s interests and our interests, and requires our employees and directors to avoid actions or relationships that might conflict or appear to conflict with their job responsibilities or our interests and to disclose their outside activities, financial interests or relationships that may present a possible conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict to management or corporate counsel. These corporate governance guidelines and code of business ethics do not, by themselves, prohibit transactions with Epic and Overwatch.

Risk Factors Associated with Our Common Stock

The market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of the Company’s operating performance, and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuates widely in price in response to various factors, which are beyond our control. Furthermore, we must note that the price of our common stock may not necessarily be indicative of our operating performance or long-term business prospects. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Factors such as the following could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.

Volatility in our common stock price may subject us to securities litigation.

In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We could, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could divert our management’s attention and resources from managing our operations and business.

The Company may issue more shares in connection with future mergers or acquisitions, which could result in substantial dilution to existing shareholders.

Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 blank check preferred stock. Any future merger or acquisition effected by us may result in the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval and may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then-current stockholders. Moreover, the common stock issued in any such merger or acquisition transaction may be valued on an arbitrary or non-arm’s-length basis by our management, resulting in an additional reduction in the percentage of common stock held by our then existing stockholders. Our board of directors has the power to issue any or all of such authorized but unissued shares without stockholder approval. To the extent that additional shares of common stock or preferred stock are issued in connection with a future business combination or otherwise, dilution to the interests of our stockholders will occur, and the rights of the holders of common stock could be materially and adversely affected.


29


We do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and therefore investors should not buy our stock if they wish to receive cash dividends.

We have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and any return on investment may be limited to potential future appreciation on the value of our common stock.

We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including without limitation, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans, and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be party to at the time. To the extent we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if and to the extent our stock price increases, which may never occur. In addition, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize their investment, and if the price of our stock does not appreciate, then there will be no return on investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. 

The Company has deeply centralized management that is vested in a small number of shareholders, officers, and directors, which will limit the rights of the common shareholder.

Our officers, directors, and principal stockholders (greater than 5% stockholders) collectively control approximately 78% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to affect the outcome of, or exert significant influence over, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any change in control. In particular, this concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us. This, in turn, could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. It could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock. Moreover, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, and accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider. 

Our common stock is sometimes legally considered to be a “penny stock,” and thereby be subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell.

Our common stock is at times considered to be a “penny stock.” This fluctuation occurs when our common stock does not qualify for one of the exemptions from the definition of “penny stock” under Section 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. Our common stock becomes a “penny stock” when it meets one or more of the following conditions:


· | the stock trades at a price less than $5.00 per share; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | it is not traded on a “recognized” national exchange; or 
· | it is not quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market, or has a price less than $5.00 per share.


30


The principal result or effect of being designated a “penny stock” is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock are subject to the “penny stock” regulations set forth in Rules 15-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor's account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience, and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor's financial situation, investment experience, and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time-consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise.

The market for our common stock may be subject to the penny stock restrictions, which may result in lack of liquidity and make trading difficult or impossible.

SEC Rule 15g-9 establishes the definition of a “penny stock,” for purposes relevant to us, as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to a limited number of exceptions. Our common stock is currently subject to the penny stock rules, and it is probable that our common stock will continue to be considered to be a penny stock for the immediately foreseeable future. This classification materially and adversely affects the market liquidity for our common stock. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the penny stock rules require that a broker-dealer approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks, and the broker-dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.

To approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker-dealer must obtain financial information, investment experience and objectives of that person and make a reasonable determination that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.

The broker-dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, sets forth:


· | the basis on which the broker-dealer made the suitability determination, and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | that the broker-dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.


Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stock in both public offerings and in secondary trading and commissions payable to, both, the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities, and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.

Because of these regulations, broker-dealers may desire to not engage in the necessary paperwork and disclosures required to sell our common stock, and broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell our common stock, which may affect the ability of holders to sell our common stock in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing trading activity in the secondary market of our common stock. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our common stock. In addition, the liquidity of our common stock may decrease, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our common stock. Our common stock, in all probability, will continue to be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future and our stockholders will, quite probably, have difficulty selling our common stock.


31


Sales of our common stock in reliance on Rule 144 may reduce prices in that market by a material amount.

A significant number of the outstanding shares of our common stock are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. As restricted securities, those shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that an affiliate (i.e., an officer, director, or control person) who has held restricted securities for a prescribed period may, under certain conditions, sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed 1.0% of the issuer’s outstanding common stock. The alternative limitation on the number of shares that may be sold by an affiliate, which is related to the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to the sale is not available to stockholders of companies whose securities are not traded on an “automated quotation system”; because the OTCQB is not such a system, market-based volume limitations are not available for holders of our securities selling under Rule 144.

Pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144, there is no limit on the number of restricted securities that may be sold by a non-affiliate (i.e., a stockholder who has not been an officer, director or control person for at least 90 consecutive days before the date of the proposed sale) after the restricted securities have been held by the owner for a prescribed period, although there may be other limitations and/or criteria to satisfy. A sale pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any other exemption from the Securities Act, if available, or pursuant to registration of shares of our common stock held by our stockholders, may reduce the price of our common stock in any market that may develop.

The trading market for our common stock may be restricted, because of state securities “Blue Sky” laws which prohibit trading absent compliance with individual state laws.

Transfers of our common stock may be restricted pursuant to the securities and state laws promulgated by various states and foreign jurisdictions, commonly referred to as “Blue Sky” laws. Absent compliance with such laws, our common stock may not be traded in such jurisdictions. Because the shares of our common stock registered hereunder have not been registered for resale under the “Blue Sky” laws of any state, the holders of such shares and persons who desire to purchase such shares in any trading market that might develop in the future, should be aware that there may be significant state “Blue Sky” law restrictions upon the ability of investors to sell and purchasers to purchase such shares. These restrictions prohibit the secondary trading our common stock. We currently do not intend and may not be able to qualify securities for resale in those states which do not offer manual exemptions and require securities to be qualified before they can be resold by our stockholders. Accordingly, investors should consider the secondary market for our securities to be limited.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, sales practice requirements may limit a shareholder’s ability to buy and sell our common shares.

In addition to the applicable “penny stock” rules, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common shares, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.

Future issuances of shares for various considerations including working capital and operating expenses will increase the number of shares outstanding which will dilute existing investors and may have a depressive effect on the company’s stock price.

There may be substantial dilution to our shareholders purchasing in future offerings as a result of future decisions of the board to issue shares without shareholder approval for cash, services, payment of debt or acquisitions.


32


There may in all likelihood be little demand for shares of our common stock and as a result, investors may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if they need to liquidate their investment.

There may be little demand for shares of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board, or OTC Markets.com, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if the Company came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven, early-stage company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of any of our securities until such time as it became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in the Company’s securities is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on the securities price. We cannot give investors any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for the Company’s common securities will develop or be sustained, or that any trading levels will be sustained. Due to these conditions, we can give investors no assurance that they will be able to sell their shares at or near ask prices or at all if they need money or otherwise desire to liquidate their securities of the Company.

SHOULD ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INCORRECT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, BELIEVED, ESTIMATED, EXPECTED, INTENDED OR PLANNED.
