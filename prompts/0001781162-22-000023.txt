Item 1. Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Momentus.
Background and Business Combination
On August 12, 2021, the Company consummated a merger pursuant to certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 7, 2020, and as amended on March 5, 2021, April 6, 2021, and June 29, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Stable Road Acquisition Corp (“SRAC”), Project Marvel First Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of SRAC (“First Merger Sub”), and Project Marvel Second Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of SRAC (“Second Merger Sub”), pursuant to which First Merger Sub merged with and into Momentus Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Legacy Momentus”) with Legacy Momentus as the surviving corporation of the First Merger Sub, and immediately 
following which Legacy Momentus merged with and into the Second Merger Sub, with the Second Merger Sub as the surviving entity (the “Business Combination”). In connection with the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), the Company changed its name from Stable Road Acquisition Corp. to Momentus Inc., and Legacy Momentus changed its name to Momentus Space, LLC.
The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805") in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Under this method of accounting, SRAC, who was the legal acquirer, is treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes and Legacy Momentus is treated as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination is treated as the equivalent of a capital transaction in which Legacy Momentus issued stock for the net assets of SRAC, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, and Legacy Momentus’ financial statements became those of the Company. Reported shares and earnings per share available to holders of the Company’s common stock, prior to the Business Combination, have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Business Combination. See Note 3 for more information.
Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, at the Closing, each share of SRAC’s Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B Common Stock”), converted into one share of SRAC’s Class A Common Stock. After the Closing and following the effectiveness of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, each share of Class A Common Stock was automatically reclassified, redesignated and changed into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, without any further action by the Company or any stockholder thereof.
Prior to the Business Combination, SRAC’s units, public shares, and public warrants were listed on the Nasdaq under the symbols “SRACU,” “SRAC,” and “SRACW,” respectively. On August 13, 2021, the Company's Class A common stock and public warrants began trading on the Nasdaq, under the symbols “MNTS” and “MNTSW,” respectively.
On October 7, 2020 and subsequently amended on July 15, 2021, SRAC entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”) to which such investors collectively subscribed for an aggregate of 11,000,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at $10.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $110.0 million (the “PIPE Investment”). The PIPE Investors were also granted an equal number of private warrants to purchase the Company’s Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. The warrants were recorded as a derivative liability under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging and the warrant liability was initially valued at $30.5 million. See Note 11 for more information. The PIPE Investment was consummated concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination.
Overview
Momentus is a U.S. commercial space company that plans to offer transportation and infrastructure services to help enable the commercialization of space. Satellite operators are our principal customers and target customers. Services that we plan to provide include “last mile” satellite transportation, payload-hosting, on-orbit satellite refueling, on-orbit inspection, on-orbit satellite maintenance, de-orbiting, debris removal, and other satellite-to-satellite service offerings. We believe our planned service offerings will increase deployment options for satellite operators and lower their operating costs relative to traditional approaches while also minimizing environmental impact given our choice of water as a propellant. 
We plan to provide these services with Orbital Transfer Vehicles (“OTVs”) that we design and manufacture. While we plan to eventually operate a family of progressively larger and more capable OTVs, we are currently focused on developing the first vehicle of the family, Vigoride, which will primarily operate in low earth orbit (LEO). We believe that Vigoride, once further developed, tested and validated, will have the potential to deliver fast, versatile, and cost-effective transportation and infrastructure services to our customers. We anticipate performing our inaugural mission with Vigoride as early as June 2022, subject to receipt of licenses and government approvals, and successful completion of our current efforts to get the system ready for flight. Refer to our risk factor “We may not receive all required governmental licenses and approvals” 
Our transportation service offering will focus on delivering our customers’ satellites to precision orbits of their choosing. To accomplish this, we plan to create a hub-and-spoke transportation network in partnership with leading launch service providers, such as SpaceX. Under this model, our customers’ satellites would “ride share” from Earth to space on a midsized or large rocket. Our OTVs would then provide “last mile” transportation services from the rocket’s drop-off orbit to a custom orbit of the satellite operator’s choosing. We believe our hub-and-spoke model 
has the potential to expand our customers’ deployment options relative to what they would be able to achieve with ride share launch alone, while reducing their costs relative to what they could achieve with a dedicated small launch vehicle. Over time, we plan to begin introducing additional services beyond “last mile” transportation. 
Our OTVs will initially be expendable, meaning they will de-orbit themselves upon completion of their first mission. However, our goal is to eventually make our OTVs reusable, or capable of remaining in space to conduct follow-on missions, which has the potential to lower our cost to deliver services to our customers. To achieve reusability, we need to develop additional technologies that will allow our vehicles to 1.) locate and navigate to customer satellites in space, 2.) physically connect to them, and 3.) perform a variety of robotic operations including fluid transfer. We are developing these capabilities for Vigoride, but expect them to be scalable to work with larger vehicles that we plan to develop in the future. Refer to “Risk Factors — A key component of our business model is the delivery of satellites using our vehicles from low earth orbit to other orbits. The technology for this maneuver is still in the development stage...”
Since our founding in 2017, we have been working to develop, test and enhance our vehicles and supporting technologies, particularly our water plasma propulsion technology. We have signed contracts for approximately $67 million in backlog (potential revenue), as of January 31, 2022. These agreements contain firm orders as well as options, allowing customers to opt-in to launches on shorter notice without requiring a separate agreement. The breadth of these signed contracts spans across 24 companies. In general, our customers have the right to cancel their contracts with the understanding that they will forgo their deposits. If a customer cancels a contract before it is required to pay non-refundable deposits, we may not receive revenue from these orders, except for an initial deposit which is paid at the time the contract is signed. Refer to “Risk Factors — We may not be able to convert our orders in backlog into revenue.”
Commercial Space Industry
Our services are made possible by the space industry’s rapid technological developments over the past two decades, driven predominantly by significant decreases in launch costs, as well as the advent of smaller, lower-cost satellites. This convergence of trends has led to increased access to space, new market entrants and accelerated growth in the number of commercial satellites being placed into orbit.
In the launch market, we believe we are witnessing significant shifts caused by the emergence of large, partially reusable rockets such as SpaceX’s Falcon-9 and Blue Origin’s New Glenn, and the advent of new fully reusable vehicles such as SpaceX’s Starship and Relativity’s Terran R. Reliable, low-cost access to space is lowering the entry barriers for new service models and has allowed new entrants to grow quickly. In the future, we anticipate further disruption from a new breed of much larger, fully reusable rockets such as Starship. With these much larger rockets, launch costs could fall far enough to enable new applications that would not be economically viable with current generation launch vehicles. 
Another paradigm shift in the commercial space market is the rise of the small satellite (smallsat). Prior to 2018, only a few dozen smallsats (total mass below approximately 200 kg) were launched per year. Today, the number has grown to several hundred per year and is on track to reach more than several thousand per year. Moreover, the rise of this market has also created a new market segment in microsatellites (total mass below approximately 100 kg) and nanosatellites (total mass below approximately 10 kg). While these satellites can be deployed individually, they can also be operated as part of a constellation, a large group of satellites interconnected to provide a service, such as the Starlink satellite constellation’s offering of global internet connectivity. 
Smallsat proliferation has led operators to explore new ways of accessing space. To meet their needs, small launch providers (i.e., small rockets carrying up to approximately 500kg) have emerged as options for smaller payloads. While accessing space often costs up to ten times more per kilogram on a small rocket compared to a large rocket, such as Falcon-9, it is often uneconomical for small satellite operators to purchase a dedicated large rocket that may have up to one hundred times more payload capacity than a small rocket. “Ride sharing” on a large rocket is a more accessible option as it can drastically lower the cost for a small satellite operator to reach space, albeit with reduced deployment options compared to a dedicated launch vehicle as “ride share” payloads are often all released into the same orbit. Conversely, a dedicated small rocket, while more expensive compared to ride sharing on a larger rocket, can increase deployment options for small satellite operators by offering them direct access to precision orbits of their choosing. 
We anticipate there could be considerable growth over the coming years in the space transportation segment as companies continue to seek versatile and low-cost ways to deliver single satellites to specific orbits or deploy their satellite constellations. We anticipate that the need for small satellite transportation to LEO will continue to drive overall demand growth for space transportation services in the short-term as technology advancements continue to 
make space more accessible to new market entrants, although new applications beyond LEO are also emerging. We also believe that over the next decade, new space-based businesses may emerge, for example the generation of solar energy in space, space manufacturing or space data processing. The advent of these new business models could substantially increase demand for space transportation and other space infrastructure services.
Beyond transportation, we anticipate that growth of the satellite constellations market may drive demand for our Hosted Payload, on-orbit satellite refueling, on-orbit inspection, on-orbit satellite maintenance, de-orbiting, debris removal, and other satellite-to-satellite service offerings, if we are successful in executing on our business plan, including fully developing and validating our technology in space. Satellite constellations have relatively low lifespans and, in our view, will require maintenance, de-orbiting, and other general servicing with higher frequency.
Planned Service Offerings
We are developing our OTVs to provide safe, affordable, reliable, and regular in-space services to our customers, including Space Transportation, Payload Hosting, and In-Orbit Servicing. We are designing our Vigoride vehicle to deliver small customer payloads anywhere in LEO. However, we also plan to design larger vehicles to carry larger payloads to more distant orbits. 
If our technology is fully developed and validated in the future, we currently plan to provide the following infrastructure services to the space economy:
•Space Transportation: We are designing a space transportation service based on a hub-and-spoke model, which combines ride share launch on a medium or large rocket with last-mile delivery using one of our OTVs. Under this model, our customers will deliver their payload to us a few months prior to launch for integration onto our vehicle. Once we have integrated our customers’ payloads, we will then ship our vehicle, holding the customer payload fixture, to the launch site, where it will be integrated onto the rocket. The rocket will then transport our vehicle to the drop-off orbit. After separation from the rocket, our vehicle will transport our customers’ payloads to their chosen final orbit.
We believe our hub-and-spoke model has the potential to expand our customers’ deployment options relative to what they could achieve with ride share launch alone, while reducing their costs relative to what they could achieve with a dedicated small launch vehicle. For example, a microsatellite operator could ride share launch to a standard orbit on a large rocket for as little as $5,000 per kilogram. Alternatively, transportation to a custom orbit on a dedicated small rocket could cost a microsat operator more than $70,000 per kilogram. We plan to price our hub-and-spoke transportation services to custom orbits above competing ride-share services to standard orbits, but below what a satellite operator would need to pay to access a custom orbit using a dedicated small rocket.
•Hosted Payload: We believe our customers can lower their manufacturing costs by applying modularity and standardization to a satellite’s design. In the future, we plan to develop a modular approach to satellite systems through our subscription-based Hosted Payload service. This service is designed to help our customers avoid a meaningful capital outlay to design and manufacture a bespoke satellite as they would under traditional business models, which assumed tight integration of a given payload with its satellite bus. The traditionally bespoke approach to satellite design and manufacturing was a natural consequence of infrequent, expensive launches. Most satellites were one-of-a-kind, and designers would do their best to optimize each satellite’s mass for its mission, given the constraints imposed by the pre-selected launch vehicle. However, as low-cost Earth-to-orbit transportation has become more prevalent, bespoke satellite design and manufacturing costs have come to dominate over launch. 
We are designing our transfer vehicles for modularity and ease of integration with customer payloads, and with a full suite of capabilities that our customers will need on orbit. Under our Hosted Payload model, our vehicle, after transporting a customer payload to a specific orbit, would stay connected to the payload for the duration of its mission to provide continuous power, orbit maintenance, orientation, and communications to support telemetry, commanding, and downlinking of payload data. Our objective is to offer a higher degree of modularity which we believe has the potential to significantly increase orbital accessibility and/or lower manufacturing costs for a wide range of satellite operators.
•In-Orbit Servicing: We view in-orbit servicing of satellites as a quickly growing business opportunity. As the number of satellites in space increases, so does their need to be serviced. We plan to design Momentus’ future reusable vehicles to be capable of performing in-orbit servicing and are pursuing development activities that support this objective. Although we are still in very preliminary stages for developing this technology, our aim is to equip future vehicles with robotic arms and an ability to maneuver in close 
proximity to other spacecraft and dock or berth with them. Once fully developed, we believe these capabilities could allow us to offer a suite of different in-orbit services, such as inspection, refueling, life extension, re-positioning, salvage missions, maintenance and repair, and de-orbiting. 
Total Addressable Market for Our Services
According to Morgan Stanley, the broader space economy is projected to grow from approximately $350 billion in 2016 to over $1 trillion by 2040.
According to Stratistics, the space transportation market is projected to increase from approximately $10 billion in 2018 to approximately $35 billion in 2026. This estimate includes launch services as well as in-space transportation.
Deutsche Bank estimates the current total addressable market (“TAM”) for in-space transportation to be approximately $2 billion annually, and projects this market to approximately double to $4 billion by 2025 including $2-2.5 billion for onboard satellite propulsion and $1.5-2 billion for “space tugs” (OTVs). While this estimate excludes launch services, we would note that we generally bundle launch services from third-party providers with our in-space transportation services. 
Our Service Vehicles 
Our primary research and development objectives focus on the development of our existing and future in-space transfer and service vehicles and related water plasma propulsion technology.
Vigoride is the first vehicle that we are developing. Once fully developed, tested and validated in space, we expect Vigoride will be sufficient to meet our initial operating plan of offering in-space transportation in LEO to small satellites. We plan to offer services with our Vigoride vehicle beginning as early as June 2022, subject to receipt of licenses and government approvals, and successful completion of our current efforts to get the system ready for flight. The success of our in-space infrastructure services business will depend on our ability to successfully and regularly deliver customer satellites into custom orbits. We have ground-tested several Vigoride vehicles in preparation for flight, including, where appropriate, subsystem- and system level environmental testing, performance testing, and life testing in relevant environments, but we have yet to fly any of these vehicles in space. 
Vigoride is intended to transport up to 750 kg of customer payload in LEO, although our payload capacity will likely be lower in most common configurations. We have set the delta-v and host power objectives for Vigoride at 2 km/sec and 1 kW, respectively, which we believe we can achieve a few years into our product roadmap. We have entered into a launch services agreement with SpaceX that secures space for Vigoride on a launch vehicle that SpaceX currently targets operating in June 2022. This would represent the inaugural launch of a complete Momentus vehicle into space and would allow us to further validate Vigoride’s capabilities. While securing space on the manifest is an important step, our plan to launch in June remains subject to the receipt of licenses and other government approvals, and successful completion of our current efforts to get the system ready for flight. 
Our planned June launch is intended to be a demonstration mission. While we plan to take a few paying customer payloads along, the primary goals of our inaugural mission are to test Vigoride on orbit and learn from any issues that we may encounter. The lessons learned from this initial flight will help inform changes we can make to future missions as we seek to ultimately certify a design for production. Depending on the nature of issues we encounter, our schedule for future launches and other planned activities could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will not experience operational or process failures and other problems during our inaugural mission or on any other mission. Any failures or setbacks, particularly on our inaugural mission, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
Because our technologies have not yet been fully tested, our service offering to our customers on our inaugural mission will be limited. To reflect this, we expect to provide discounts to customers on this mission relative to the price we intend to eventually charge for our transportation services. During our inaugural mission, we plan to demonstrate Vigoride’s ability to deploy satellites at the point at which it is dropped off by the launch vehicle, rather than independently maneuver customer satellites to custom orbits. Once all customer payloads have been released, we plan to perform certain maneuvers and technology demonstrations to validate our technology and establish the potential commercial viability of our strategy. This approach limits risk for us as well as for our customers. 
Beyond our planned June launch, we are planning to fly Vigoride again in the second half of 2022, subject to receipt of licenses and government approvals, and successful completion of our current efforts to get the system ready for flight.
Early Vigoride vehicles will not be reusable, meaning that we will de-orbit them following delivery of their customer payloads. However, around the middle of this decade, we plan to make our vehicles capable of reuse such that, upon delivery of their payloads, they will be able to remain in space to conduct follow-on missions. Establishing reusable vehicles will require significant additional research and technological developments. We believe our choice of water as a propellant will help with the creation of reusable vehicles because water can be stored without special conditions, other than ensuring lines and tanks do not freeze or become obstructed with ice, for an indefinite amount of time and pumped easily. Additionally, water is safe and non-hazardous relative to commonly used propellants such as cryogenic components and hypergolic toxic fuels for chemical propulsion, or highly pressurized noble gases (such as Xenon or Krypton) for electrical propulsion. We believe that if we are able to achieve reusability, it will allow us to lower manufacturing and launch costs on a per-ride basis and achieve higher margins and returns for our investors while also reducing our environmental impact.
Beyond Vigoride, we envision bringing two progressively larger vehicles to market, which we call Ardoride and Fervoride. These vehicles will be similar to our Vigoride vehicle, but with larger structures, larger solar arrays, and more powerful propulsion systems in order to carry progressively larger payloads progressively further from Earth.
Water Plasma Propulsion Technology Overview
We believe our water plasma propulsion technology can provide a competitive advantage for our vehicles and services. The technology is being designed to work as follows: Solar panels attached to our vehicle capture solar energy, which is then converted into microwave energy using standard microwave conversion technology, for which we currently use a magnetron. However, our objective is to shift to solid-state power amplifiers in the future. The conversion technology then takes direct current (“DC”) power from the solar arrays and storage batteries and outputs the energy in the form of microwaves into the thrust chamber. Once in the chamber, microwave energy is transferred into the water propellant, creating steam, which is forced through a separate injector. The water is then heated into a plasma state and expelled from the thruster through a separate nozzle, thus creating a propulsive force. This propulsion is what would create motion in space.
What we believe to be unique to this technology is its potential ability to be designed for specific combinations of ISP and thrust to improve in-space transportation operations. We believe other space propulsion technologies are unlikely to be designed to operate at the same mix of ISP and delta v, resulting in each having its disadvantages for transportation missions. We believe our technology has the potential to achieve considerable propulsive thrust levels while maintaining high ISP, which would enable shorter mission duration, enhanced reach, and higher payload mass ratios. Our objective is to evolve towards larger and more capable vehicles, and if we are successful in meeting this objective, we expect this technology’s potential capabilities to scale well. We believe modifications will revolve around research and engineering to increase the size of the water tanks, radiation-hardening for our vehicles’ components, and further scaling our thruster technology. While these potential capabilities will require significant development time and expense, we believe that our highly experienced team of engineers will help enable us to successfully enhance and scale our key technologies. 
We chose water as our propellant for several reasons. We believe water is significantly safer than all chemical alternatives, allowing for safe testing and associated operating cost savings across the entire testing chain. Beyond testing, water is a safe resource that we believe will also be considerably safer in space than propellants that introduce risk of accidental combustion. Water can also be stored efficiently at low pressures and over the temperature ranges in which spacecraft equipment typically operates, subject to ensuring lines and tanks do not freeze or become obstructed with ice. This avoids the need for high-pressure tanks which themselves pose an explosion hazard.
Another potential key advantage of our technology is its low cost of production and maintenance. Our engine design consists of inexpensive and readily available materials, resulting in an overall simple design and a vehicle whose propulsion, structure, avionics, and mechanisms can be efficiently and vertically integrated.
Although we believe our water plasma propulsion technology will be a key differentiator for our product offerings, to date, we have only conducted a single test of this technology in space. Although we believe our test unit generated plasma in space and validated the theoretical basis of our technology, we have yet to experimentally confirm the unit’s ability to generate thrust in space, which is crucial to our ability to perform real on-orbit maneuvers. Until we can accomplish this, the technology will remain in the experimental stages. Moreover, even if the unit generates thrust, there can be no assurance that it can be operated in a manner that is sufficiently reliable and efficient to permit full commercialization of the technology. Our statements and beliefs about the viability of our technology are primarily based on theoretical analyses and experimentally observed results during ground testing and our single test of this technology in space. Development of space technologies is extremely complex, time consuming, and 
expensive, and there can be no assurance that our predicted theoretical and ground-based results will translate into operational space vehicles that operate within the parameters we expect, or at all. 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K describes Momentus’ current business plans for continuing to develop its technology and marketing its products, however there can be no assurance that Momentus will be able to successfully develop its technologies and implement them in commercially viable vehicles. For a further description of the risks associated with our business, see Risk Factors below.
Development Timeline
Momentus has continued to evolve and improve its microwave electro-thermal (“MET”) technology since development began in 2017. Our first-generation X-band thruster, which operates at 30 Watts, was flown aboard a demonstration mission called El Camino Real in mid-2019. During this mission, Momentus launched its first MET into space as a hosted payload on a nanosatellite. The mission’s objective was to demonstrate the MET’s ability to produce water plasma in space by performing 100 one-minute firings. The MET was instrumented with temperature, pressure and RF reflected power sensors to infer the presence of water plasma, which if detected, would indicate that the water propellant was flowing into the thrust chamber and radio frequency energy was being absorbed by the water. Failure of the host satellite in November 2019 prematurely terminated the demonstration after only 23 of the planned 100 firings of the thruster had been performed including 12 hot firings with microwave power turned on and 11 cold firings with the microwave turned off. While a pump issue significantly restricted flow of water into the thruster during nine of the 12 hot firings, preventing plasma-generation, the three hot firings that did have water present were found to have produced plasma. Although pressure and temperature data did not provide sufficient information to either confirm or contradict plasma presence, Momentus believes that the reflected power data collected during the three hot firings with water present to be sufficient to conclude that plasma was produced. Reflected power data collected during these three in-space firings closely matched ground test data collected by similar or identical sensors and associated with observed successful firings of the MET where water plasma was generated. We have incorporated potential solutions to the aforementioned pump issue and other observed weaknesses from El Camino Real into subsequent iterations of our propulsion system design, pressure sensor selection and vehicle integration and test process.
The Vigoride vehicle was re-designed in 2020 to increase its payload capacity. Vigoride 2 was designed to use a pair of C-band MET which would each operate at 550 Watts at the target thrust level and approximately 75% of the target specific impulse (Isp) of our internal performance goal. This C-band thruster has undergone extensive development over the last several years. This early generation of the thruster was life tested to a reduced mission of 350 cycles (firings) and 35 hours of accumulated firing. 
While Vigoride 1 and Vigoride 2 are both fully built and ground-tested, we do not currently intend to fly either vehicle in space. Both will be retained in storage and lessons learned from their production and ground-testing will be incorporated into future Vigoride vehicles that we intend to fly.
Vigoride 3 is being built with an upgraded 750-Watt version of the C-band MET with the aim of producing greater thrust. Unit qualification and system level functionality testing is complete, and, during the first quarter of 2022, the vehicle completed environmental testing in our thermal vacuum chamber, which simulates the environment in space. Our testing sequence is designed to uncover issues on the ground where we can deal with them more readily and effectively than we could in space. Over the next few weeks, the team will be addressing issues that were uncovered during thermal vacuum testing. After this, the vehicle will undergo vibration testing, which simulates the environment on the launch vehicle, and other ground tests. We expect Vigoride 3 to be fully qualified in the first half of 2022, before our planned inaugural launch, although the schedule is tight. See “Risk Factors — A key component of our business model is the delivery of satellites using our vehicles from lower earth orbit to other orbits. The technology for this maneuver is still in the development stage and has not been validated...” 
Our Relationships with Launch Providers
We are designing each of our vehicles to be compatible with most rockets, and we have not entered into exclusivity arrangements with any single launch provider. We currently do not anticipate any changes to this approach, as we want to maximize our opportunities and retain the optionality to engage with other launch providers. Other advantages of maintaining a diverse set of launch partners include service resiliency in the event of launch failures and the subsequent grounding of a launch vehicle, access to otherwise protected markets through the use of specific launch vehicles and orbit diversity to provide access to all orbits of interest to our customers. 
To date, we have entered into several launch services agreements including with SpaceX, Relativity Space, ABL Space Systems and Gilmour Space. Beyond these providers, we remain in active dialogue and believe we have 
strong relationships with Blue Origin, ULA, and several other small rocket providers. Our objective is to extend existing agreements or enter into new agreements as necessary to build a robust launch manifest and cadence. Our ability to achieve this objective relies heavily on whether or not we can successfully procure the necessary government licenses and approvals, and slots on the launch provider’s manifests, and whether we can successfully execute on our business plan, including fully developing and validating our technology in space. 
We believe we have developed a strong relationship with SpaceX with which we maintain an innovative rideshare partnership. We believe the relationship between our companies is recognized as mutually beneficial. We believe Momentus could unlock a market for SpaceX by consolidating small satellites on our transport vehicles once we have fully developed, tested and validated them in space, which will then be launched by SpaceX on their Falcon-9 rideshare missions, and delivered by Momentus to their unique, respective orbits.
Made in Space Europe Relationship Overview
We plan to leverage our Hosted Payload capabilities, once fully developed, tested and validated in space, with Made In Space Europe, a subsidiary of Redwire. Made in Space Europe is developing a low-cost robotic arm that we believe will be well suited for use on Vigoride vehicles for robotic berthing operations, which are needed to enable reusability. Momentus is working with Made In Space Europe to provide mission-specific requirements to inform their robotic arm development. We anticipate conducting a joint in-orbit demonstration mission with Made In Space Europe, with the objective of demonstrating the arm’s ability to perform various tasks that may be needed for reusability and future servicing missions.
RBC Signals Relationship Overview
Momentus has chosen RBC Signals as our ground systems provider for Vigoride contemplated missions in LEO. We believe RBC’s extensive network of over 70 antennas located in over 50 geographic locations is well suited to support a high mission volume to diverse orbits. Furthermore, we believe RBC’s pay-per-pass model is an excellent fit for our currently contemplated, relatively short mission durations of several months (before reusability). We believe RBC’s ground network service offers a dramatic cost and complexity advantage over a dedicated ground network and significant cost advantages over other traditional ground system providers.
Competitive Advantages 
We believe our ability to compete successfully as a commercial provider of space transportation and infrastructure services will depend on several factors including our ability to fully develop, test and validate our technology in space, our ability to establish and maintain a lead in technological advancements, the price of our offerings, customer confidence in the reliability of our offerings, and the frequency and availability of our offerings. If we are unable to fully develop, test and validate our technologies, we may be unable to execute on our business plan and will be unable to realize the following competitive advantages. We believe that our team’s collective expertise, coupled with the following strengths, may allow us to build our business and compete successfully. 
•Focus on a service model with standardized, modular vehicles: Unlike traditional aerospace companies, which generally focus on selling hardware, Momentus is applying a service model for infrastructure services in space. We believe our service model will build long-lasting partnership relationships with satellite operators, which could create entry barriers for competitors. 
•Unique technology with patents pending: We believe that our water plasma propulsion technology and its integration in our vehicles will allow us to provide in-space transportation services at significantly lower cost compared to what can be accomplished using traditional chemical or electrical propulsion systems. We plan to be the first company to commercialize and industrialize microwave electrothermal (MET) water propulsion technology for in-space transportation. While microwave electrothermal propulsion has been researched academically for decades, the commercial viability of the technology has not yet been fully tested or proven. Over the past several years, we have worked on developing our patent-pending water plasma propulsion technology, and we are designing our vehicles and services to incorporate this technology. We are in the process of creating a patent portfolio and, as of December 31, 2021, we had one issued patent and applications for nine additional patent families relating to our water plasma propulsion and other technologies. We believe that our issued patent, pending patent applications and trade secrets will make it more challenging for competitors who aspire to use MET propulsion technology.
•Mission-driven strategy: Momentus is a mission-driven company, which underpins our focus on our long-term vision and aligns all of our day-to-day activities in achieving this goal. In making decisions about our vehicles, services, technologies, or sales opportunities, we attempt to align our actions with our vision and 
mission. We believe this helps us make decisions quickly and move towards achieving our goal of developing Momentus as a key provider of space infrastructure services. 
•Compatibility across launch providers: We have designed and will continue to design our future vehicles to be compatible with most launch vehicles. We believe this will give our customers flexibility around the timing and availability of launches and ensure a competitive market for our launch providers. As more rocket operators emerge, we will work to continue to actively incorporate compatibility to increase customer accessibility. 
•Relationships with launch providers: We have relationships with several launch providers including SpaceX, Relativity Space, Gilmour Space, Blue Origin, ABL Space Systems and ULA. We believe our current rideshare partnership agreement with SpaceX will help us maximize the flexibility, economics, and optionality we can offer our customers. Additionally, as an aggregator of payloads, we believe we will be able to service customers from around the world who might not otherwise have access to launch options. Please see the above section titled “Our Relationships with Launch Providers” for additional details. 
•Experienced management team and an industry-leading team of engineers: Many of our management team members have experience in large organizations, including the U.S. Department of Defense, Boeing, Raytheon, Maxar, and Lockheed Martin. Our team of engineers is similarly experienced, contributing hundreds of collective years in working in commercial satellite businesses at Boeing, Maxar, and SSL, among others. Our commercial team is also led and supported by individuals with considerable experience in commercial space sales. Our efficient vertical integration allows for significant cooperation and interactivity between teams.
Customer Overview
We have signed contracts for approximately $67 million in backlog (potential revenue), as of January 31, 2022. These agreements contain firm orders as well as options, allowing customers to opt-in to launches on shorter notice without requiring a separate agreement. We have seen significant interest across a range of satellite operators, satellite manufacturers, satellite aggregators, launch providers, and others. The majority of our signed contracts are with early adopters. Several will be launching experimental or pathfinder missions for their future satellite constellations. The breadth of these signed contracts spans 24 companies across 15 countries. 
In general, our customers have the right to cancel their contracts with the understanding that they will forgo their deposits. If a customer cancels a contract before it is required to pay non-refundable deposits, we may not receive revenue from these orders, except for an initial deposit which is paid at the time the contract is signed. 
For risks associated with these contracts, see our risk factor “We may not be able to convert our orders in backlog into revenue.”
Sales and Marketing
We plan to scale and accelerate our sales and marketing efforts and leverage industry partnerships to grow our customer base using a global network of sales professionals. Additionally, if we can successfully execute on our missions, we expect existing customers to exercise contract options and expand their contracts with us for the deployment of their future satellites. We plan to provide new service offerings and sales models over time to increase market share and grow the total addressable market for our in-space infrastructure services assuming we can successfully execute on our missions and business plan.
In addition to satellite manufacturers, we are pursuing engagements with payload aggregators to maximize the fill rates of our missions. We are also working on long term partnership agreements with specialized CubeSat satellite makers to become their partner of choice for rideshare services, to help realize a continuous cycle of returning customers. In addition, many rideshare aggregators are also satellite manufacturers that help create a vertical integration of services — for which our plan is to have Momentus serve as the link to complete end-to-end service for their customers.
As we believe a large percentage of the small satellite market is projected to be satellite constellations, which will require deployments, refreshing, in orbit maintenance and other services over their life-cycles (which are relatively short), we see this segment of the market as important. We currently have a number of pathfinder missions with customers that plan to develop satellite constellations after their test missions, and we are pursuing other satellite constellation customers who are in their early stages of development.
While we are focusing on our early adopter market for in-space transportation, we are at the early stages of also rolling out our Hosted Payload service, and anticipate that this market segment will become a larger percentage of our business in the near and mid-term. We believe our potential customer base for this service has significant overlap with in-space transportation.
We anticipate the emergence of new businesses as the space economy continues to be unlocked and new applications are introduced. We plan to position ourselves to capture these emerging and adjacent markets which we believe will be enabled by the development of infrastructure services.
Regulatory
See “Risk Factors” for risks and uncertainties related to regulatory requirements. 
Federal Communications Commission 
The regulations, policies, and guidance issued by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) apply to the operation of our transport vehicles. When we communicate with our transport vehicles using any part of the electromagnetic spectrum, we are operating a space station to which FCC regulations apply. Operators of regulated space stations are required to hold and maintain compliance with proper licenses, and the specific conditions thereof throughout the duration of any given mission. Operators may also seek licenses in other jurisdictions in accordance with multilateral agreements governing the use of the spectrum, and such licenses would generally be accorded equal treatment by the United States. For the time being, we intend to utilize the FCC’s Special Temporary Authorization (“STA”) authorization type, as other rideshare aggregators and operators of unique limited duration missions regularly do, to license Momentus spacecraft. Although Momentus previously submitted multiple STA license applications, which have subsequently been withdrawn, we filed STA applications at the end of 2021 in support of two spacecraft scheduled to launch in June 2022. Subsequently, we withdrew one of the two applications since it was not needed. 
The FCC recently enacted a new set of licensing guidelines for small satellites and related systems that may apply to future Momentus spacecraft and continues to pursue additional updated rulemaking that potentially impacts Momentus. As a result, we may face a transition in license types away from STA to the small satellite licensing guidelines under Part 25. The FCC is also currently considering additional rules which, among other things, could change the operational, technical and financial requirements for Momentus operations. If these proposed rules become final, they could change system design and financial costs in order to comply with or secure new Momentus spectrum licensure. 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
Momentus transport vehicles will operate with space-qualified photographic equipment installed. While primarily intended to function as mission assurance tools, these cameras will be capable of capturing incidental earth imagery while in orbit. As such, these cameras are subject to the licensing requirements and regulations of the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration's ("NOAA") Commercial Report Sensing Regulatory Affairs (“CRSRA”) office. We currently hold a license grant from CRSRA authorizing the first ten Vigoride missions.
The Federal Aviation Administration
As a participant in launch activities, we are indirectly subject to the license requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (“FAA”) Office of Commercial Space Transportation (“AST”). The FAA regulates the airspace of the United States, through which launch vehicles must fly during launch to orbit. The AST office predominantly processes launch license requests submitted by launch vehicle operators, which include information on the constituent payloads flying on any given mission. As a result, reviews of our payloads by AST occur during, for example, the processing of a SpaceX launch license. During preparation for the inaugural Vigoride-1 mission, the FAA ultimately determined that it was unable to grant to SpaceX an approval of the Momentus payload for the SpaceX Transporter-1 launch in January 2021 due to national security and foreign ownership concerns regarding Momentus raised by the Department of Defense during an interagency review. Despite Momentus payloads being exempt from FAA payload review as a result of our existing NOAA grant, we initiated ongoing engagement with the FAA as part of a preemptive payload review unrelated to a launch license in contemplation of future launch activity. In May 2021, the FAA denied one of our payload review applications due to interagency concerns related to the corporate structure of Momentus at the time of denial. The FAA acknowledged that Momentus was engaged in addressing the concern and indicated that the FAA could reconsider the application once that process is complete. Momentus intends to refile FAA payload review applications in support of future missions which will reflect the ongoing efforts to address outstanding interagency concerns. 
The International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Controls 
Our orbital infrastructure business is subject to, and we must comply with, stringent U.S. import and export control laws, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the “ITAR”) of the U.S. Department of State and the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) of the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The ITAR generally restricts the export of hardware, software, technical data, and services that have defense or strategic applications. The EAR similarly regulates the export of hardware, software, and technology that has commercial or “dual-use” applications (i.e., for both military and commercial applications) or that have less sensitive military or space-related applications that are not subject to the ITAR. The regulations exist to advance the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. 
The U.S. government agencies responsible for administering the ITAR and the EAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations. The agencies also have significant discretion in approving, denying, or conditioning authorizations to engage in controlled activities. Such decisions are influenced by the U.S. government’s commitments to multilateral export control regimes, particularly the Missile Technology Control Regime concerning the spaceflight business
Many different types of internal controls and measures are required to ensure compliance with such export control rules. In particular, we are required to maintain registration under the ITAR; determine the proper licensing jurisdiction and classification of products, software, and technology; and obtain licenses or other forms of U.S. government authorizations to engage in activities, including the performance by foreign persons, related to and who support our spaceflight business. Under the ITAR and the EAR, we must receive permission to release controlled data to foreign persons or physically ship controlled hardware abroad. 
See “Risk Factors — We are subject to stringent U.S. export and import control laws and regulations. Unfavorable changes in these laws and regulations or U.S. government licensing policies, our failure to secure timely U.S. government authorizations under these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.” The inability to secure and maintain other necessary export authorizations could negatively impact our ability to compete successfully or to operate our spaceflight business as planned. For example, if we were unable to obtain or maintain our licenses to export certain spacecraft hardware, we would be effectively prohibited from launching our vehicles from certain non-U.S. locations, which would limit the number of launch providers we could use. In addition, if we were unable to obtain a Department of State Technical Assistance Agreement to export certain launch provider related services, we would experience difficulties or even be unable to perform integration activities necessary to safely export our transfer vehicles to non-U.S. launch sites. In both cases, these restrictions could lead to higher launch costs which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Similarly, if we were unable to secure effective export licensure to authorize the full scope of activity with a foreign partner or supplier, we may need to implement design changes to spacecraft or updates to our supplier chain, which may increase costs or result in delays in vehicle launch schedules. 
Failure to comply with export control laws and regulations could expose us to civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, more onerous compliance requirements, loss of export privileges, debarment from government contracts, or limitations on our ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. government. In addition, any changes in export control regulations or U.S. government licensing policy, such as that necessary to implement U.S. government commitments to multilateral control regimes, may restrict our operations. 
Interagency Review 
Approval of the licenses described above may be subject to interagency reviews that allow multiple government agencies — the Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of State, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”), and others — to examine the respective applications from their individual perspectives, including safety, operational, national security, and foreign policy and international obligations implications, as well as review of foreign ownership. As discussed above, the interagency process raised national security concerns relating to foreign ownership and control of Momentus in connection with a recent FAA license application. We will continue to engage with the Department of Defense to understand the steps necessary to achieve the resolution of any remaining U.S. government national security concerns. No assurance can be given that we will obtain the licenses described above in this section for our future missions. Even though Momentus has entered into the NSA, there is no guarantee that the FAA and other U.S. government agencies will grant the necessary authorizations. 
National Security Agreement 
In February 2021, Momentus and its co-founder Mikhail Kokorich, with support from Stable Road, submitted a joint notice to CFIUS for review of the historical acquisitions of interests in Momentus by Mr. Kokorich, his wife, and entities that they control in response to concerns of the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) regarding Momentus’ foreign ownership and control. On June 8, 2021, CFIUS’ review of the joint notice relating to historical acquisitions of interests in Momentus by Mr. Kokorich, his wife, and entities that they control concluded when the Company entered into a National Security Agreement with Mr. Kokorich, on behalf of himself and Nortrone Finance S.A. (an entity controlled by Mr. Kokorich), Lev Khasis and Olga Khasis, each in their respective individual capacities and on behalf of Brainyspace LLC (an entity controlled by Olga Khasis), and the U.S. government, represented by the U.S. Departments of Defense and the Treasury (the “NSA”). In accordance with the NSA, on June 8, 2021, Mr. Kokorich, Nortrone Finance S.A, Lev Khasis and his wife Olga Khasis, and Brainyspace LLC, (collectively, the “Momentus Investors”), fully divested all the shares of Momentus securities beneficially owned by them by selling shares back to Momentus. Pursuant to the NSA, a portion of those divestment proceeds were placed in escrow accounts, and may not be released to the divested investors until after completion of audit by a third party auditor of the Momentus Investors compliance with the NSA and the lapse of a 15 day period without an objection from the CFIUS Monitoring Agencies. As a subsequent event, the remaining proceeds were released from escrow to the divested investors, see Note 15 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The NSA also requires, among other things, the following: 
•Appointment of a Security Director approved by the U.S. government, represented by the U.S. Departments of Defense and the Treasury (the “CFIUS Monitoring Agencies”), to serve as the primary liaison between Momentus’ board of directors and the CFIUS Monitoring Agencies, with the Security Director to have authority to oversee Momentus’ compliance with the NSA, including, among other things, to remove and replace Momentus officers and employees, approve all new Momentus directors, and to review, approve and terminate certain contracts and relationships related to access to technology and protected technical information, and to recommend that a director be removed from our board of directors due to an identified national security concern, as determined by the Security Director in consultation with the CFIUS Monitoring Agencies; 
•Appointment of a Security Officer, approved by the CFIUS Monitoring Agencies, to report directly to the Security Director and to have primary responsibility for overseeing day-to-day compliance with the NSA and any compliance plans adopted thereunder, including periodic reporting to the CFIUS Monitoring Agencies; 
•Appointment of an independent third-party monitor to monitor compliance with the NSA by the parties to the NSA, perform due diligence on all persons that are granted access to protected technical information, protected systems or protected facilities, and to serve as a point of contact for the CFIUS Monitoring Agencies under a monitoring agreement. The third-party monitor will regularly report directly to the CFIUS Monitoring Agencies; 
•Appointment of an independent third-party auditor to regularly audit Momentus’ compliance with the NSA, and establishment of an audit plan under which the third-party monitor will conduct such audits; 
•Establishment of certain communications protocols and restrictions to prevent most communications between Momentus personnel and the Momentus Investors; implementation of certain technology controls to prevent access by the Momentus Investors to protected technical information; regular reporting of technical relationships in which Momentus engages; record keeping and communications logging; establishment of a security plan to safeguard protected technical information, protected systems and protected facilities; and training for all Momentus personnel with respect to the security plan and compliance with the NSA; 
•Access and inspection rights for the CFIUS Monitoring Agencies; and 
•Periodic reporting by Momentus and the Momentus Investors to the CFIUS Monitoring Agencies. 
As summarized above and as further set forth in the NSA, Momentus is subject to various requirements under the NSA. Momentus is required to ensure that the Security Director reports any actual or potential violation of the NSA to the CFIUS Monitoring Agencies and the third-party monitor within 24 hours of discovery, and failure to comply with certain requirements under the NSA could subject Momentus to liquidated damages payable to the U.S. government in the amount of $100,000 per day, up to an aggregate amount of $1,000,000 per breach. See “Risk Factors — We are subject to various requirements and restrictions under the NSA we have entered into with the U.S. government, and we are incurring significant costs to comply with those requirements and may be subject to 
significant monetary penalties if we are deemed not to be in compliance with the requirements and restrictions under the NSA.” 
Human Capital 
People are our most important asset. Since its inception, Momentus has sought to recruit creative, positive persons with a diverse set of business capabilities to play an integral role in building our company. As we move into the next stage of our growth, we are devoting more resources to our human capital and are building the infrastructure necessary to support our workforce and promote communication, respect, and diversity among our team. We have established our Human Resources and Talent Acquisition department and have hired a Vice President to lead that group and direct our initiatives as we are deeply committed to continuing to grow and develop our team. As of December 31, 2021, we had 118 employees consisting of 80 employees in our research and development and manufacturing teams, seven employees in our sales and marketing teams and 31 employees in general and administrative functions. Many of our employees bring significant experience from prior positions working for leading defense primes, satellite manufacturers, other commercial and military aerospace companies, and government agencies. 
Facilities 
During 2021, we leased an approximately 65,000-square-foot facility in San Jose, California, which serves as our new headquarters, propulsion laboratory, and Vigoride assembly and test center. This space will allow us to quickly ramp up production volumes for Vigoride vehicles, increase available laboratory space, and accelerate thruster and other developments. We also maintain approximately 13,000 square feet of administrative, research, manufacturing, and testing facilities at our campus in Santa Clara. The campus includes a total of three office suites, two of which consist of solely offices for administrative responsibilities, research and development, and another that consists of both offices and machinery for manufacturing and testing. These facilities are pursuant to agreements through which we lease under multi-year contracts. Leases on two suites were scheduled to terminate at the end of 2021 but have been extended into 2022 as we continue to move operations to our San Jose facility, and the third is scheduled to terminate in November 2022. We plan to launch our orbital vehicles in partnership with various rocket providers, including SpaceX and Relativity Space, among others. Our rocket launch partners will provide the necessary land, facility, and machinery to successfully complete the launches.
