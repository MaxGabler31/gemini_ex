ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Tenet Healthcare Corporation (together with our subsidiaries, referred to herein as “Tenet,” “we” or “us”) is a diversified healthcare services company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Through our subsidiaries, partnerships and joint ventures, including USPI Holding Company, Inc. (“USPI”), at December 31, 2021, we operated an expansive care network that included 60 hospitals and 535 other healthcare facilities, including surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”), imaging centers, off‑campus emergency departments and micro‑hospitals. We also had over 20 ASCs in development at December 31, 2021. In addition, we operate Conifer Health Solutions, LLC through our Conifer Holdings, Inc. subsidiary (“Conifer”), which provides revenue cycle management and value‑based care services to hospitals, health systems, physician practices, employers and other clients. For financial reporting purposes, our business lines are classified into three separate reportable operating segments – Hospital Operations and other (“Hospital Operations”), Ambulatory Care and Conifer. Additional information about our operating segments is provided below; statistical data for the segments can be found in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of Part II of this report (“MD&A”).
In 2021, the ongoing COVID‑19 pandemic significantly impacted, and it continues to affect, all three segments of our business, as well as our patients, communities and employees. As a provider of healthcare services, we are acutely affected by the public health and economic effects of the pandemic. Throughout MD&A, we have provided additional information on the impact of the COVID‑19 pandemic on our results of operations, disclosed certain of the steps we have taken, and are continuing to take, in response, and described various legislative actions that have mitigated some of the economic disruption caused by the pandemic on our business. The ultimate extent and scope of the pandemic and its future impact on our business remain unknown. For information about risks and uncertainties related to COVID‑19 that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we refer you to the Risk Factors section below.
OPERATIONS
HOSPITAL OPERATIONS SEGMENT
Hospitals, Ancillary Outpatient Facilities and Related Businesses—In 2021, we continued to make investments across our Hospital Operations segment to offer more convenient access to higher‑demand and higher‑acuity clinical service lines in the communities we serve. We also exited service lines, businesses and markets that we believe are no longer a core part of our long‑term growth strategy. In April 2021, we divested the majority of our urgent care centers and, in August 2021, we sold five Miami‑area hospitals and certain related operations.
At December 31, 2021, our subsidiaries operated 60 hospitals, serving primarily urban and suburban communities in nine states. Our subsidiaries had sole ownership of 52 of these hospitals, six were owned or leased by entities that are, in turn, majority owned by a Tenet subsidiary, and two were owned by third parties and leased by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Our Hospital Operations segment also included 112 outpatient centers at December 31, 2021, the majority of which are provider‑based and freestanding imaging centers, off‑campus hospital emergency departments, provider‑based ASCs and micro‑hospitals. In addition, at December 31, 2021, our subsidiaries owned or leased and operated: a number of medical office buildings, all of which were located on, or nearby, our hospital campuses; over 750 physician practices; several accountable care organizations and clinically integrated networks; and other ancillary healthcare businesses.
Each of our general hospitals offers acute care services, operating and recovery rooms, radiology services, respiratory therapy services, clinical laboratories and pharmacies; in addition, most have: intensive care, critical care and/or coronary care units; cardiovascular, digestive disease, neurosciences, musculoskeletal and obstetrics services; and outpatient services, including physical therapy. Many of our hospitals provide tertiary care services, such as cardiothoracic surgery, complex spinal surgery, neonatal intensive care and neurosurgery, and some also offer quaternary care in areas such as heart and kidney transplants. Moreover, a number of our hospitals offer advanced treatment options for patients, including limb‑salvaging vascular procedures, acute level 1 trauma services, comprehensive intravascular stroke care, minimally invasive cardiac valve replacement, cutting‑edge imaging technology, and telemedicine access for selected medical specialties.
Each of our hospitals is accredited by The Joint Commission. With such accreditation, our hospitals are deemed to meet the Medicare Conditions of Participation and Conditions for Coverage and are eligible to participate in government‑sponsored provider programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

(1)Operated by a limited liability company formed as part of a joint venture with Baptist Health System, Inc. (“BHS”), a not‑for‑profit health system in Alabama; a Tenet subsidiary owned a 70% interest in the entity at December 31, 2021, and BHS owned a 30% interest.
(2)In order to receive certain tax benefits for these hospitals, which were operated as nonprofit hospitals prior to our joint venture with BHS, we have entered into arrangements with the City of Talladega, the City of Birmingham, the City of Alabaster and the City of Jasper such that a Medical Clinic Board owns each of these hospitals, and the hospitals are leased to our joint venture entity. These capital leases expire between November 2025 and September 2036, but contain two optional renewal terms of 10 years each.
(3)Specialty hospital.
(4)Designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) as a critical access hospital.
(5)Lease expires in May 2027.
(6)Lease expires in July 2045.
(7)Owned by a limited liability company formed as part of a joint venture with John Muir Health (“JMH”), a not‑for‑profit health system in the San Francisco Bay area; a Tenet subsidiary owned a 51% interest in the entity at December 31, 2021, and JMH owned a 49% interest.
Information regarding the utilization of licensed beds and other operating statistics at December 31, 2021 and 2020 can be found in MD&A.
At December 31, 2021, our Hospital Operations segment also included 43 imaging centers, 14 off‑campus emergency departments and 10 ASCs operated as departments of our hospitals and under the same license, as well as 45 separately licensed, freestanding outpatient centers – typically at locations complementary to our hospitals – consisting of 26 imaging centers, 15 emergency facilities (14 of which are licensed as micro‑hospitals), two ASCs and two urgent care centers. Approximately half of the outpatient centers in our Hospital Operations segment at December 31, 2021 were in Texas and California, the same states where we had the largest concentrations of licensed hospital beds. Strong concentrations of hospital beds and outpatient centers within market areas may help us contract more successfully with managed care payers, reduce management, marketing and other expenses, and more efficiently utilize resources. However, these concentrations increase the risk that, should any adverse economic, regulatory, environmental, competitive or other condition (including COVID‑19 surges) occur in these areas, our overall business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
Accountable Care Organizations and Clinically Integrated Networks—We own, control or operate three accountable care organizations (“ACOs”) and four clinically integrated networks (“CINs”) – in Alabama, Arizona, California, Massachusetts and Texas – and participate in an additional ACO and an additional CIN with other healthcare providers for select markets in Arizona. An ACO is a group of providers and suppliers that work together to redesign delivery processes in an effort to achieve high‑quality and efficient provision of services under contract with CMS. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. A CIN coordinates the healthcare needs of the communities served by its network of providers with the purpose of improving the quality and efficiency of healthcare services through collaborative programs, including contracts with managed care payers that create a high degree of interdependence and cooperation among the network providers. Because they promote accountability and coordination of care, ACOs and CINs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiencies.
AMBULATORY CARE SEGMENT
Our Ambulatory Care segment is comprised of USPI’s ambulatory surgery centers and surgical hospitals. At December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 95% of USPI, and Baylor University Medical Center (“Baylor”) owned approximately 5%. We continue to focus on opportunities to expand our Ambulatory Care segment through acquisitions, organic growth, construction of new outpatient centers and strategic partnerships. In December 2021, in connection with the closing of a previously announced transaction with Surgical Center Development #3, LLC and Surgical Center Development #4, LLC (“SCD”), subsidiaries of USPI acquired SCD’s ownership interests in 86 musculoskeletal‑focused ASCs, along with other related ambulatory support services. In an effort to attain a majority ownership position in certain of the ASCs to consolidate their financial results, USPI has separately made offers, and continues to make offers in an ongoing process, to acquire a portion of the equity interests from the physician owners; USPI acquired such equity interests in 10 centers prior to the end of 2021. At December 31, 2021, USPI had interests in a total of 399 ASCs and 24 surgical hospitals in 34 states.
Also as previously announced, USPI and SCD’s principals have entered into a joint venture and development agreement under which USPI will have the exclusive option to partner with affiliates of SCD on the future development of a minimum target of 50 de novo ASCs over a period of five years. We believe that these transactions will enable us to continue to sharpen our focus on the growth and expansion of ambulatory surgical services.
Operations of USPI—USPI acquires and develops its facilities primarily through the formation of joint ventures with physicians and health systems. USPI’s subsidiaries hold ownership interests in the facilities directly or indirectly and operate the facilities on a day‑to‑day basis through management services contracts. USPI does not currently have management services contracts for the SCD facilities acquired in December 2021 in which it owns only a minority interest.
We believe USPI’s ASCs and surgical hospitals offer many advantages to patients and physicians, including increased affordability, predictability and convenience. USPI’s facilities generally provide physicians with greater scheduling flexibility, more consistent nurse staffing and faster turnaround times between cases than they could expect in an acute care hospital setting. In addition, we believe many physicians choose to perform surgery in USPI’s facilities because their patients prefer the comfort of a less institutional atmosphere and the expediency of simplified registration and discharge procedures. USPI’s facilities also serve as an alternative point‑of‑service as acute care hospitals manage their capacity during the COVID‑19 pandemic and otherwise.
New surgical techniques and technology, as well as advances in anesthesia, have significantly expanded the types of surgical procedures that are being performed in surgery centers and have helped drive growth in outpatient surgery. Improved anesthesia has shortened recovery time by minimizing post‑operative side effects, such as nausea and drowsiness, thereby preventing the need for overnight hospitalization in many cases. In addition, certain complex surgeries, previously performed only in an inpatient setting, are now capable of being performed in a surgery center.
In addition to these technological and clinical advancements, a changing payer environment has contributed to the growth of outpatient surgery relative to all surgery performed. Government programs, private insurance companies, managed care organizations and self‑insured employers have implemented cost‑containment measures to limit increases in healthcare expenditures, including procedure reimbursement. Furthermore, self‑funded employers continue to shift additional financial responsibility to patients through higher co‑pays, deductibles and premium contributions to curb annual increases in their employee health benefits costs. These cost‑containment measures have contributed to the shift in the delivery of certain healthcare services away from traditional acute care hospitals to more cost‑effective alternate sites, including surgery centers and surgical hospitals. We believe that surgeries performed at surgery centers and surgical hospitals are generally less expensive than acute care hospital‑based outpatient surgeries because of lower facility development costs, more efficient staffing and space utilization, and a specialized operating environment focused on quality of care and cost containment. In general, we believe that our focus on quality of care has a positive impact on, among other things, physician and patient satisfaction, as well as our revenues as governmental and private payers continue to move to pay‑for‑performance models.
We operate USPI’s facilities, structure our joint ventures, and adopt staffing, scheduling, and clinical systems and protocols with the goal of increasing physician productivity. We believe that this focus on physician satisfaction, combined with providing high‑quality healthcare in a friendly and convenient environment for patients, will continue to increase the number of procedures performed at our facilities over time. Our joint ventures also enable health systems to offer patients, physicians and payers the cost advantages, convenience and other benefits of ambulatory care in a freestanding facility and, in certain markets, establish networks needed to manage the full continuum of care for a defined population. Further, these relationships allow the health systems to focus their attention and resources on their core business without the challenge of acquiring, developing and operating these facilities.
CONIFER SEGMENT
Nearly all of the services comprising the operations of our Conifer segment are provided by Conifer Health Solutions, LLC or one of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, we owned 76.2% of Conifer Health Solutions, LLC, and Catholic Health Initiatives (“CHI”) had a 23.8% ownership position. (As a result of its 2019 merger with Dignity Health, CHI is now a part of CommonSpirit Health.) Following exploration of strategic alternatives for Conifer, in July 2019, we announced our intention to pursue a tax‑free spin‑off of Conifer as a separate, independent, publicly traded company. Completion of the potential spin‑off is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, assurance that the separation will be tax‑free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, execution of a comprehensive amendment to and restatement of the master services agreement between Conifer and Tenet, finalization of Conifer’s capital structure, the effectiveness of appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and final approval from our board of directors. If consummated, the spin-off is expected to potentially enhance shareholder value and, to a lesser degree, reduce the level of our debt through a tax-free debt-for-debt exchange. There can be no assurance regarding the timeframe for completion of the Conifer spin‑off, the allocation of assets and liabilities between Tenet and Conifer, that the other conditions of the spin‑off will be met, or that it will be completed at all.
Services—Conifer provides comprehensive end‑to‑end and focused‑point business process services, including hospital and physician revenue cycle management, patient communications and engagement support, and value‑based care solutions, to hospitals, health systems, physician practices, employers and other clients.
Conifer’s revenue cycle management solutions consist of: (1) patient services, including: centralized insurance and benefit verification; financial clearance, pre‑certification, registration and check‑in services; and financial counseling services, including reviews of eligibility for government healthcare or financial assistance programs, for both insured and uninsured patients, as well as qualified health plan coverage; (2) clinical revenue integrity solutions, including: clinical admission reviews; coding; clinical documentation improvement; coding compliance audits; charge description master management; and health information services; and (3) accounts receivable management solutions, including: third‑party billing and collections; denials management; and patient collections. All of these solutions include ongoing measurement and monitoring of key revenue cycle metrics, as well as productivity and quality improvement programs. These revenue cycle management solutions assist hospitals, physician practices and other healthcare organizations in improving cash flow, revenue, and physician and patient satisfaction.
In addition, Conifer offers customized communications and engagement solutions to optimize the relationship between providers and patients. Conifer’s trained customer service representatives provide direct, 24‑hour, multilingual support for (1) physician referral requests, calls regarding maternity services and other patient inquiries, (2) community education and outreach, and (3) scheduling and appointment reminders. Additionally, Conifer coordinates and implements marketing outreach programs to keep patients informed of screenings, seminars, and other events and services.
Conifer also offers value‑based care solutions, including clinical integration, financial risk management and population health management, all of which assist hospitals, physicians, ACOs, health plans, self‑insured employers and government agencies in improving the cost and quality of healthcare delivery, as well as patient outcomes. Conifer helps clients build CINs that provide predictive analytics and quality measures across the care continuum. In addition, Conifer helps clients align and manage financial incentives among healthcare stakeholders through risk modeling and administration of various payment models. Furthermore, Conifer offers clients tools and analytics to improve quality of care and provide care management services for patients with chronic diseases by identifying high‑risk patients, coordinating with patients and clinicians in managing care, and monitoring clinical outcomes.
Clients—At December 31, 2021, Conifer provided one or more of the business process services described above to approximately 650 Tenet and non‑Tenet hospital and other clients nationwide. Tenet and CHI facilities represented approximately 45% of these clients, and the remainder were unaffiliated health systems, hospitals, physician practices, self‑insured organizations, health plans and other entities. In 2012, we entered into an agreement documenting the terms and conditions of various services Conifer provides to Tenet hospitals (“RCM Agreement”), as well as an agreement documenting certain administrative services our Hospital Operations segment provides to Conifer. In March 2021, we entered into a month‑to‑month agreement amending the RCM Agreement effective January 1, 2021 (“Amended RCM Agreement”) to update certain terms and conditions related to the revenue cycle management services Conifer provides to Tenet hospitals. We believe the pricing terms for the services provided under the Amended RCM Agreement are commercially reasonable and consistent with estimated third-party terms. As noted above, execution of restructured long‑term services agreements between Conifer and Tenet is a condition to completion of the proposed spin‑off. Conifer’s agreement with CHI to provide patient access, revenue integrity, accounts receivable management and patient financial services to CHI’s facilities expires on December 31, 2032. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 38% of Conifer’s net operating revenues were attributable to its relationship with Tenet and 45% were attributable to its relationship with CHI. We are continuing to market Conifer’s revenue cycle management, patient communications and engagement services, and value‑based care solutions businesses. The timing and uncertainty associated with our spin‑off plans for Conifer may have an adverse impact on our ability to secure new clients for Conifer.
REAL PROPERTY
The locations of our hospitals and the number of licensed beds at each hospital at December 31, 2021 are set forth in the table beginning on page 2. We lease the majority of our outpatient facilities in both our Hospital Operations segment and our Ambulatory Care segment. These leases typically have initial terms ranging from five to 20 years, and most of the leases contain options to extend the lease periods. Our subsidiaries also operate a number of medical office buildings, all of which are located on, or nearby, our hospital campuses. We own many of these medical office buildings; the remainder are owned by third parties and leased by our subsidiaries.
Our corporate headquarters are located in Dallas, Texas. In addition, we maintain administrative offices in regions where we operate hospitals and other businesses, as well as our Global Business Center in the Philippines. We typically lease our office space under operating lease agreements. We believe that all of our properties are suitable for their respective uses and are, in general, adequate for our present needs.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
PHYSICIANS
Our operations depend in large part on the number, quality, specialties, and admitting and scheduling practices of the licensed physicians who are members of the medical staffs of our hospitals and other facilities, as well as physicians who affiliate with us and use our facilities as an extension of their practices. Under state laws and other licensing standards, medical staffs are generally self‑governing organizations subject to ultimate oversight by the facility’s local governing board. Members of the medical staffs of our facilities also often serve on the medical staffs of facilities we do not operate, and they are free to terminate their association with our facilities or admit their patients to competing facilities at any time. At December 31, 2021, we owned over 750 physician practices, and our subsidiaries employed (where permitted by state law) or otherwise affiliated with over 1,500 physicians; however, we have no contractual relationship with the overwhelming majority of the physicians who practice at our hospitals and outpatient centers.
It is essential to our ongoing business and clinical program development that we attract an appropriate number of quality physicians in the specialties required to support our services and that we maintain good relations with those physicians. In 2021, we continued to experience challenges in recruiting and retaining physicians as a result of the prioritization of COVID‑19 care and the challenges associated with relocating physicians during the pandemic. In some of our markets, physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of qualified physicians in certain higher-demand clinical service lines and specialties. Moreover, our ability to recruit and employ physicians is closely regulated.
EMPLOYEES
We believe each employee across our network has a role integral to our mission, which is to provide quality, compassionate care in the communities we serve. At December 31, 2021, our subsidiaries and affiliates employed approximately 101,100 people (of which approximately 24% were part‑time employees) in our three operating segments, as follows:

Hospital Operations | 70,000 
Ambulatory Care | 20,200 
Conifer | 10,900 
Total | 101,100

At December 31, 2021, our employee headcount had decreased by nearly 9,000 employees as compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to the divestiture of five hospitals in Florida and our urgent care business in 2021. At December 31, 2021, we had employees in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, as well as over 2,000 employees providing support across our entire network at our Global Business Center in the Philippines. Approximately 31% of our employees are nurses.
Board Oversight—Our board of directors and its committees oversee human capital matters through regular reports from management and advisors. The board’s human resources committee (“HR Committee”) is responsible for establishing general compensation policies that (1) support our overall business strategies and objectives, (2) enhance our efforts to attract and retain skilled employees, (3) link compensation with our business objectives and organizational performance, and (4) provide competitive compensation opportunities for key executives. The HR Committee also provides, among other things, its perspectives regarding performance management, succession planning, leadership development, diversity, recruiting, retention and employee training. The board’s environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) committee, which was formed in 2021, provides oversight with respect to our ESG strategy and guidance on ESG matters, including human rights, diversity and inclusion, and other ESG issues that are relevant to our business.
Human Resources Practices—We have established – and continue to enhance and refine – a comprehensive set of practices for recruiting, managing and optimizing the human resources of our organization. In many cases, we utilize objective benchmarking and other tools in our efforts, including a commercial product that is widely used in the healthcare industry and provides metrics in such areas as organizational effectiveness, voluntary turnover and staffing efficiencies.
Compensation and Benefits; Culture—In general, we seek to attract, develop and retain an engaged workforce, cultivate a high‑performance culture that embraces data‑driven decision‑making, and improve talent management processes to promote diversity and inclusion. To that end, we offer:
•a competitive range of compensation and benefit programs designed to reward performance and promote well‑being;
•opportunities for continuing education and advancement through a broad range of clinical training and leadership development experiences, including in‑person and online courses and mentoring opportunities;
•a supportive, inclusive and patient‑centered culture based on respect for others;
•company‑sponsored efforts encouraging and recognizing volunteerism and community service; and
•a code of conduct that promotes integrity, accountability and transparency, among other high ethical standards.
Employee Safety and Welfare—We believe our employees comprise a community built on care, and we place a high priority on maintaining a secure and healthy workplace for them. We promote a culture of safety and reporting by connecting 
employee safety policies with patient safety policies, and we review and refine the policies regularly. At our hospitals, outpatient facilities, and other care sites and clinics, we align staffing to need in our nursing units, and we invest in appropriate training to improve the competency of our caregivers. With the onset of the pandemic, we instituted COVID-safe infrastructure and heightened our infection-prevention protocols. We maintain consistent availability of personal protective equipment and disinfection supplies, and we regularly provide concise and current infection prevention guidance.
We also offer resources to help employees manage challenging circumstances, including a comprehensive employee assistance program comprised of counseling services, financial guidance and legal aid. The Tenet Care Fund (the “Care Fund”) is a 501(c)(3) public charity that provides financial assistance to our employees who have experienced hardship due to, among other things, natural disasters, extended illness or injury, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Care Fund is funded primarily by our employees for our employees.
Diversity and Inclusion—We continue to focus on the hiring, advancement and retention of underrepresented populations to further our objective of fostering an engaging culture with a workforce and leadership teams that represent the markets we serve. As of December 31, 2021, our total workforce was greater than 75% female, and nearly 50% of our employees self‑identified as racially or ethnically diverse. Over 55% of new employees (i.e., those we hired in 2021) self‑identified as racially or ethnically diverse.
We have a Diversity Council, which consists of leaders representing different facets of our enterprise, to support our overall diversity and inclusion efforts, including in the areas of recruiting, talent development, new‑hire mentoring, community partnerships, and educational opportunities. The Diversity Council works to provide tools, guidelines and training with respect to best practices in these areas. In 2021, the Diversity Council provided oversight to our human resources department in the development and implementation of an enterprise-wide inclusive culture training session. In addition, the Diversity Council is in the process of setting up employee resource groups to support team members with similar backgrounds or shared interests. Each employee resource group has an executive sponsor to help in setting a unique mission and operating model.
Competition; Staffing Ratio Requirements—We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel responsible for the operation of our facilities. There is a limited availability of experienced medical support personnel nationwide, which drives up the wages and benefits required to recruit and retain employees. In particular, like others in the healthcare industry, we continue to experience a shortage of critical‑care nurses in certain disciplines and geographic areas. This shortage has been exacerbated by the COVID‑19 pandemic as more nurses choose to retire early, leave the workforce or take travel assignments. In some areas, the increased demand for care of COVID‑19 patients in our hospitals, as well as the direct impact of COVID‑19 on physicians, employees and their families, have put a strain on our resources and staff. Over the past two years, we have had to rely on higher-cost temporary and contract labor, which we compete with other healthcare providers to secure, and pay premiums above standard compensation for essential workers.
California is the only state in which we operate that requires minimum nurse‑to‑patient staffing ratios to be maintained at all times in acute care hospitals. If other states in which we operate adopt mandatory nurse‑staffing ratios, it could have a significant effect on our labor costs and have an adverse impact on our net operating revenues if we are required to limit patient volumes in order to meet the required ratios.
Union Activity and Labor Relations—At December 31, 2021, approximately 27% of the employees in our Hospital Operations segment were represented by labor unions. Less than 1% of the total employees in both our Ambulatory Care and Conifer segments belong to a union. Unionized employees – primarily registered nurses and service, technical and maintenance workers – are located at 33 of our hospitals, the majority of which are in California, Florida and Michigan. Organizing activities by labor unions could increase our level of union representation in future periods, which could impact our labor costs.
When we are negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions (whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts), work stoppages and strikes may occur, as they did at one of our hospitals in 2021. Although relatively uncommon, extended strikes have had, and could in the future have, an adverse effect on our patient volumes, net operating revenues and labor costs at individual hospitals or in local markets.
COMPETITION
HEALTHCARE SERVICES
We believe our hospitals and outpatient facilities compete within local communities on the basis of many factors, including: quality of care; location and ease of access; the scope and breadth of services offered; reputation; and the caliber of the facilities, equipment and employees. In addition, the competitive positions of hospitals and outpatient facilities depend in large part on the number, quality, specialties, and admitting and scheduling practices of the licensed physicians who are members of the medical staffs of those facilities, as well as physicians who affiliate with and use outpatient centers as an extension of their practices. Physicians often serve on the medical staffs of more than one facility, and they are typically free to terminate their association with such facilities or admit their patients to competing facilities at any time.
Some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by tax‑supported government agencies, and many others are owned by not‑for‑profit organizations that may have financial advantages not available to our facilities, including (1) support through endowments, charitable contributions and tax revenues, (2) access to tax‑exempt financing, and (3) exemptions from sales, property and income taxes. In addition, in certain markets in which we operate, large teaching hospitals provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at most of our hospitals. Trends toward clinical and pricing transparency may also impact a healthcare facility’s competitive position in ways that are difficult to predict.
The existence or absence of state laws that require findings of need for construction and expansion of healthcare facilities or services (as described in “Healthcare Regulation and Licensing – Certificate of Need Requirements” below) may also impact competition. In recent years, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. Some of these facilities are physician‑owned. Moreover, we expect to encounter additional competition from system‑affiliated hospitals and healthcare companies, as well as health insurers and private equity companies seeking to acquire providers, in specific geographic markets in the future.
Another major factor in the competitive position of a hospital or outpatient facility is the scope of its relationships with managed care plans. Health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”), third‑party administrators, and other third‑party payers use managed care contracts to encourage patients to use certain hospitals in exchange for discounts from the hospitals’ established charges. Generally, we compete for managed care contracts on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, caliber of the medical staff and convenience. Other healthcare providers may affect our ability to enter into acceptable managed care contractual arrangements or negotiate increases in our reimbursement. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. Vertical integration efforts involving third‑party payers and healthcare providers, among other factors, may increase competitive challenges.
Our strategies are designed to help our hospitals and outpatient facilities remain competitive, to attract and retain an appropriate number of physicians of distinction in various specialties, as well as skilled clinical personnel and other healthcare professionals, and to increase patient volumes. To that end, we have made significant investments in equipment, technology, education and operational strategies designed to improve clinical quality at all of our facilities. In addition, we continually collaborate with physicians to implement the most current evidence‑based medicine techniques to improve the way we provide care, while using labor management tools and supply‑chain initiatives to reduce variable costs. Moreover, we participate in various value‑based programs to improve quality and cost of care. We believe the use of these practices will promote the most effective and efficient utilization of resources and result in more appropriate lengths of stay, as well as reductions in readmissions for hospitalized patients. In general, we believe that quality of care improvements may have the effects of: (1) reducing costs; (2) increasing payments from Medicare and certain managed care payers for our services as governmental and private payers continue to move to pay‑for‑performance models, and the commercial market continues to move to more narrow networks and other methods designed to encourage covered individuals to use certain facilities over others; and (3) increasing physician and patient satisfaction, which may improve our volumes. It should be noted, however, that we do face competition from other health systems that are implementing similar strategies.
In addition, we have significantly increased our focus on operating our outpatient centers with improved accessibility and more convenient service for patients, increased predictability and efficiency for physicians, and (for most services) lower costs for payers than would be incurred with a hospital visit. We believe that emphasis on higher‑demand clinical service lines (including outpatient services), focus on expanding our ambulatory care business, cultivation of our culture of service and participation in Medicare Advantage health plans that have been experiencing higher growth rates than traditional Medicare, among other strategies, will also help us address competitive challenges in our markets.
We also recognize that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and renew our existing managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on competitive terms. To bolster our competitive position, we have sought to include all of our hospitals and other healthcare businesses in the related geographic area or nationally when negotiating new managed care contracts, which may result in additional volumes at facilities that were not previously a part of such managed care networks. We also continue to engage in contracting strategies that create shared value with payers.
REVENUE CYCLE MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS
Conifer faces competition from existing participants and new entrants to the revenue cycle management business, some of which may have significantly greater capital resources than Conifer. In addition, the internal revenue cycle management staff of hospitals and other healthcare providers, who perform many of the functions addressed by our services, in effect compete with us. Moreover, providers who have previously made investments in internally developed solutions may choose to continue to rely on their own resources. We also currently compete with several categories of external participants who offer revenue cycle services, including: software vendors and other technology‑supported revenue cycle management business process outsourcing companies; traditional consultants, either specialized healthcare consulting firms or healthcare divisions of large accounting firms; and large, non‑healthcare focused business process and information technology outsourcing firms.
We believe that competition for the revenue cycle management and other services Conifer provides is based primarily on: (1) knowledge and understanding of the complex public and private healthcare payment and reimbursement systems; (2) a track record of delivering revenue improvements and efficiency gains for hospitals and other healthcare providers; (3) the ability to deliver solutions that are fully integrated along each step of the revenue cycle; (4) cost‑effectiveness, including the breakdown between up‑front costs and pay‑for‑performance incentive compensation; (5) reliability, simplicity and flexibility of the technology platform; (6) understanding of the healthcare industry’s regulatory environment, as well as laws and regulations relating to consumer protection; and (7) financial resources to maintain current technology and other infrastructure.
To be successful, Conifer must respond more quickly and effectively than its competitors to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, regulations and client requirements. Existing or new competitors may introduce technologies or services that render Conifer’s technologies or services obsolete or less marketable. Even if Conifer’s technologies and services are more effective than the offerings of its competitors, current or potential clients might prefer competitive technologies or services to Conifer’s technologies and services. Furthermore, increased competition has resulted and may continue to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact Conifer’s margins, growth rate or market share. In addition, the timing and uncertainty regarding our potential spin‑off of Conifer may have an adverse impact on Conifer’s ability to secure new clients.
HEALTHCARE REGULATION AND LICENSING
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (“Affordable Care Act” or “ACA”) extended health coverage to millions of uninsured legal U.S. residents through a combination of private sector health insurance reforms and public program expansion. To fund the expansion of insurance coverage, the ACA includes measures designed to promote quality and cost efficiency in healthcare delivery and to generate budgetary savings in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, the ACA contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement.
The initial expansion of health insurance coverage under the ACA resulted in an increase in the number of patients using our facilities with either private or public program coverage and a decrease in uninsured and charity care admissions. Although a substantial portion of our patient volumes and, as a result, our revenues has historically been derived from government healthcare programs, reductions to our reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs as a result of the ACA have been partially offset by increased revenues from providing care to previously uninsured individuals.
The healthcare industry, in general, and the acute care hospital business, in particular, have experienced significant regulatory uncertainty based, in large part, on administrative, legislative and judicial efforts to limit, alter or repeal the ACA. Since 2010, various states, private entities and individuals have challenged parts or all of the ACA numerous times in state and federal courts, and the U.S. Supreme Court has issued decisions in three such cases, most recently in June 2021. Various state legislatures have also challenged parts or all of the ACA through legislation, while other states have acted to safeguard the ACA by codifying certain provisions into state law. We cannot predict what future action, if any, Congress might take with respect to the ACA. Furthermore, we are unable to predict the impact on our future revenues and operations of (1) court challenges to the 
ACA, (2) administrative, regulatory and legislative changes, including the possibility of expansion of government‑sponsored coverage, or (3) market reactions to those changes. However, if the ultimate impact is that significantly fewer individuals have private or public health coverage, we likely will experience decreased patient volumes, reduced revenues and an increase in uncompensated care, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
ANTI-KICKBACK AND SELF-REFERRAL REGULATIONS
Anti‑Kickback Statute—Medicare and Medicaid anti‑kickback and anti‑fraud and abuse amendments codified under Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the “Anti‑kickback Statute”) proscribe certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services payable under the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other government programs. Specifically, the law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase or order of any item, good, facility or service covered by these programs. In addition to addressing other matters, as discussed below, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) also amended Title XI (42 U.S.C. Section 1301 et seq.) to broaden the scope of fraud and abuse laws to include all health plans, whether or not payments under such health plans are made pursuant to a federal program. Moreover, the Affordable Care Act amended the Anti‑kickback Statute to provide that intent to violate the Anti-kickback Statute is not required; rather, intent to violate the law generally is all that is required.
Sanctions for violating the Anti‑kickback Statute include criminal and civil penalties, as well as fines and mandatory exclusion from government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the Anti‑kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim and may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). Furthermore, it is a violation of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMPL”) to offer or transfer anything of value to Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries that is likely to influence their decision to obtain covered goods or services from one provider or service over another. Many states have statutes similar to the federal Anti‑kickback Statute, except that the state statutes usually apply to referrals for services reimbursed by all third‑party payers, not just federal programs.
The federal government has also issued regulations – referred to as the “Safe Harbor” regulations – that describe some of the conduct and business relationships that are permissible under the Anti‑kickback Statute. Historically, Safe Harbors for various activities have included the following: investment interests; space rental; equipment rental; practitioner recruitment; personal services and management contracts; sales of practices; referral services; warranties; discounts; employees; group purchasing organizations; waivers of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts; managed care arrangements; obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies; investments in group practices; ASCs; referral agreements for specialty services; cost‑sharing waivers for pharmacies and emergency ambulance services; and local transportation. In December 2020, the HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) published new rules (the “2020 AKS and CMPL Update”) that updated the Safe Harbor regulations and the CMPL. The 2020 AKS and CMPL Update modified existing Safe Harbors and added new Safe Harbors, as well as a new CMPL exception to remove barriers to more effective coordination and management of patient care and delivery of value‑based care. The 2020 AKS and CMPL Update includes: three new Safe Harbors to protect certain payments among individuals and entities in a value‑based arrangement; a Safe Harbor to protect certain remuneration provided in connection with CMS‑sponsored models; a Safe Harbor to protect donations of cybersecurity technology; and a Safe Harbor to protect the furnishing of certain tools and support to patients in order to improve quality, health outcomes and efficiency. The fact that certain conduct or a given business arrangement does not meet a Safe Harbor does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti‑kickback Statute. Rather, such conduct and business arrangements may be subject to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
Stark Law—The Stark law generally restricts physician referrals of Medicare or Medicaid patients to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, unless one of several exceptions applies. The referral prohibition applies to a number of statutorily defined “designated health services,” such as clinical laboratory, physical therapy, radiology, and inpatient and outpatient hospital services; the prohibition does not apply to health services provided by an ASC if those services are included in the ASC’s composite Medicare payment rate. However, if the ASC is separately billing Medicare for designated health services that are not covered under its composite Medicare payment rate, or if either the ASC or an affiliated physician is performing (and billing Medicare) for procedures that involve designated health services that Medicare has not designated as an ASC service, the Stark law’s self‑referral prohibition would apply and such services could implicate the Stark law. Exceptions to the Stark law’s referral prohibition cover a broad range of common financial relationships. These statutory and the subsequent regulatory exceptions are available to protect certain permitted employment relationships, relocation arrangements, leases, group practice arrangements, medical directorships, and other ordinary relationships between physicians and providers of designated health services, such as hospitals. In December 2020, CMS published new rules (the “2020 Stark Law Update”) that include new exceptions for: certain value‑based compensation 
arrangements between or among physicians, providers and suppliers; limited remuneration to a physician for the provision of items and services without the need for a signed writing and compensation that is set in advance if certain conditions are met; and the protection of arrangements involving the donation of certain cybersecurity technology and related services, including certain cybersecurity hardware donations. The 2020 Stark Law Update also includes several new rules and clarifications to existing Stark Law regulations and key definitions intended to clarify some of the more challenging aspects of Stark Law compliance. CMS explained that the purpose of the 2020 Stark Law Update is to modernize and clarify the regulations to support the innovation necessary for a healthcare delivery and payment system that pays for value and to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on physicians and other healthcare providers and suppliers, while reinforcing the physician self‑referral law’s goal of protecting against program and patient abuse.
A violation of the Stark law may result in a denial of payment, required refunds to patients and the Medicare program, civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 for each violation, civil monetary penalties of up to $100,000 for “sham” arrangements, civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day that an entity fails to report required information, and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal programs. In addition, the submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the Stark law may constitute a false or fraudulent claim, and thus be subject to additional penalties under the FCA. Many states have adopted self‑referral statutes similar to the Stark law, some of which extend beyond the related state Medicaid program to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self‑referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care. Our participation in and development of joint ventures and other financial relationships with physicians could be adversely affected by the Stark law and similar state enactments.
The Affordable Care Act also made changes to the “whole hospital” exception in the Stark law, effectively preventing new physician‑owned hospitals after March 23, 2010 and limiting the capacity and amount of physician ownership in then‑existing physician‑owned hospitals. As revised, the Stark law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to a hospital in which they have an ownership or investment interest unless the hospital had physician ownership and a Medicare provider agreement as of March 23, 2010 (or, for those hospitals under development at the time of the ACA’s enactment, as of December 31, 2010). A physician‑owned hospital that meets these requirements is still subject to restrictions that limit the hospital’s aggregate physician ownership percentage and, with certain narrow exceptions for hospitals with a high percentage of Medicaid patients, prohibit expansion of the number of operating rooms, procedure rooms or beds. Physician‑owned hospitals are also currently subject to reporting requirements and extensive disclosure requirements on the hospital’s website and in any public advertisements.
Implications of Fraud and Abuse Laws—At December 31, 2021, the majority of the facilities that operate as surgical hospitals in our Ambulatory Care segment are owned by joint ventures that include some physician owners and are subject to the limitations and requirements in the Affordable Care Act on physician‑owned hospitals. Furthermore, the majority of ASCs in our Ambulatory Care segment, which are owned by joint ventures with physicians and/or health systems, are subject to the Anti‑kickback Statute and, in certain circumstances, may be subject to the Stark law. In addition, we have contracts with physicians and non‑physician referral services providing for a variety of financial arrangements, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements, such as medical director agreements. We have also provided financial incentives to recruit physicians to relocate to communities served by our hospitals, including income and collection guarantees and reimbursement of relocation costs, and intend to continue to provide recruitment packages in the future. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the government will not challenge new payment structures, such as ACOs and other arrangements involving combinations of hospitals, physicians and other providers who share payment savings, under anti‑kickback and self‑referral provisions, although this risk has been reduced as a result of the 2020 AKS and CMPL Update and the 2020 Stark Law Update, which updates are intended to remove potential federal regulatory barriers to care coordination and value‑based care.
Our operations could be adversely affected should our arrangements fail to comply with the Anti‑kickback Statute, the Stark law, billing requirements, current state laws, or other legislation or regulations in these areas adopted in the future. We are unable to predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level in any of these areas will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or how they may impact our operations. For example, we cannot predict whether physicians may ultimately be restricted from holding ownership interests in hospitals or whether the exception relating to services provided by ASCs could be eliminated. We are continuing to enter into new financial arrangements with physicians and other providers in a manner we believe complies with applicable anti‑kickback and anti‑fraud and abuse laws. However, governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws may nevertheless assert that we are in violation of these provisions. In addition, these statutes or regulations may be interpreted and enforced by the courts in a manner that is not consistent with our interpretation. An adverse determination could subject us to liabilities under the Social Security Act, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any 
determination by a federal or state agency or court that USPI or its subsidiaries has violated any of these laws could give certain of our joint venture partners a right to terminate their relationships with us; and any similar determination with respect to Conifer or any of its subsidiaries could give Conifer’s clients the right to terminate their services agreements with us. Moreover, any violations by and resulting penalties or exclusions imposed upon USPI’s joint venture partners or Conifer’s clients could adversely affect their financial condition and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT
Title II, Subtitle F of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act mandates the adoption of specific standards for electronic transactions and code sets that are used to transmit certain types of health information. HIPAA’s objective is to encourage efficiency and reduce the cost of operations within the healthcare industry. To protect the information transmitted using the mandated standards and the patient information used in the daily operations of a covered entity, HIPAA also sets forth federal rules protecting the privacy and security of protected health information (“PHI”). The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information and the rights of patients to understand and control how their information is used and disclosed. The law provides both criminal and civil fines and penalties for covered entities that fail to comply with HIPAA.
To receive reimbursement from CMS for electronic claims, healthcare providers and health plans must use HIPAA’s electronic data transmission (transaction and code set) standards when transmitting certain healthcare information electronically. Our electronic data transmissions are compliant with current HHS standards for additional electronic transactions and with HHS’ operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction.
Under HIPAA, covered entities must establish administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf. The covered entities we operate are in material compliance with the privacy, security and National Provider Identifier requirements of HIPAA. In addition, most of Conifer’s clients are covered entities, and Conifer is a business associate to many of those clients under HIPAA as a result of its contractual obligations to perform certain functions on behalf of and provide certain services to those clients. As a business associate, Conifer’s use and disclosure of PHI is restricted by HIPAA and the business associate agreements Conifer is required to enter into with its covered entity clients.
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act imposed certain of the HIPAA privacy and security requirements directly upon business associates of covered entities and significantly increased the monetary penalties for violations of HIPAA. Regulations also require business associates such as Conifer to notify covered entities, who in turn must notify affected individuals and government authorities, of data security breaches involving unsecured PHI. Since the passage of the HITECH Act, enforcement of HIPAA violations has increased. If Conifer knowingly breaches the HIPAA privacy and security requirements made applicable to business associates by the HITECH Act, it could expose Conifer to criminal liability (as well as contractual liability to the associated covered entity); a breach of safeguards and processes that is not due to a reasonable cause or involves willful neglect could expose Conifer to significant civil penalties and the possibility of civil litigation under HIPAA and applicable state law.
We have developed a comprehensive set of policies and procedures in our efforts to comply with HIPAA, and similar state privacy laws, under the guidance of our ethics and compliance department. Our compliance officers and information security officers are responsible for implementing and monitoring enterprise-wide compliance with our HIPAA privacy and security policies and procedures. We have also created an internal web‑based HIPAA training program, which is mandatory for all employees. Based on existing regulations and our experience with HIPAA to this point, we continue to believe that the ongoing costs of complying with HIPAA will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
THE NO SURPRISES ACT
The No Surprises Act was signed into law in December 2020 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. The No Surprises Act is intended to address unexpected gaps in insurance coverage that result in “surprise medical bills” when patients unknowingly obtain medical services from physicians and other providers outside their health insurance network, including certain emergency services, anesthesiology services and air ambulance transportation. The protections of the No Surprises Act went into effect on January 1, 2022. As a result, patients will be liable only for their in‑network cost‑sharing amount, and insurers and providers will be given the opportunity to resolve disputed out‑of‑network reimbursement through negotiation and an independent dispute resolution process unless state law specifies a different approach. The No Surprises Act does not set a benchmark reimbursement amount.
In July 2021, HHS, along with the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Office of Personnel Management (collectively, the “Agencies”) issued “Requirements Related to Surprise Billing; Part I” (“Part I”), an interim final rule implementing several provisions of the No Surprises Act. Part I addresses (1) the ban on balance billing for certain out‑of‑network services, (2) the notice and consent process that some providers may use to bill patients for out‑of‑network services, (3) patient cost‑sharing calculations, and (4) a complaint process for any potential violations of the provisions in the law. Part I also clarifies that a health plan that provides emergency coverage must provide that coverage without prior authorization, without regard to whether a facility is in-network or out-of-network, and regardless of other terms of the plan, except for exclusions or coordination of benefits. Health plans also cannot deny claims for emergency coverage based on an after-the-fact assessment of the care provided, any purported delay between when symptoms began and when the patient sought care, or based on how long the symptoms were present.
In September 2021, the Agencies released the interim final rule “Requirements Related to Surprise Billing; Part II” (“Part II”), which addresses (1) the independent dispute resolution process that providers and plans may use to adjudicate any outstanding reimbursement disputes, (2) the good-faith cost estimates providers must share with uninsured or self‑pay patients for scheduled services, (3) a process to resolve any disputes between uninsured/self‑pay patients and providers about the cost estimates, and (4) an external review process as part of the oversight of health plan/issuer compliance with the law and regulations. The Agencies also established a website where an interested party may go to apply to serve as an independent dispute resolution entity and where providers and plans may initiate the process. The provisions in Part I and Part II also went into effect on January 1, 2022.
Many of the provisions of the No Surprises Act impact processes Conifer utilizes to collect accounts receivable, and Conifer has been working with its clients to develop policies and procedures to facilitate compliance. At this time, we are unable to assess the effect that the No Surprises Act or regulations relating to the No Surprises Act might have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
HOSPITAL PRICE TRANSPARENCY RULE
In November 2019, CMS issued a final rule (the “Hospital Price Transparency Rule”) requiring that hospitals share payer-specific negotiated prices for certain health care services with the goal of making it easier for consumers to shop and compare prices across hospitals and estimate the cost of care before going to the hospital. The Hospital Price Transparency Rule, which became effective on January 1, 2021, requires each hospital operating in the United States to provide clear, accessible pricing information online about the items and services it provides in two ways: (1) as a comprehensive machine-readable file with all items and services; and (2) in a display of shoppable services in a consumer-friendly format. These requirements apply to hospitals regardless of Medicare enrollment status. In a final rule issued in November 2021, CMS affirmed its commitment to enforcement and public access to pricing information by modifying the Hospital Price Transparency Rule to increase the civil monetary penalties for noncompliance, setting a minimum penalty of $300 per day for smaller hospitals with a bed count of 30 or fewer and a penalty of $10 per bed per day for hospitals with a bed count greater than 30, not to exceed a maximum daily dollar amount of $5,500. Under this approach, the minimum total annual penalty amount would be $109,500 per hospital, and the maximum total annual penalty amount would be $2,007,500 per hospital. CMS began auditing a sample of hospitals for compliance in January 2022, and it will also investigate complaints. We have developed processes to comply with the requirements of the Hospital Price Transparency Rule, and we believe we are in material compliance with those requirements.
GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS AND QUI TAM LAWSUITS
The healthcare industry is subject to heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts from both federal and state government agencies. The OIG was established as an independent and objective oversight unit of HHS to carry out the mission of preventing fraud and abuse and promoting economy, efficiency and effectiveness of HHS programs and operations. In furtherance of this mission, the OIG, among other things, conducts audits, evaluations and investigations relating to HHS programs and operations and, when appropriate, imposes civil monetary penalties, assessments and administrative sanctions. We have extensive policies and procedures in place to facilitate compliance with the laws, rules and regulations affecting the healthcare industry, however, these policies and procedures cannot ensure compliance in every case.
Healthcare providers are also subject to qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits under the FCA, which allows private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government, alleging that a hospital or healthcare provider has defrauded a government program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government intervenes in the action and prevails, the defendant may be required to pay three times the damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each false claim submitted to the government. As part of the resolution of a qui tam case, the qui tam plaintiff may share in a portion of any settlement or judgment. If the government does not intervene in the action, the qui tam plaintiff may continue to pursue the action independently. There are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. Liability often arises when an entity 
knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA defines the term “knowingly” broadly. Though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity constitutes a “knowing” submission under the FCA and, therefore, will qualify for liability. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 expanded the scope of the FCA by, among other things, creating liability for knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers. It is a violation of the FCA to knowingly fail to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. Qui tam actions can also be filed under certain state false claims laws if the fraud involves Medicaid funds or funding from state and local agencies. We have paid significant amounts to resolve qui tam matters brought against us in the past, and we are unable to predict the impact of future qui tam actions on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
HEALTHCARE FACILITY LICENSING REQUIREMENTS
The operation of healthcare facilities is subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate‑setting, the adequacy of medical care, and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Various licenses and permits also are required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment. Our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation. We believe that all of our healthcare facilities hold all required governmental approvals, licenses and permits material to the operation of their business.
UTILIZATION REVIEW COMPLIANCE AND HOSPITAL GOVERNANCE
The Social Security Act and Medicare regulations generally require that services that may be paid for under the Medicare program or state healthcare programs are (1) provided economically and only when, and to the extent, they are medically reasonable and necessary, (2) of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of healthcare, and (3) supported by appropriate evidence of medical necessity and quality. The Quality Improvement Organization program established under the Social Security Act seeks to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, economy and quality of services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries; to preserve the Medicare Trust Fund by ensuring that Medicare pays only for services that are reasonable and necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting; and to protect Medicare beneficiaries by expeditiously addressing complaints, violations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, and other quality-related issues.
There has been increased scrutiny from outside auditors, government enforcement agencies and others, as well as an increased risk of government investigations and qui tam lawsuits, related to hospitals’ Medicare observation rates and inpatient admission decisions. The term “Medicare observation rate” is defined as total unique observation claims divided by the sum of total unique observation claims and total inpatient short‑stay acute care hospital claims. A low rate may raise suspicions that a hospital is inappropriately admitting patients that could be cared for in an observation setting. In addition, CMS has established a concept referred to as the “two‑midnight rule” to guide practitioners admitting patients and contractors on when it is appropriate to admit individuals as hospital inpatients. Under the two‑midnight rule, a Medicare patient should generally be admitted on an inpatient basis only when there is a reasonable expectation that the patient’s care will cross two midnights; if not, the patient generally should be treated as an outpatient, unless an exception applies. In our affiliated hospitals, we conduct reviews of Medicare inpatient stays of less than two midnights to determine whether a patient qualifies for inpatient admission. Enforcement of the two‑midnight rule has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on inpatient admission rates at our hospitals.
Medical and surgical services and practices are extensively supervised by committees of staff physicians at each of our healthcare facilities, are overseen by each facility’s local governing board, the members of which primarily are community members and physicians, and are reviewed by our clinical quality personnel. The local governing board also helps maintain standards for quality care, develop short‑term and long‑range plans, and establish, review and enforce practices and procedures, as well as approves the credentials, disciplining and, if necessary, the termination of privileges of medical staff members.
CERTIFICATE OF NEED REQUIREMENTS
Some states require state approval for construction, acquisition and closure of healthcare facilities, including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. Certificates or determinations of need, which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities, are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, changes in bed capacity or services, and certain other matters. Our subsidiaries operate acute care hospitals in five states that require a form of state approval under certificate of need programs applicable to those hospitals. Approximately 34% of our licensed hospital beds are located in these states (namely, Alabama, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
South Carolina and Tennessee). The certificate of need programs in most of these states, along with several others, also apply to ASCs.
Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in the inability to expand facilities, add services, acquire a facility or change ownership. Further, violation of such laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of a facility’s license. We are unable to predict whether we will be required or able to obtain any additional certificates of need in any jurisdiction where they are required, or if any jurisdiction will eliminate or alter its certificate of need requirements in a manner that will increase competition and, thereby, affect our competitive position. In those states that do not have certificate of need requirements or that do not require review of healthcare capital expenditure amounts below a relatively high threshold, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our healthcare operations are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations that govern, among other things, our disposal of solid waste, as well as our use, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous and toxic materials (including radiological materials). Our operations also generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with statutes and regulations that vary from state to state. In addition, our operating expenses could be adversely affected if legal and regulatory developments related to climate change or other initiatives result in increased energy or other costs. We could also be affected by climate change and other environmental issues to the extent such issues adversely affect the general economy or result in severe weather affecting the communities in which our facilities are located. At this time, based on current climate conditions and our assessment of existing and pending environmental rules and regulations, as well as treaties and international accords relating to climate change, we do not believe that the costs of complying with environmental laws, including regulations relating to climate change issues, will have a material adverse effect on our future capital expenditures, results of operations or cash flows.

ANTITRUST LAWS
The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit specific types of anti‑competitive conduct, including price fixing, wage fixing, anticompetitive hiring practices, restrictive covenants, concerted refusals to deal, price discrimination and tying arrangements, as well as monopolization and acquisitions of competitors that have, or may have, a substantial adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties.
Antitrust enforcement in the healthcare industry is currently a priority of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). In recent years, the FTC has filed multiple administrative complaints and public comments challenging hospital transactions in several states. The FTC has focused its enforcement efforts on preventing hospital mergers that may, in the government’s view, leave insufficient local options for patient services, which could result in increased costs to consumers. In addition, the FTC has given increased attention to the effect of combinations involving other healthcare providers, including physician practices, as well as to the use of restrictive covenants that limit the ability of employees and others to engage in certain competitive activities. The FTC has also entered into numerous consent decrees in the past several years settling allegations of price‑fixing among providers.
REGULATIONS AFFECTING CONIFER’S OPERATIONS
Conifer and its subsidiaries are subject to civil and criminal statutes and regulations governing consumer finance, medical billing, coding, collections and other operations. In connection with these laws and regulations, Conifer and its subsidiaries have been and expect to continue to be party to various lawsuits, claims, and federal and state regulatory investigations from time to time. Some of these actions may involve large demands, as well as substantial defense costs. We cannot predict the outcome of current or future legal actions against Conifer and its subsidiaries or the effect that judgments, penalties or settlements in such matters may have on Conifer.
BILLING AND COLLECTION ACTIVITIES
The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) regulates persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect, directly or indirectly, consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person. Certain of the accounts receivable handled by Conifer’s third‑party debt collection vendors are subject to the FDCPA, which establishes specific guidelines and procedures that debt collectors must follow in communicating with consumer debtors, including the time, place and manner of such communications. Conifer audits and monitors its vendors for compliance, but there can be no assurance that such audits and monitoring will detect all instances of potential non‑compliance.
Many states also regulate the billing and collection practices of creditors who collect their own debt, as well as the companies a creditor engages to bill and collect from consumers on the creditor’s behalf. These state regulations may be more stringent than the FDCPA. In addition, state regulations may be specific to medical billing and collections or the same or similar to state regulations applicable to third‑party collectors. Certain of the accounts receivable Conifer or its billing, servicing and collections subsidiary, PSS Patient Solution Services, LLC, manages for its clients are subject to these state regulations.
Conifer and its subsidiaries are also subject to both federal and state regulatory agencies who have the authority to investigate consumer complaints relating to a variety of consumer protection laws, including but not limited to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and its state equivalent. These agencies may initiate enforcement actions, including actions to seek restitution and monetary penalties from, or to require changes in business practices of, regulated entities. In addition, affected consumers may bring suits, including class action suits, to seek monetary remedies (including statutory damages) for violations of the federal and state provisions discussed above.
COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS
General—Our ethics and compliance department maintains our values‑based ethics and compliance program, which is designed to (1) help staff in our corporate, USPI and Conifer offices, hospitals, outpatient centers and physician practices meet or exceed applicable standards established by federal and state statutes and regulations, as well as industry practice, (2) monitor and raise awareness of ethical issues among employees and others, and stress the importance of understanding and complying with our Code of Conduct, and (3) provide a channel for employees to make confidential ethics and compliance‑related reports anonymously if they choose. The ethics and compliance department operates independently – it has its own operating budget; it has the authority to hire outside counsel, access any company document and interview any of our personnel; and our chief compliance officer reports directly to the quality, compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors.
Program Charter—Our Quality, Compliance and Ethics Program Charter is the governing document for our ethics and compliance program. Our adherence to the charter is intended to:
•support and maintain our present and future responsibilities with regard to participation in federal healthcare programs; and
•further our goals of operating an organization that (1) fosters and maintains the highest ethical standards among all employees, officers and directors, physicians practicing at our facilities and contractors that furnish healthcare items or services, (2) values compliance with all state and federal statutes and regulations as a foundation of its corporate philosophy, and (3) aligns its behaviors and decisions with Tenet’s core values.
The primary focus of our quality, compliance and ethics program is compliance with the requirements of Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded healthcare programs. Pursuant to the terms of the charter, our ethics and compliance department is responsible for, among other things, the following activities: (1) assessing, critiquing, and (as appropriate) drafting and distributing company policies and procedures; (2) developing, providing, and tracking ethics and compliance training and other training programs, including job‑specific training to those who work in clinical quality, coding, billing, cost reporting and referral source arrangements, in collaboration with the respective department responsible for oversight of each of these areas; (3) creating and disseminating our Code of Conduct and obtaining certifications of adherence to the Code of Conduct as a condition of employment; (4) maintaining and promoting our Ethics Action Line, a 24‑hour, toll‑free hotline that allows for confidential reporting of issues on an anonymous basis and emphasizes our no‑retaliation policy; and (5) responding to and ensuring resolution of all compliance‑related issues that arise from the Ethics Action Line and compliance reports received from facilities and compliance officers (utilizing any compliance reporting software that we may employ for this purpose) or any other source that results in a report to the ethics and compliance department.
Code of Conduct—All of our employees and officers, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and principal accounting officer, are required to abide by our Code of Conduct to advance our mission that our business be conducted in a legal and ethical manner. The members of our board of directors and all of our contractors having functional roles similar to our employees are also required to abide by our Code of Conduct. The standards therein reflect our basic values and form the foundation of a comprehensive process that includes compliance with all corporate policies, procedures and practices. Our Code of Conduct covers such areas as quality patient care, compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations, appropriate use of our assets, protection of patient information and avoidance of conflicts of interest.
As part of the program, we provide compliance training at least annually to every employee and officer, as well as our board of directors and certain physicians and contractors. All such persons are required to report incidents that they believe in good faith may be in violation of the Code of Conduct or our policies, and all are encouraged to contact our Ethics Action Line when they have questions about the standards or any ethics concerns. All reports to the Ethics Action Line are kept confidential to the extent allowed by law, and any individual who makes a report has the option to remain anonymous. Incidents of alleged financial improprieties reported to the Ethics Action Line or the ethics and compliance department are communicated to the audit committee of our board of directors. Reported cases that involve a possible violation of the law or regulatory policies and procedures are referred to the ethics and compliance department for investigation, although certain matters may be referred out to the law or human resources department. Retaliation against anyone in connection with reporting ethical concerns is considered a serious violation of our Code of Conduct, and, if it occurs, it will result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment.
Availability of Documents—The full text of our Quality, Compliance and Ethics Program Charter, our Code of Conduct, and a number of our ethics and compliance policies and procedures are published on our website, at www.tenethealth.com, under the “Our Commitment To Compliance” caption in the “About Us” section. A copy of our Code of Conduct is also available upon written request to our corporate secretary. Information about how to contact our corporate secretary is set forth under “Company Information” below. Amendments to the Code of Conduct and any grant of a waiver from a provision of the Code of Conduct requiring disclosure under applicable SEC rules will be disclosed at the same location as the Code of Conduct on our website.
INSURANCE
The healthcare industry has seen significant increases in the cost of professional and general liability insurance due to increased claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. We maintain captive insurance companies to self‑insure for the majority of our professional and general liability claims, and we purchase insurance from third parties to cover catastrophic claims. All such commercial insurance we purchase is subject to per-claim and policy period aggregate limits. If the policy period aggregate limit of any of these policies is exhausted, in whole or in part, it could deplete or reduce the limits available to pay any other material claims applicable to that policy period. Any losses not covered by or in excess of the amounts maintained under our professional and general liability insurance policies will be funded from our working capital.
In addition to the reserves recorded by our captive insurance subsidiaries, we maintain reserves, including reserves for incurred but not reported claims, for our self‑insured professional liability retentions and claims in excess of the policies’ aggregate limits, based on modeled estimates of losses and related expenses. Also, we provide standby letters of credit to certain of our insurers, which can be drawn upon under certain circumstances, to collateralize the deductible and self‑insured retentions under a selected number of our professional and general liability insurance programs.
We also purchase property, cybersecurity and other insurance coverage from third parties in amounts we believe are adequate and subject to terms of coverage that we believe are reasonable. Our commercial insurance does not cover all claims against us and may not offset the financial impact of a material loss event. Moreover, commercial insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us to maintain at adequate levels. The rise in the number and severity of hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and other weather events, whether or not precipitated by climate change, has created increased risk for insurance companies; it is expected that this increased risk will lead to a rise in insurance premiums and reductions in coverage for property owners in the future. In addition, the risk of ransomware attacks, breaches or other disruptions to information technology systems is elevated in the current environment, which has caused an increase in cyber premiums, lower coverage limits and implementation of cyber-specific policies. For further information regarding our insurance coverage, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
