  Recent Developments
  
  Cessation of Production of AquaBall®, and Management’s Plan
   
 Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, due to the weakness in the sale of the Company’s principal product, AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water, and continued substantial operating losses, the Company’s Board of Directors determined to discontinue the production of AquaBall®, and, as set forth below, terminate the bottling agreement by and between Niagara Bottling LLC, the Company’s contract bottling manufacturer (“Bottler” or “Niagara”), and True Drinks (the “Bottling Agreement”). In addition, the Company has notified Disney Consumer Products, Inc. (“Disney”) of the Company’s desire to terminate its licensing agreement with Disney, pursuant to which the Company was able to feature various Disney characters on each AquaBall® bottle. As a result of management’s decision, and the Company’s failure to pay certain amounts due Disney under the terms of the licensing agreement, the licensing agreement has terminated, and Disney has claimed additional damages of approximately $178,000, net of $378,000 drawn from an irrevocable letter of credit posted in connection with the execution of the license agreement. In addition, Disney has alleged that additional payments are due under the license agreement for minimum royalty amounts required to be paid Disney through the remainder of the original term of the license agreement. While no assurances can be given, management is currently negotiating a discounted settlement of all amounts allegedly owed Disney under the license agreement.
  
 In May 2018, the Company sold its remaining AquaBall® inventory to Red Beard Holdings, LLC (“Red Beard”), the Company’s largest shareholder, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.4 million (the “Purchase Price”), which inventory was commercially non-saleable in the ordinary course. As payment for the Purchase Price, the principal amount of the senior secured convertible promissory note issued to Red Beard by the Company in the principal amount of $2.25 million (the “Red Beard Note”) was reduced by the Purchase Price, resulting in approximately $849,000 owed to Red Beard under the terms of the Red Beard Note as of June 15, 2018.
  
 The Company has reduced its staff to one employee and has taken other steps to minimize general, administrative and other operating costs. Management has also worked to reduce accounts payable by negotiating settlements with creditors utilizing a loan from Red Beard specifically for this purpose. Creditors holding claims totaling approximately $550,000 at December 31, 2017 have agreed to accept payment of approximately $110,000 to settle such claims. Management is currently negotiating with its remaining creditors to settle additional accounts payable.
  
 Management is currently exploring, together with Red Beard, available options to maximize the value of AquaBall® as well as Bazi®, which may include entering into a license or similar agreement with a third party to continue the production, marketing and sale of AquaBall® and Bazi®. In addition, although no assurances can be given, management is exploring, together Red Beard, opportunities to consummate a transaction that would maximize the value of the Company as a fully reporting public operating company. In light of this determination, based on operating results during the year ended December 31, 2017, management’s assessment regarding future operating results, and the substantial personnel and other reductions resulting from the Company’s operating performance, we do not anticipate material revenue subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2018 in the absence of the consummation of a transaction.

 
  Termination of Bottling Agreement and Issuance of Notes
  
 On April 5, 2018 (the “Effective Date”), True Drinks settled all amounts due the Bottler under the terms of the Bottling Agreement (the “Settlement”). As of the Effective Date, the damage amount claimed by the Bottler under the Bottling Agreement was $18,480,620, which amount consisted of amounts due to the Bottler for product as well as amounts due for True Drink’s failure to meet certain minimum requirements under the Bottling Agreement (the “Outstanding Amount”). Concurrently, an affiliate of Red Beard and the Bottler agreed to terminate a personal guaranty of Red Beard’s obligations under the Bottling Agreement in an amount not to exceed $10.0 million (the “Affiliate Guaranty”) (the Bottling Agreement and the Affiliate Guaranty are hereinafter referred to as the “2015 Agreements”).
  
 Under the terms of the Settlement, in exchange for the termination of the 2015 Agreements, the Bottler agreed to accept, among other things: (i) a promissory note in the principal amount of $4,644,906 (the “Principal Amount”), with a 5% per annum interest rate, to be compounded, annually (“Note One”), (ii) a promissory note with a principal amount equal to the Outstanding Amount (“Note Two”), and (iii) a cash payment of $2,185,158 (the “Cash Payment”).
  
 The Principal Amount and all interest payments due under Note One shall be due and payable to the Bottler in full on or before the December 31, 2019 (the “Note Payment”). True Drinks, the Company and Red Beard are each jointly and severally responsible for all amounts due under Note One; provided, however, that in the event of a Change in Control Transaction, as defined in Note One, Red Beard will be the sole obligor for any amounts due under Note One.
  
 Note Two shall have no force or effect except under certain conditions and shall be reduced by any payments made to the Bottler under the terms of the Settlement. True Drinks and the Company shall be jointly and severally responsible for all amounts due, if any, under Note Two, which shall automatically expire and terminate on December 31, 2019.

     In consideration for the guarantee of the Company’s obligations in connection with the Settlement, including as a joint and several obligor under the terms of Note One, the Company is obligated to issue Red Beard 348,367,950 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Shares”), which Shares shall be issued at such time as the Company has amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 300.0 million to at least 2.0 billion (the “Amendment”), but in no event later than September 30, 2018. As a condition to the Company’s obligation to issue the Shares, Red Beard shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, execute a written consent of shareholders to approve the Amendment, and to take such other action as reasonably requested by the Company to effect the Amendment.
  
 In connection with the Settlement, and in order to make the Cash Payment described above, the Company issued the Red Beard Note to Red Beard, which Red Beard Note accrues interest at a rate of 5% per annum. In May 2018, as a result of the sale to Red Beard of the Company’s remaining AquaBall® inventory, the principal amount of the Red Beard Note was reduced by the Purchase Price.
  
 Pursuant to the terms of the Red Beard Note, Red Beard shall have the right, at its sole option, to convert the outstanding balance due into that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company’s Common Stock equal to the outstanding balance divided by $0.005 (the “Conversion Option”); provided, however, that the Company shall have the right, at its sole option, to pay all or a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest due and payable to Red Beard upon its exercise of the Conversion Option in cash. Such Conversion Option shall not be exercisable unless and until such time as the Company has filed the Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State.
  
 All outstanding principal and interest due under the terms of the Red Beard Note shall be due and payable to Red Beard in full on or before December 31, 2019, and is secured by a continuing security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets.
  
  This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a discussion of the business of the Company at December 31, 2017, prior to management’s determination, as set forth above.

 
  Our Products
  
 As of December 31, 2017, we marketed and distributed products that offer a healthful, natural alternative to high sugar, high calorie and nutritionally deficient beverages. Our mission was to bring integrity back to the beverage industry and that honesty applied to every drop in every bottle. Our goal was to create and deliver beverages for families that encourage improved health, while being clear about what our products contain (and what they do not).
 AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water
  
 Our flagship product was AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water, a zero-sugar, zero-calorie, preservative-free, vitamin-enhanced, naturally flavored water drink. AquaBall® does not contain high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, or artificial colors. Unlike high sugar and high calorie beverages marketed toward children, AquaBall® is sweetened with stevia, an all-natural sweetener, allowing AquaBall® to provide a zero-sugar, zero-calorie alternative to juice and soda for kids. The main component of the marketing vision behind the AquaBall® brand was our licensing agreements with Disney, allowing each AquaBall® bottle to prominently feature various Disney characters.
  
 AquaBall® was packaged in 10-ounce bottles, and was wrapped with colorful, eye-catching labels featuring popular movie and television characters. AquaBall® came in fruit punch, grape, strawberry lemonade and berry frost flavors and was sold primarily in grocery and convenience stores throughout the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2017, AquaBall® sales accounted for approximately 94% of the Company’s total revenue.
  
  Bazi®
  
  Bazi® All Natural Energy, is a liquid nutritional drink packed with eight different super fruits, including the Chinese jujube and seven other super fruits, plus 12 vitamins. The proprietary formula contains the following fruits: jujube fruit, blueberry, pomegranate, goji berry, chokeberry, raspberry, acai and sea buckthorn. Additionally, Bazi® contains 12 vitamins, including vitamins A, C, E and B-complex. In August 2011, BioEnergy Ribose was added to Bazi®, enhancing the product’s energy delivery system. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Bazi® sales accounted for approximately 6% of the Company’s total revenue. Due to the ceased production of AquaBall® in early 2018, the Company currently anticipates that Bazi® sales will account for substantially all of the Company’s revenue in the near future.

  Manufacturing and Distribution
  
  Manufacturing
  
 Beginning in May 2016, all production of AquaBall® moved to Niagara, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Bottling Agreement. Niagara handled all aspects of production, including the procurement of all raw materials necessary to produce AquaBall®. In accordance with the terms of the Bottling Agreement, Niagara provided us with finished goods and billed us for product as it is shipped to customers. In addition to Niagara, we worked with a limited number of partners to repack bottles of AquaBall® into six-packs and our 15-pack club packages. As disclosed under the heading “Recent Developments” above, on April 5, 2018, we entered into the Settlement with Niagara, pursuant to which the Bottling Agreement was terminated. The decision to terminate the Bottling Agreement reflected management’s determination that we could not produce AquaBall® profitably under the Bottling Agreement.
  
  Bazi® has been, and continues to be, manufactured by Arizona Packaging and Production since 2007.
  
  Retail Distribution
  
  After experiencing an increase in same store sales in those locations serviced by regional distributors, we began shifting our retail distribution strategy towards a nationwide network of regional distributors for each of our grocery, drug and convenience accounts in November 2015. Throughout 2016 and 2017, we signed with distributor partners in 47 states. We also greatly increased our sales organization to manage the distributor network. Upon implementing this plan, we experienced the expected sales increase in singles, but we found that our resulting pricing on multi-packs was too high and, thus, their sales lagged in many regions of the country. At the same time, our discounts and allowances increased considerably as did our labor costs. These conditions contributed to our decision to discontinue production of AquaBall® in early 2018.
 Online Sales
  
 Our e-commerce platform allowed consumers to purchase AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water through Amazon.com, and still allows current and future consumers to purchase Bazi® Energy Shot through http://www.drinkbazi.com. Prior to discontinuing the production of AquaBall®, we drove traffic to relevant landing pages and micro sites through digital marketing campaigns and promotions, as well as a variety of social media marketing efforts.
 Sales and Marketing
   
 Our sales and marketing efforts were directed from our corporate offices in Irvine, California, utilizing our own staff, as well as outside resources retained to build market awareness and shelf placement of our products. The Company managed key national accounts through our in-house national sales team. Our sales teams worked to secure national distribution with these customers through multiple avenues, including joint sales meetings with Disney sales personnel.
  
 As noted above, in November 2015, we began building a nationwide network of direct store distributors to handle the distribution of AquaBall® in the grocery, drug and convenience channels. In 2017, with the exception of accounts requiring direct to warehouse delivery, accounts were serviced by our distribution network. Our sales team continued to secure distribution with both national and regional accounts, while our distributor partners added to our distribution with independent grocery and convenience stores in their respective territories.
  
  Due to pricing issues caused by the distributor mark-up, our multi-pack sales did not meet expectations. In addition, most distributors failed to meet sales volumes necessary to make the relationships profitable. This contributed to the Company’s determination to discontinue the production of AquaBall® and significantly reduce our personnel in early 2018.

  Source and Availability of Raw Materials
  
 Beginning in May 2016 and until the cessation of production of AquaBall® in early 2018, Niagara handled all aspects of production of AquaBall®, including the procurement of all raw materials. Prior to May 2016, we utilized a variety of suppliers to purchase raw materials for AquaBall®.
  
 During 2017, we relied significantly on one supplier for 100% of our purchases of certain raw materials for Bazi®. Bazi, Inc. has sourced these raw materials from this supplier since 2007, and does not anticipate any issues with the supply of these raw materials.
  
 We own the formulas for both AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water and Bazi® All Natural Energy, and we believe that our purchasing requirements can be readily met from alternative sources, if necessary.
  
  Competition
  
 The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water competed most directly with other beverages marketed directly to children. We also competed with other manufacturers of functional beverages, and with manufacturers of more traditional beverages, such as juice and soda.
  
 Our primary competition for AquaBall® was in the estimated $2.0 billion market for products marketed directly to children, including CapriSun®, Honest Kids, Good to Grow, Tummy Ticklers, Kool-aid and others. General competition in the beverage industry includes products owned by multinational corporations with significant financial resources, including Vitamin Water, owned by Coca-Cola, and Sobe and Propel, both owned by Pepsi Co. Bazi® competitors include Steaz®, Guayaki Yerba Mate, POM Wonderful®, as well as sports and energy drinks including Gatorade®, Red Bull®, 5-Hour Energy®, RockStar®, Monster®, Powerade®, Accelerade® and All Sport®. Indirect competition for AquaBall® and Bazi® includes soft drinks and juice products, such as Sunny Delight® and other fruit drinks. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. They, therefore, have the advantage of established reputations, brand names, track records, back office and managerial support systems and other advantages that we cannot duplicate in the near future, if ever. Moreover, many competitors, by virtue of their longevity and capital resources, have established lines of distribution to which we do not have access, and are not likely to duplicate in the near term, if ever.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
  We have relied on the AquaBall® patent, AquaBall® and Bazi® trademarks and licensing agreements to market our products and make them stand out among our competitors.
 Patents and Trademarks
  
  We were granted the patent for AquaBall®’s stackable, spherical drink container in 2009, via GT Beverage Company, LLC, who we purchased on March 31, 2012. In both 2016 and 2017, we stopped using this bottle and, instead, switched to a bottle specifically designed for us by Niagara. In 2016, we took an impairment charge on the value of the spherical drink container patent.
  
 We maintain trademark protection for AquaBall® and have federal trademark registration for Bazi®. This trademark registration is protected for a period of ten years and then is renewable thereafter if still in use.
  
  Licensing Agreements
  
 We first entered into licensing agreements with Disney and an 18-month licensing agreement with Marvel Characters, B.V. (“Marvel”) (collectively, the “Licensing Agreements”) in 2012. Each Licensing Agreement allowed us to feature popular Disney and Marvel characters on AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water, allowing AquaBall® to stand out among other beverages marketed towards children. Under the terms and conditions of the Licensing Agreements, we worked with the Disney and Marvel teams to create colorful, eye-catching labels that surrounded the entire spherical shape of each AquaBall®. Once the label designs were approved, we worked with Disney and Marvel to set retail calendars, rotating the placement of different AquaBall® designs over the course of the year.

 In March 2017, the Company and Disney entered into a renewed Licensing Agreement, which extended the Company’s license with Disney through March 31, 2019. The terms of the Disney Licensing Agreement entitle Disney to receive a royalty rate of 5% on sales of AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water adorned with Disney characters, paid quarterly, with a total guarantee of $807,000 over the period from April 1, 2017 through March 31, 2019. In addition, the Company is required to make a ‘common marketing fund’ contribution equal to 1% of sales due annually during the Licensing Agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company paid a total of $464,070 and $129,597, respectively, to Disney pursuant to the Licensing Agreement, and $130,000 was accrued and was due and payable to Disney under the License Agreement at December 31, 2017. As discussed above, in connection with the Company’s discontinued production of AquaBall®, the Company notified Disney of the Company’s desire to terminate the Licensing Agreement in early 2018.  As a result of management’s decision, and the Company’s failure to pay certain amounts due Disney under the terms of the Licensing Agreement, the Licensing Agreement has terminated, and Disney has claimed additional damages of approximately $178,000, net of $378,000 drawn from an irrevocable letter of credit posted in connection with the execution of the License Agreement. In addition, Disney has alleged that additional payments are due under the License Agreement for minimum royalty amounts required to be paid Disney through the remainder of the original term of the license agreement. While no assurances can be given, management is currently negotiating a discounted settlement of all amounts allegedly owed Disney under the license agreement.
  
 On August 22, 2015, the Company and Marvel entered into a renewed Licensing Agreement to extend the Company’s license to feature certain Marvel characters on bottles of AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water through December 31, 2017. The Marvel Agreement required the Company to pay to Marvel a 5% royalty rate on sales of AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water adorned with Marvel characters, paid quarterly, through December 31, 2017, with a total guarantee of $200,000 over the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The Company decided not to renew the Marvel Agreement for another term. Thus, the Licensing Agreement expired by its terms on December 31, 2017. The total royalty paid to Marvel during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $118,402.
  
  Government Regulations
  
 The production, distribution and sale in the United States of our products are subject to various U.S. federal and state regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, including as amended by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; and a number of other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, marketing, labeling and ingredients of such products.
  
 Certain states and localities prohibit the sale of certain beverages unless a deposit or tax is charged for containers. These requirements vary by each jurisdiction. Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress. We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
  
 All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position, compliance with or violation of any current or future regulations and legislation could require material expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
  
  We believe that current and reasonably foreseeable governmental regulation will have minimal impact on our business.
  
  Research and Development
  
 No expenses were recorded on research and development for the year ended December 31, 2017. Upon execution of the Bottling Agreement in October 2015, we completed the development of an improved “clean label” formulation of AquaBall®, which remained sugar and calorie free but eliminated all preservatives, and was produced using a hot-fill process. We completed the transition of AquaBall® to the new, preservative-free formulation and begin distribution from Niagara facilities in June 2016.
  
  Bazi® was developed during 2006, and was launched in January 2007. This product did not require FDA or other regulatory approval. During 2009, new ingredients and productions methods were researched to integrate into existing products or new products. Since 2012, Bazi® has been sold solely online in 12, 24, 36, 48 and 144 packs.
  
  Employees
  
 We had ten full-time employees and one part-time employee as of December 31, 2017, and currently have one employee.
  
  Compliance with Environmental Laws
  
 In California, we are required to collect redemption values from our retail customers and to remit such redemption values to the State of California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold. In certain other states where our products are sold, we are also required to collect deposits from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective jurisdictions based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states.
