Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing novel medicines with the potential to transform the lives of people with debilitating disorders of the brain. Our first product, ZULRESSO® (brexanolone) CIV injection, is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of postpartum depression, or PPD, in adults. We have a portfolio of other product candidates with a current focus on modulating two critical central nervous system, or CNS, receptor systems, GABA and NMDA. The GABA receptor family, which is recognized as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, mediates downstream neurologic and bodily function via activation of GABAA receptors. The NMDA-type receptors of the glutamate receptor system are a major excitatory receptor system in the CNS. Dysfunction in these systems is implicated in a broad range of CNS disorders. We are currently targeting diseases and disorders of the brain with three key focus areas: depression, neurology and neuropsychiatry.
 Our first product, ZULRESSO, is a proprietary intravenous, or IV, formulation of brexanolone, approved in the U.S. as a treatment for PPD in adults. Brexanolone is chemically identical to allopregnanolone, a naturally occurring neuroactive steroid that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. We launched ZULRESSO commercially in the U.S. for the treatment of PPD in June 2019. Currently, ZULRESSO may only be administered in qualified, medically-supervised healthcare settings. We have initiated an open-label clinical trial designed to assess the potential for safe-use administration of ZULRESSO in a patient’s home for the treatment of PPD, known as the SUNBIRD Study, which is anticipated to be completed in late 2022.
 Our next most advanced product candidate is zuranolone (SAGE-217), a novel oral compound being developed for certain affective disorders, including major depressive disorder, or MDD, and PPD. Zuranolone is a neuroactive steroid that, like brexanolone, is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, targeting both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. We plan to submit a new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the second half of 2022 seeking approval of zuranolone for the treatment of MDD. An associated NDA filing seeking approval of zuranolone for PPD is anticipated in the first half of 2023, pending the completion and results of the ongoing SKYLARK Study in PPD. The FDA granted Fast Track designation to zuranolone in PPD in early 2022, and previously granted zuranolone Breakthrough Therapy designation and Fast Track designation to zuranolone for the treatment of MDD.
 To date, we have completed five pivotal clinical trials of zuranolone, four in MDD and one in PPD. The completed pivotal trial evaluating zuranolone for the treatment of PPD and three of the four completed pivotal trials evaluating zuranolone for the treatment of MDD met their primary endpoints. We announced results from the following pivotal clinical trials of zuranolone in either 2021 or early 2022:
  
• | CORAL Study (completed)
--+------------------------

 
On February 16, 2022, we announced results from the CORAL Study, a placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating a two-week course of zuranolone 50 mg, when co-initiated with a newly administered open-label standard antidepressant therapy, or ADT, compared with open-label standard of care ADT co-initiated with placebo, as an acute rapid response treatment in patients with MDD. Patients in the clinical trial received zuranolone 50 mg co-initiated with an open-label standard of care ADT or open-label standard of care ADT co-initiated with placebo once nightly for 14 days followed by continuation of the ADT for an additional short-term follow-up period. In the CORAL Study, zuranolone 50 mg co-initiated with an ADT met the primary endpoint of statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms at Day 3 and met the key secondary endpoint of a 
 6

statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms over the two-week treatment period, in each case as compared to ADT co-initiated with placebo.
 
 
• | WATERFALL Study (completed)
--+----------------------------

 
In June 2021, we announced that the WATERFALL Study, a pivotal, Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of zuranolone 50 mg in adults aged 18 to 64 years with MDD, met its primary endpoint. 
 
 
• | SHORELINE Study (ongoing)
--+--------------------------

 
In 2021, we reported positive topline 12-month data from both the 30 mg cohort and the 50 mg cohort of the SHORELINE Study, an open-label Phase 3 clinical trial of zuranolone in MDD, which is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and need for repeat dosing of zuranolone in adults for up to one year. Enrollment in the 50 mg cohort of the study is ongoing. 
 The SKYLARK Study, a Phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating a two-week course of zuranolone 50 mg in women with PPD, with additional short-term follow-up, is ongoing, and we expect to report topline results in mid-2022.
 We are jointly developing zuranolone and another of our late-stage compounds, SAGE-324, in the U.S. with Biogen MA Inc., or BIMA, and Biogen International GmbH, or, together with BIMA, Biogen, under a collaboration and license agreement, or the Biogen Collaboration Agreement, that became effective in December 2020. 
 
Under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement, we will also jointly commercialize products containing zuranolone, which we refer to as Licensed 217 Products, and products containing SAGE-324, which we refer to as Licensed 324 Products, with Biogen in the U.S. if our development efforts are successful. We refer to the Licensed 217 Products and Licensed 324 Products individually as a Product Class and collectively as the Licensed Products. In addition, we have granted Biogen sole rights to develop and commercialize the Licensed Products outside the U.S., other than in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, or the Shionogi Territory, with respect to zuranolone, where we have granted rights to Shionogi & Co., Ltd., or Shionogi. We refer to the territories outside the U.S. to which Biogen has rights under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement with respect to the applicable Licensed Product as the Biogen Territory. We also have a collaboration agreement with Shionogi for the development of zuranolone in the Shionogi Territory. Shionogi recently reported completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of zuranolone for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe MDD in Japan, which Shionogi reported achieved its primary endpoints.
 In addition to zuranolone, we have a portfolio of other novel compounds that target GABAA receptors, including SAGE-324. SAGE-324 is a novel GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator intended for chronic oral dosing. In April 2021, we announced that our placebo-controlled Phase 2 KINETIC Study evaluating SAGE-324 for the treatment of adults with essential tremor achieved its primary endpoint. We initiated a Phase 2b placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical trial of SAGE-324 in patients with essential tremor in late 2021, known as the KINETIC 2 Study. Additional development plans for SAGE-324 will be determined as part of our strategic collaboration with Biogen. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety of SAGE-324 in patients with essential tremor in mid-2022. We believe SAGE-324 also has potential for the treatment of a number of other neurological conditions, including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.
 
Our second area of focus for development is novel compounds that target the NMDA receptor. Our lead product candidate selected in this area is SAGE-718, an oxysterol-based positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, which we are exploring in certain cognition-related disorders associated with NMDA receptor dysfunction, including cognition dysfunction associated with diseases such as Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. 
 
SAGE-718 is currently being studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-718 in patients with Huntington’s disease cognitive impairment, known as the DIMENSION Study, which is designed to evaluate the efficacy of once-daily dosed SAGE-718 over three months. Dosing in the DIMENSION Study commenced in 
 7

early 2022. We plan to initiate, in mid-2022, a second placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-718 in patients with Huntington’s disease cognitive impairment, with a healthy volunteer component, known as the SURVEYOR Study, with the goal of generating evidence linking efficacy signals on cognitive performance to domains of real-world functioning. We also plan to initiate a Phase 3 open-label study of SAGE-718 in patients with Huntington’s disease cognitive impairment in late 2022. The FDA has granted SAGE-718 Fast Track designation as a potential treatment for patients with Huntington’s disease.
 
We also achieved development milestones in 2021 evaluating SAGE-718 for the treatment of cognitive issues associated with Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. In May 2021, we announced results from the first part of a Phase 2a open-label study of SAGE-718 evaluating patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Parkinson’s disease, known as the PARADIGM Study. Data from the PARADIGM Study showed that SAGE-718 had a positive impact on multiple domains of cognition, including executive function and learning and memory, while leaving domains altering simple attention or reaction time unaffected. A four-week dosing cohort in the PARADIGM Study is ongoing to gather additional data in the Parkinson’s disease patient population. We plan to initiate a placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-718 in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Parkinson’s disease in mid-2022. In December 2021, we reported topline data from a Phase 2a open-label clinical trial of SAGE-718 in patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, known as the LUMINARY Study. Data from the LUMINARY Study showed treatment with SAGE-718 resulted in consistent improvement across multiple tests of executive performance, as well as improvement on key tests of learning and memory. In addition, SAGE-718 has been well-tolerated in studies to date. We also plan to initiate a randomized placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-718 in patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease in late 2022.
 We have other programs at earlier stages of development with a focus on both acute and chronic brain health disorders. We expect to continue our work on allosteric modulation of the GABAA and NMDA receptor systems in the brain. The GABAA and NMDA receptor systems are broadly accepted as impacting many psychiatric and neurological disorders, spanning disorders of mood, seizure, cognition, anxiety, sleep, pain, and movement, among others. We believe that we may have the opportunity to develop molecules from our internal portfolio with the goal of addressing a number of these disorders in the future. We also believe that we may have the opportunity to use our scientific approach to explore targets beyond the GABAA and NMDA receptor systems and to develop compounds in areas of unmet need outside of brain health.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to build a top-tier biopharmaceutical company that is the leader in developing and commercializing brain health therapies. Our current focus is on building on our multi-franchise opportunities in depression, neurology, and neuropsychiatry. Key elements of our strategy are to:

Understanding the Foundations of Our Approach
 The CNS is composed of a vast and complex network of different structures and cell types, most of which serve, directly or indirectly, to provide a means for the nervous system to signal or communicate with other nerve cells to regulate brain function. The cell type responsible for this signaling is called a neuron. One way chemical or electrical signals exert their effects on neurons is by traveling across a physical gap located between two neurons, called a synapse. Presynaptic neurons transmit signals whereas postsynaptic neurons react to the signals. The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each having hundreds to tens of thousands of synapses to allow for this communication. This process is essential to all things, from organ function, to movement, to memory and all behavioral processes. Neurotransmission is the process by which signaling molecules, called neurotransmitters, are released by a presynaptic neuron, travel over the synaptic space and bind to and interact with receptors on a postsynaptic neuron. Depending on the nature of the neurotransmitter and receptor, this interaction results in excitation, inhibition or modulation of the receiving neuron’s behavior.
 We are currently focused on developing drugs based on selective allosteric modulation of neurotransmitter receptors in the CNS. Allosteric modulators are a class of small molecules that interact at a site different from the site where neurotransmitters bind, and allow the potential for fine-tuning of neuronal signals. We believe that nowhere in the body is it more important to maintain normal rhythms than in the brain, and accordingly we believe that allosteric modulation approaches are well-suited for the treatment of diseases and disorders of the brain.
 We utilize our proprietary chemistry capabilities to design and identify drugs that are allosteric modulators, and that have properties targeted to the indications of interest. Our goal is to select for development compounds that we believe are capable of varying degrees of desired activity rather than complete activation or inhibition of the receptor. Our focus as a company is on brain health, and we are currently targeting two critical CNS receptor systems: GABA and NMDA. The GABA receptor family, which is recognized as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, mediates downstream neurologic and bodily function in part via activation of GABAA receptors. GABAA receptors play a key role in regulating neuron excitability. The NMDA-type receptors of the glutamate receptor system are a major excitatory receptor system in the CNS. NMDA receptors serve a critical role in CNS-related activities. Dysfunction in these systems is implicated in a broad range of brain disorders. 
 Our proprietary chemistry platform is centered, as a starting point, on our knowledge of the chemical scaffolds of endogenous neuroactive steroids that are allosteric modulators of GABAA or NMDA receptors. We have leveraged this platform to assemble a chemistry portfolio of greater than 8,000 compounds. We believe our proprietary chemistry platform allows us to:
  
• | control important properties such as half-life, brain penetration and the types of receptors our drugs act upon, thereby modulating either inhibition or excitation either acutely or chronically; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | create drugs that are designed to exert control over the intensity of receptor activation or deactivation, with the potential to hit targets in the brain with more precision, with the goal of increased tolerability and fewer off-target side effects than current CNS therapies or previous therapies that have failed in development.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We target diseases and disorders of the brain where we believe patient populations are easily identified, clinical endpoints are well-defined, and development pathways are feasible.

Our Product Pipeline
 The following table summarizes the status of our product and product candidate portfolio as of the filing date of this Annual Report.

ZULRESSO® (Brexanolone) CIV Injection
 
Our first product, ZULRESSO, is a proprietary IV formulation of brexanolone. Brexanolone is chemically identical to allopregnanolone, a naturally occurring neuroactive steroid that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. We launched ZULRESSO commercially in the U.S. in June 2019 for the treatment of PPD in adults, after approval by the FDA and completion of controlled substance scheduling of brexanolone by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and incorporation of the scheduling into the FDA-approved label and other product information. The DEA placed ZULRESSO into Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. ZULRESSO is administered as a continuous infusion given over two and a half days. Because of the risk of serious harm resulting from excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness during the ZULRESSO infusion, ZULRESSO must be administered in a medically-supervised healthcare setting that has been certified under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program and meets the other requirements of the REMS program, including requirements related to monitoring of the patient during the infusion. Patients who are prescribed ZULRESSO are required to enroll in a registry which may allow us to compile additional information to further our understanding of the risk of excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness during administration of ZULRESSO and management of the risk. Given the mode and setting of administration of ZULRESSO and the requirements of the REMS program, ZULRESSO has been administered to date primarily to treat women with severe PPD, and we expect that to continue to be the case. We estimate that about 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with PPD fall into this category. We have initiated an open-label clinical trial designed to assess the potential for safe-use administration of ZULRESSO in a patient’s home for the treatment of PPD, known as the SUNBIRD Study, which is anticipated to be completed in late 2022.
 PPD is one of the most common medical complications during and after pregnancy, and is characterized by depressive symptoms that may occur during pregnancy or following childbirth up to 12 months. PPD symptoms may include sadness and depressed mood; anxiety or agitation; loss of interest in daily activities; changes in eating and sleeping habits; feeling overwhelmed; fatigue and decreased energy; inability to concentrate; hypervigilance about the baby or lack of interest in the baby; and feelings of worthlessness, shame or guilt. In the U.S., estimates of mothers experiencing symptoms of PPD each year vary state-to-state from 9.7% to 23.5%, with an overall average of 13.2%. Based on these data, we estimate that 500,000 or more women in the U.S. each year may experience symptoms of PPD, and approximately 50% are formally diagnosed. We estimate that 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with PPD will 
 11

experience severe symptoms. PPD can lead to devastating consequences for a woman and for her family. Suicide is one of the leading causes of maternal death following childbirth. 
 ZULRESSO is the only pharmacological therapy specifically approved for PPD. The current standard of care for PPD is comprised of psychotherapy and, in women with moderate or severe PPD, the cautious use of pharmacological therapies such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs.
 Naturally occurring allopregnanolone is found at its highest levels in women during the third trimester of pregnancy, returning to normal levels generally within 24 hours after giving birth. Levels of allopregnanolone have been found to be lower in women with PPD than in healthy women. It may be that women with PPD are particularly sensitive to the rapid decline in allopregnanolone after birth, potentially causing GABAA-system mediated mood disruption. These data led to our interest in evaluating allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor—such as brexanolone and zuranolone—for the treatment of PPD. 
 The approval of ZULRESSO in the U.S. was based on positive results from our HUMMINGBIRD Phase 3 clinical program, which was comprised of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of brexanolone in women with PPD, with supportive evidence from a Phase 2 clinical trial of brexanolone in PPD. Results from the HUMMINGBIRD Phase 3 clinical program were published in the September 22, 2018 issue of The Lancet. 
 Zuranolone (SAGE-217)
 Our next most advanced product candidate is zuranolone (SAGE-217), a novel oral compound being developed for the treatment of MDD and PPD. We plan to submit an NDA to the FDA in the second half of 2022 seeking approval of zuranolone in MDD. An associated NDA filing seeking approval of zuranolone for PPD is anticipated in the first half of 2023, pending the completion and results from the ongoing SKYLARK Study, a Phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating a two-week course of zuranolone 50 mg in women with PPD, with additional short-term follow-up. Zuranolone is a neuroactive steroid that, like brexanolone, is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, targeting both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. We also believe zuranolone has potential in other indications such as treatment resistant depression, bipolar depression and generalized anxiety disorder. We are jointly developing zuranolone in the U.S. with Biogen under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement that became effective in December 2020, and will jointly commercialize zuranolone in the U.S. if our development efforts are successful and zuranolone is approved in the U.S. The Biogen Collaboration Agreement covers any products incorporating zuranolone. We have granted Biogen sole rights to develop and commercialize the Licensed 217 Products outside the U.S., other than in the Shionogi Territory, where we have granted rights to Shionogi. The FDA granted Fast Track designation to zuranolone in PPD in early 2022, and previously granted zuranolone Breakthrough Therapy designation and Fast Track designation to zuranolone for the treatment of MDD.
 MDD is a serious mental health disorder commonly characterized by symptoms of depressed mood and/or loss of interest in pleasurable activities causing impairment in daily life. MDD is characterized by a period of depressive symptoms lasting at least two weeks and is associated with changes in affect, cognition, and function. In typical depressive episodes, the person experiences depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and reduced energy leading to diminished activity for at least two weeks. Many people with MDD also suffer from anxiety symptoms and medically unexplained somatic symptoms. A person with moderate or severe MDD will typically have difficulties carrying out his or her usual work, school, domestic or social activities due to symptoms of depression. Antidepressants are widely used for the treatment of MDD, but many patients do not adequately respond to existing treatments. According to estimates, more than 19 million adults in the U.S. reported at least one major depressive episode in 2019. Among U.S. adults reporting at least one major depressive episode in 2019, approximately 12.8 million (66.3%) received treatment within the prior year; and 9.7 million received pharmacologic treatment. Research conducted between April 2020 and April 2021 reported a three- to four-fold increase in symptoms of depression among adults in the U.S. compared to prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest the role of GABAA receptor dysfunction in depression. Low GABA and allopregnanolone levels have been found in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of depressed patients.
 12

To date, we have completed five pivotal clinical trials evaluating zuranolone, four in MDD and one in PPD, the results of which have been previously disclosed. The completed pivotal trial evaluating zuranolone for the treatment of PPD and three of the four completed pivotal trials evaluating zuranolone for the treatment of MDD met their primary endpoints. We announced results from the following pivotal clinical trials of zuranolone in either 2021 or early 2022:
  
• | CORAL Study (completed)
--+------------------------

 
On February 16, 2022, we announced results from the CORAL Study, a placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating a two-week course of zuranolone 50 mg, when co-initiated with a newly administered open-label ADT, compared with open-label standard of care ADT co-initiated with placebo, as an acute rapid response treatment in patients with MDD. Patients in the clinical trial received zuranolone 50 mg co-initiated with an open-label standard of care ADT or open-label standard of care ADT co-initiated with placebo once nightly for 14 days followed by continuation of the ADT for an additional short-term follow-up period. The study results showed a mean change from baseline in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, or HAMD-17, total score of -8.9 ± 0.39 (n=210) at Day 3 for patients in the zuranolone co-initiated with ADT arm compared with -7.0 ± 0.38 (n=215) mean change from baseline for patients in the ADT co-initiated with placebo arm. The key secondary endpoint measured the treatment effect over the two-week treatment period at all scheduled visits (measured using equal weighted means for Days 3, 8, 12 and 15 of the study). The mean change over the treatment period for patients who received zuranolone co-initiated with an ADT was -11.7 ±0.40 (n=210) compared with -10.1 ±0.39 (n=215) for patients who received ADT co-initiated with placebo. Other secondary endpoints demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in HAMD-17 score in the zuranolone co-initiated with ADT arm compared to the ADT arm at Days 8 and 12, while Day 15 demonstrated numerical superiority and Day 42 showed equivalence. The results also indicate that zuranolone 50 mg co-initiated with a standard of care ADT was generally well-tolerated with no new safety signals identified. The majority of patients in the study experienced treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, that were mild or moderate in severity, consistent with previous data. The adverse events occurring 10% or higher in either treatment arm (zuranolone with ADT vs. ADT with placebo) were somnolence (18.4% vs. 8.3%), dizziness (13.2% vs. 7.3%), headache (11.8% vs. 14.7%), and nausea (9.0% vs 23.4%). The percentage of patients reporting TEAEs leading to drug discontinuation was 6.6% in the zuranolone co-initiated with an ADT arm, and 3.7% in the ADT co-initiated with placebo arm, respectively. The percentage of patients reporting TEAEs leading to discontinuation of ADT were 7.5% in the zuranolone co-initiated with an ADT arm, and 5.5% in the ADT co-initiated with placebo arm, respectively. 
 
 
• | WATERFALL Study (completed)
--+----------------------------

 
In June 2021, we announced that the WATERFALL Study, a pivotal, Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of zuranolone 50 mg in adults aged 18 to 64 years with MDD, met its primary endpoint. In the WATERFALL Study, zuranolone 50 mg showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in depressive symptoms as measured by HAMD-17 total score at Day 15 (p-value=0.0141) compared to placebo. Patients in the zuranolone arm with a decrease in HAMD-17 baseline score of ≥50% at Day 15 retained on average 86% of their HAMD-17 improvement at Day 42 (four weeks after dosing ended). A rapid onset of treatment effect was seen in the HAMD-17 results at Days 3, 8 and 12. Zuranolone was generally well-tolerated in the WATERFALL Study and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous clinical studies. The rate of TEAEs reported in the zuranolone group was 60.1% (161/268) compared to the placebo group at 44.6% (120/269). The majority of the TEAEs reported were mild to moderate. The most common TEAEs that were reported by ≥ 5% of patients treated with zuranolone (rates compared to placebo) included somnolence 15.3% (3.0%), dizziness 13.8% (2.2%), headache 10.8% (7.8%), and sedation 7.5% (0.4%). These events predominantly occurred during the 14-day treatment period. Throughout the study, a total of four patients reported serious adverse events, two (0.7%) each in the zuranolone and placebo groups; no deaths occurred in the study. The percent of patients reporting TEAEs leading to drug discontinuation was 3.4% (9/268) and 1.5% (4/269), in the zuranolone and placebo groups, respectively.
 
 
• | SHORELINE Study (ongoing)
--+--------------------------

 13



We are also conducting an open-label Phase 3 clinical trial, known as the SHORELINE Study, evaluating the safety, tolerability, and need for repeat dosing with zuranolone in adults with MDD, in which patients receive an initial two-week course of zuranolone and those who have a clinical response (decrease in HAMD-17 baseline score of ≥50%) from the first cycle have the opportunity to be followed for up to one year and are eligible to receive as-needed retreatment during the follow-up period. The need for repeated dosing is assessed every 14 days based on the results of a patient-reported Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (≥10) and HAMD-17 assessment (≥20). The protocol of the clinical trial requires a minimum of 56 days between zuranolone 14-day courses, to allow for a maximum of five treatments during the follow-up period. 
 
In December 2021, we reported 12-month data from the 50 mg cohort of the SHORELINE Study. Data reported for this cohort of patients (n=199), showed that a majority of the patients who had a clinical response to the initial 14-day course received only one two-week course of treatment in total during their time in the study and nearly 80% received only one or two treatment courses in total. Specifically, of the 146 patients who had a clinical response to the initial 2-week treatment, 80 (54.8%) patients received only the single initial zuranolone course during their time in the study, while 36 (24.7%) received a total of two course, 15 (10.3%) received a total of three courses, 10 (6.8%) received a total of four courses and 5 (3.4%) received a total of five courses in total. Zuranolone 50 mg was generally well-tolerated with no new safety finding or trend identified in the long-term safety data available to date on patients followed up to one year who received a single or repeat dosing courses. Safety was assessed during treatment and in between treatment courses and over multiple treatment courses to help inform tolerability over time. Over the entire study, 137 of 199 (68.8%) patients who initiated treatment with zuranolone 50 mg reported at least one TEAE, similar to the previously reported 30 mg cohort. The most common TEAEs that were reported by ≥ 5% of patients treated with zuranolone were somnolence (32; 16.1%), dizziness (30; 15.1%), headache (25; 12.7%), sedation (20; 10.1%), insomnia (14; 7.0%), nausea (13; 6.5%), and tremor (11; 5.5%). The majority of patients reported TEAEs with a maximum severity of mild to moderate.
 
The data from the 50 mg cohort is consistent with 12-month data we reported in March 2021, from the completed 30 mg cohort of the SHORELINE Study. In the 30 mg zuranolone cohort, approximately 70% of participants with a clinical response to an initial 2-week treatment required at most one additional zuranolone treatment during their time in the 12-month study. Of the 489 patients continuing in the study, 210 (42.9%) patients received only the single initial zuranolone course during their time in the study, while 125 (25.6%) received a total of two courses, 58 (11.9%) received a total of three courses, 53 (10.8%) received a total of four courses, and 43 (8.8%) received a total of five courses. In the 30 mg cohort, 368 (51%) patients reported at least one TEAE. The most common TEAEs that were reported by ≥ 5% of patients treated with zuranolone were somnolence (86; 11.9%), headache (103; 14.2%), and dizziness (54; 7.4%). Most of the reported TEAEs were mild or moderate.
 We are also conducting the SKYLARK Study, from which we expect to report topline results in mid-2022.
 
In September 2021, Shionogi announced that it achieved the primary endpoints from a Phase 2 clinical trial of zuranolone for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe MDD in Japan. The data reported by Shionogi for this Phase 2 study showed significant improvement over placebo from day three (first observation) to day 15 (end of administration) of change in HAMD-17 total score from baseline in a group of 80 patients who received zuranolone 20 mg once daily for two weeks and a group of 85 patients who received 30 mg once daily for two weeks, as compared to 82 patients who received the placebo. Shionogi reported that all adverse events were mild or moderate. Shionogi previously completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan to evaluate the safety and tolerability of zuranolone in Japanese and Caucasian subjects.
 
We may consider additional development opportunities for zuranolone as part of the Biogen collaboration.
 
SAGE-324 
 In addition to zuranolone, we have a portfolio of other novel compounds that target GABAA receptors, including SAGE-324, which we are jointly developing with Biogen under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement. SAGE-324 is a 
 14

novel GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator intended for chronic oral dosing. In April 2021, we and Biogen reported topline results from our placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of SAGE-324 for the treatment of essential tremor, known as the KINETIC Study. Essential tremor is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by rhythmic trembling most commonly of the upper limbs, including the hands. The head, voice, legs or trunk may also be affected. Symptoms generally evolve over time, are persistent, and affect patients’ ability to function independently. Essential tremor is among the most common movement disorders, estimated to affect more than 6 million adults in the U.S., with increasing prevalence among patients 50 years and older. First-line treatments for essential tremor include β-adrenergic blocker propranolol and anticonvulsant primidone.
The Phase 2 KINETIC Study evaluating SAGE-324 for the treatment of adults with essential tremor (n=67 full analysis set) achieved its primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction from baseline compared to placebo in The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale, or TETRAS, Performance Subscale Item 4 upper limb tremor score on Day 29 (p-value=0.049), which corresponded to a 36% reduction from baseline in upper limb tremor amplitude in patients receiving SAGE-324 compared to a 21% reduction in patients receiving placebo. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive SAGE-324 (60 mg) or matched placebo once daily in the morning. The trial evaluated treatment of SAGE-324 at the higher end of the dose range and the daily dose could be down-titrated to 45 mg or 30 mg. Activities of daily living, or ADL, scores showed a statistically significant correlation with upper limb tremor score at all timepoints. Although the clinical trial was not powered to fully examine TETRAS ADL, SAGE-324 was numerically superior to placebo at all time points during treatment. Reported TEAEs were generally consistent with the safety profile of SAGE-324 previously reported. The most common TEAEs that were reported by 10% or more of patients in the SAGE-324 treatment group and at a rate at least twice as high as that of patients in the placebo group were: somnolence 68%; dizziness 38%; balance disorder 15%; diplopia 12%; dysarthria 12%; and gait disturbance 12%. In the KINETIC Study, patients with a more severe tremor at baseline (at or above the median TETRAS Performance Subscale upper limb tremor Item 4 score of 12) (n=47) who received SAGE-324 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction (p-value=0.007) from baseline in TETRAS Performance Subscale Item 4 upper limb tremor score compared to placebo at Day 29, corresponding to a 41% reduction from baseline in upper limb tremor amplitude in patients receiving SAGE-324 compared to an 18% reduction for placebo. 
 In late 2021, we initiated a Phase 2b double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of SAGE-324 in patients with moderate to severe essential tremor, known as the KINETIC 2 Study. The primary aim of the KINETIC 2 Study is to evaluate different doses of SAGE-324 in reducing upper limb tremors. The primary endpoint of the study is change from baseline in TETRAS Performance Subscale Item 4 total score at Day 91. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety of SAGE-324 in patients with essential tremor in mid-2022. We believe SAGE-324 also has potential for the treatment of a number of other neurological conditions, including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.

We are jointly developing SAGE-324 in the U.S. with Biogen, and will jointly commercialize Licensed 324 Products with Biogen in the U.S. if our development efforts are successful and SAGE-324 is approved in the U.S. We have granted Biogen sole rights to develop and commercialize SAGE-324 outside the U.S. We may consider additional development plans and opportunities for SAGE-324 as part of our collaboration with Biogen.
 
SAGE-718
 Our second area of focus is the development of novel compounds that target the NMDA receptor. Examples of indications involving NMDA receptor dysfunction include certain types, aspects or subpopulations of a number of diseases such as Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and neuropathic pain. 
 Our lead product candidate selected in this area is SAGE-718, an oxysterol-based positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, which we are exploring in certain cognition-related disorders associated with NMDA receptor dysfunction, including cognition dysfunction associated with diseases such as Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. 
 Huntington’s disease
 SAGE-718 is currently being studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-718 in patients with Huntington’s disease cognitive impairment, known as the DIMENSION Study, which is designed to evaluate the efficacy of once-daily dosed SAGE-718 over three months. Dosing in the DIMENSION Study commenced in 
 15

early 2022. We plan to initiate, in mid-2022, a second placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-718 in patients with Huntington’s disease cognitive impairment, with a healthy volunteer component, known as the SURVEYOR Study, with the goal of generating evidence linking efficacy signals on cognitive performance to domains of real-world functioning. We are also planning to initiate a Phase 3 open-label extension study of SAGE-718 in patients with Huntington’s disease cognitive impairment, expected to be initiated in late 2022. The FDA has granted SAGE-718 Fast Track designation as a potential treatment for Huntington’s disease.
 Parkinson’s disease
 In May 2021, we announced results from the first part of a Phase 2a open-label clinical trial of SAGE-718 evaluating patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Parkinson’s disease, known as the PARADIGM Study. In this clinical trial, eight patients aged 50 to 75 years with mild cognitive impairment due to Parkinson’s disease received 3 mg of SAGE-718 daily for 14 days. Patients showed performance improvements from baseline on multiple tests in the cognitive domain of executive function during the 14 days of treatment. Emerging signals on several measures also suggested improved performance from baseline on cognitive tests in the domains of learning and memory over a similar timeframe. SAGE-718 was generally well-tolerated in the study; there were no serious adverse events reported, and no TEAEs were determined to be related to SAGE-718 or resulted in study drug discontinuation or withdrawal from the study. As expected, given its profile, SAGE-718 demonstrated neutral results in certain tests of attention and psychomotor speed. A four-week dosing cohort in the PARADIGM Study is ongoing to gather additional data in the Parkinson’s disease patient population. In addition, we plan to initiate a placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-718 in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Parkinson’s disease in mid-2022.
 Alzheimer’s disease
 In December 2021, we reported topline data from the LUMINARY Study, a Phase 2a open-label clinical trial of SAGE-718 in patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (n=26 full analysis set), who received 3 mg of SAGE-718 daily for 14 days. The results showed performance improvements from baseline on five out of five unique tests in the cognitive domain of executive function and two out of four unique tests in the cognitive domains of learning and memory during the 14 days of treatment, consistent with positive signals seen in clinical trials evaluating SAGE-718 as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease. Patients also showed performance improvement as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Test, a global measure of cognition, that reached statistical significance at Day 28 when compared to baseline in patients treated with SAGE-718. In certain tests of attention and psychomotor speed, SAGE-718 demonstrated neutral results. SAGE-718 was generally well tolerated in the LUMINARY Study. Seven subjects reported a total of 11 TEAEs, seven of which were considered related to the study treatment and all of which were rated as mild or moderate in severity. The most commonly reported TEAEs were headache (n=2) and constipation (n=2). We plan to initiate a randomized placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-718 in patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease in late 2022.
 
Further Exploration of GABAA and NMDA Receptors and New Areas of Interest
 We expect to continue to focus our research and development efforts on allosteric modulation of the GABAA and NMDA receptor systems in the brain. Our portfolio of novel GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators includes SAGE-689, a product candidate in Phase 1 clinical development intended for intramuscular administration. We also have other compounds at earlier stages of development with a focus on both acute and chronic brain health disorders, including SAGE-319, an extrasynaptic GABAA receptor-preferring positive allosteric modulator that we plan to study for potential use as an oral therapy in treating disorders of social interaction. We also have earlier stage compounds focused on NMDA receptor modulation, including SAGE-421, an NMDA receptor positive allosteric modulator that we plan to study for potential use in neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive recovery and rehabilitation. We recently decided to discontinue development of SAGE-904, another NMDA receptor positive allosteric modulator, following results from the Phase 1 clinical program that showed SAGE-904 did not achieve our target product profile for further development. The GABAA and NMDA receptor systems are broadly accepted as impacting many psychiatric and neurological disorders, spanning disorders of mood, seizure, cognition, anxiety, sleep, pain, and movement among others. We believe that we may have opportunities to develop molecules from our internal portfolio to address a number of these disorders in the future. Our ability to identify and develop such novel brain health therapies is enabled by our proprietary chemistry platform that is centered, as a starting point, on knowledge of the chemical scaffolds of certain endogenous neuroactive steroid compounds. We believe our knowledge of the chemistry and activity of allosteric modulators allows us to efficiently design molecules with different characteristics. This diversity enables us to regulate important properties such as half-life, brain penetration and receptor pharmacology to develop product candidates that have the potential for better 
 16

selectivity, increased tolerability, and fewer off-target side effects than either current therapies or previous therapies which have failed in development. We believe that we may also have the opportunity to use our scientific approach to explore targets beyond the GABAA and NMDA receptor systems and to develop compounds in areas of unmet need outside of brain health disorders.
 We believe our broad potential pipeline lessens our reliance on the success of any one program. We believe our ability to design and develop novel molecules with distinct profiles and receptor subtype selectivity may also provide us with the option, if we choose, to potentially partner certain assets with third parties who possess the development and commercialization capabilities to pursue these programs, like our recent strategic collaboration with Biogen. We may also evaluate opportunities to acquire new compounds, product candidates or products from other companies or from academic institutions if we believe such opportunities will help us achieve our goals or meet other strategic objectives.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We neither own nor operate, and currently have no plans to own or operate, any manufacturing facilities. We currently source all of our clinical and non-clinical material supply through third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs. We have also sourced our existing inventory of our proprietary formulation of ZULRESSO for commercial sale from CMOs, and intend to source all of our future commercial supplies of ZULRESSO and zuranolone and other product candidates, if approved by the FDA, from CMOs.
 We have long-term supply agreements with our CMOs with respect to ZULRESSO drug substance and drug product. We have an inventory of ZULRESSO drug substance and drug product in place to help mitigate any potential supply risks. All commercial supplies are intended to be manufactured applying current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP.
 We have established relationships with several CMOs under which the CMOs manufacture clinical and non-clinical supplies of drug substance and drug product for zuranolone, SAGE-324, SAGE-718 and other product candidates on a purchase order basis under master service and quality agreements. All clinical supplies of drug substance and drug product are intended to be manufactured under cGMP. Starting materials and key intermediates to support the production of these product candidates are manufactured by other CMOs. We do not currently have arrangements in place for either long-term supply or redundant supply of drug substance or drug product for zuranolone, SAGE-324, or SAGE-718. We intend to put a long-term supply agreement in place at the appropriate time for drug substance and drug product for zuranolone and each other product candidate, if development continues. We plan to mitigate potential commercial supply risks for any products that are approved in the future through inventory management and through exploring additional manufacturers to provide drug substance or drug product.
 We are currently working with our CMOs to prepare for validation and commercial manufacturing of zuranolone, if we are successful in our efforts to file for and gain regulatory approval in the U.S. We also intend to improve the manufacturing process for our other product candidates and manufacture clinical supplies as development progresses. We believe we currently have sufficient zuranolone drug substance on hand for our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.
 ZULRESSO, zuranolone, SAGE-324 and SAGE-718 are small molecules isolated as stable crystalline solids. We believe the syntheses of ZULRESSO, zuranolone, SAGE-324 and SAGE-718 are reliable and reproducible from readily available starting materials, and the synthetic routes are amenable to large-scale manufacturing and do not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to identify and develop drug candidates that are amenable to cost-effective manufacturing at contract manufacturing facilities. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our first product, ZULRESSO, was made commercially available in the U.S. as a treatment for PPD in adults in June 2019. Our revenue from sales of ZULRESSO has been negatively impacted by significant barriers arising from the complex requirements for treatment and, more recently, by the COVID-19 pandemic, and these factors are expected to continue to impact revenues negatively in the future. ZULRESSO is administered as a continuous infusion given over two and a half days. Because of the risk of serious harm resulting from excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness during the ZULRESSO infusion, ZULRESSO is approved for administration only in a medically-supervised healthcare 
 17

setting that has been certified under a REMS program and meets the other requirements of the REMS program, including requirements related to monitoring of the patient during the infusion. The actions required for a healthcare setting to be ready and willing to treat women with PPD are complex and time-consuming. These actions include becoming REMS-certified; achieving formulary approvals; establishing protocols for administering ZULRESSO; and securing satisfactory reimbursement. Sites must often negotiate reimbursement on a payor-by-payor basis under commercial coverage. The availability, terms and timing of coverage for ZULRESSO vary from payor to payor, both for commercially insured patients and from state Medicaid systems, and we have encountered some states that impose significant coverage restrictions or lengthy delays on reimbursement of ZULRESSO. As a result, certain healthcare settings will not treat Medicaid patients with ZULRESSO even if they are active sites of care for ZULRESSO. These requirements have created significant barriers to treatment for women with PPD. We expect these barriers will continue to negatively impact ZULRESSO revenue growth.
 These barriers have been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. has resulted in a significant number of sites of care pausing, limiting or delaying treatment of new patients with ZULRESSO and potential new sites of care pausing site activation activities for a period of time. We believe concerns about exposure to the virus or its variants as well as the disruption to the healthcare system in the U.S. caused by the pandemic have also caused a significant reduction in the number of women with PPD seeking treatment with ZULRESSO and in the number of physicians willing to prescribe it. Given the continuing concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic across the country, including as a result of the spread of variants and “breakthrough” cases among fully vaccinated people, and the resulting disruption in many locations to healthcare resources, we expect the significant adverse impact of the pandemic on ZULRESSO revenues, and our results of operations from sales of ZULRESSO, to continue for the foreseeable future. The scope and timing of the expected negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on, among other factors, the scope and duration of the pandemic and the timing of any return to normal business operations across the U.S.; the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns, vaccine mandates, and other efforts to control the pandemic; the extent of healthcare staffing shortages; impact on customers and vendors; and the duration and severity of restrictive measures taken to curb the spread of COVID-19. Given the continued fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict its course or for how long and to what extent it will have an adverse impact on ZULRESSO sales.
 Our ZULRESSO commercial operations, including our account management field-based team and sales representatives, are primarily focused on geographies that have existing, active ZULRESSO treating sites. We expect that this approach to our commercial efforts may continue to substantially limit the revenue opportunity for ZULRESSO. Given the limited focus of our commercial efforts and the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of new healthcare settings that become treating sites for ZULRESSO may be very limited for the foreseeable future. We may also find that certain healthcare settings that have in the past been active treating sites may not be willing to remain infusion-ready as a result of the complex requirements related to administration of ZULRESSO and compliance with the REMS, related limitations and restrictions, or because of actual or perceived difficulties obtaining satisfactory reimbursement or limitations on reimbursement or for other reasons. Healthcare settings that are active sites may also limit capacity used for ZULRESSO infusions or continue to wait to gain more experience with the clinical profile of ZULRESSO and to secure direct experience with reimbursement prior to increasing patient intake. Sage Central, our patient support center located in Raleigh, North Carolina, continues to provide a range of patient support resources to assist women with PPD and their families in the ZULRESSO treatment journey. In addition, our commercialization infrastructure includes capabilities in medical affairs, market access, manufacturing, quality control, drug safety and pharmacovigilance, health economics and outcomes research (HEOR), and compliance.
 We plan to continue to evaluate opportunities to raise awareness and help reduce hurdles to appropriate treatment for women with PPD. For example, in 2021, we initiated an open-label clinical trial designed to assess the safe-use administration of ZULRESSO in a patient’s home for the treatment of PPD, known as the SUNBIRD Study, which is anticipated to be completed in late 2022.
 Permitted pre-launch planning and launch-readiness activities for zuranolone are underway, and we are actively working on our commercialization strategy with Biogen in the event we are successful in our efforts to file for and gain regulatory approval of zuranolone in the U.S. We expect that we will need substantial additional sales and marketing capabilities in the U.S. if zuranolone receives regulatory approval for MDD and/or PPD, as it may be prescribed by both specialty physicians (such as psychiatrists, neurologists and obstetricians/gynecologists) and primary care physicians. We also plan to leverage additional promotional strategies to provide product and disease education to healthcare providers 
 18

and patients with MDD and PPD if zuranolone is approved. These strategies include, but are not limited to, direct-to-patient and direct-to-consumer advertising delivered through a range of media, as well as online physician education. As described above, we and Biogen have agreed as part of our collaboration that, if zuranolone and SAGE-324 are successfully developed and approved, we will jointly commercialize the products in the U.S., including sharing equally in sales and marketing activities and profits and losses in the U.S. If we obtain regulatory approval of such products, Biogen will book sales of Licensed 217 Products and we will book sales of Licensed 324 Products. We have granted Biogen sole rights to commercialize the Licensed Products outside the U.S., other than in the Shionogi Territory with respect to zuranolone, where we have granted such rights to Shionogi.
 Licenses 
 We have entered into several material license agreements with respect to our product and clinical-stage product candidates, which are described below.
 CyDex Pharmaceuticals
 In September 2015, we amended and restated our existing commercial license agreement with CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or CyDex. Under the terms of the commercial license agreement, as amended and restated, CyDex has granted us an exclusive license to CyDex’s Captisol drug formulation technology and related intellectual property for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products incorporating brexanolone and the Company’s compound known as SAGE-689, and the development and commercialization of the resulting products for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of any disease or symptom in humans or animals other than (i) the ocular treatment of any disease or condition with a formulation, including a hormone; (ii) topical ocular treatment of inflammatory conditions; (iii) treatment and prophylaxis of fungal infections in humans; and (iv) any ocular treatment for retinal degeneration.
 Pursuant to the CyDex license, we are required during the term of the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue active, diligent development of the licensed product, to seek regulatory approval of the licensed product and to commercialize the licensed product following regulatory approval. We must deliver periodic progress reports to CyDex.
 We are obligated to make milestone payments under the amended and restated license agreement with CyDex based on the achievement of clinical development and regulatory milestones in the amount of up to $0.8 million in clinical milestones and up to $3.8 million in regulatory milestones for each of the first two fields with respect to brexanolone; up to $1.3 million in clinical milestones and up to $8.5 million in regulatory milestones for each of the third and fourth fields with respect to brexanolone; and up to $0.8 million in clinical milestones and up to $1.8 million in regulatory milestones for one field with respect to SAGE-689. The CyDex license is perpetual until terminated. We may terminate the CyDex agreement for convenience upon providing 180 days’ prior written notice to CyDex. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement for failure to cure a material breach in the applicable cure period. We pay royalties to CyDex on sales of ZULRESSO, and will also be required to pay royalties on sales of SAGE-689, if successfully developed, in the low single digits based on levels of net sales. We met a clinical development milestone related to SAGE-689 under the CyDex license in late 2021, and accordingly made a $0.1 million payment to CyDex.
 We are also party to a supply agreement with CyDex. Under the supply agreement, we are required to purchase all of our requirements for Captisol with respect to brexanolone and SAGE-689 from CyDex, and CyDex is required to supply us with Captisol for such purposes, subject to certain limitations.
 University of California
 In October 2013, we entered into a license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, or the Regents, which was amended in May 2014. Pursuant to this agreement, and subject to certain rights of the U.S. government and rights retained by the Regents, the Regents granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferable license under all personal property rights of the Regents covering the tangible personal property in an investigational new drug, or IND, application package owned by the Regents, or the Data, and a specified quantity of cGMP grade allopregnanolone, or the Material, to (i) use the Data for reference or incorporation in an IND for the use of the Material as a treatment of status epilepticus, or SE, essential tremor and/or PPD and (ii) use the Material or modifications of the Material to develop a 
 19

pharmaceutical formulation for clinical trials for SE, essential tremor and/or PPD. The rights licensed to us are not sublicensable.
 
This agreement required us to make up to $0.1 million in milestone payments in connection with the first derived product that met the relevant milestones, all of which we have already paid. We must also pay royalties of less than 1% to the Regents on ZULRESSO and for each other derived product, if any, for a period of 15 years following the first commercial sale of such derived product. This agreement will terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) 27 years after the effective date or (ii) 15 years after the last-derived product is first commercially sold. We may terminate this agreement early for convenience upon providing 60 days’ prior written notice to the Regents. The Regents may terminate this agreement early in the event of material default, including failure to provide timely progress reports, after the applicable cure period, or in the event of our bankruptcy. In the event of early termination of this agreement, we have the right to sell any partially made derived products for a period of 120 days from the date of termination, but would not otherwise have rights after termination under the licensed rights to make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale or import products containing allopregnanolone.
 In June 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Regents whereby we were granted an exclusive license to certain patent rights related to the use of allopregnanolone to treat various diseases. In exchange for such license, we paid an upfront payment of $50,000, and made annual maintenance fees of $15,000 until the calendar year following the first sale of ZULRESSO. We are obligated to make milestone payments following the achievement of specified regulatory and sales milestones of up to $0.7 million and $2.0 million in the aggregate, respectively. We pay royalties to the Regents at a low single digit percentage of net sales of ZULRESSO, subject to specified minimum annual royalty amounts. Unless terminated by operation of law or by acts of the parties under the terms of the agreement, the license agreement will terminate when the last-to-expire patents or last-to-be abandoned patent applications expire, whichever is later.
 Collaboration and License Agreement with Biogen
In November 2020, we entered into the Biogen Collaboration Agreement with Biogen for the development, manufacture and commercialization of Licensed 217 Products and Licensed 324 Products, which became effective in December 2020.
 We and Biogen have agreed that we will jointly develop and commercialize the Licensed Products in the U.S., and that Biogen solely will develop and commercialize the Licensed Products outside the U.S., except, with respect to the Licensed 217 Products, in the Shionogi Territory. Each of we and Biogen is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one product in each Product Class in the U.S., and Biogen is also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one product in each Product Class in the Biogen Territory. We and Biogen have agreed to share jointly in the performance of the activities under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement in the U.S. and to share all costs for activities under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement solely for the U.S. equally. The Biogen Collaboration Agreement provides that Biogen has sole responsibility and decision-making authority with respect to such activities in the Biogen Territory. Biogen is solely responsible for all costs for activities under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement in the Biogen Territory. We have an Opt-Out Right (as defined below) in the U.S. with respect to a Product Class.
 We have granted to Biogen a non-transferable, sublicensable, except for certain specified exceptions, license to certain of our intellectual property as needed to perform the activities under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement. Such license is co-exclusive with us in the U.S. and exclusive, even as to us, in the Biogen Territory, subject to certain retained rights to allow us to exercise our rights and perform our obligations under the Agreement and with respect to the Shionogi Territory.
 Our activities for the U.S. are conducted pursuant to joint development plans agreed to by us and Biogen, on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, and overseen by a joint steering committee, or the JSC. The JSC is composed of an equal number of representatives from each of us and Biogen.
 20

Under the terms of the Biogen Collaboration Agreement, Biogen paid us an upfront payment of $875.0 million on December 31, 2020. For so long as a Licensed Product is being sold in the U.S., we and Biogen will share in all operating profits and losses arising from such Licensed Product in the U.S. (50 percent us and 50 percent Biogen). The Biogen Collaboration Agreement provides that Biogen will book sales of Licensed 217 Products globally. We will book sales of Licensed 324 Products in the U.S. and Biogen will book sales of Licensed 324 Products outside of the U.S., in each case if Licensed Products are successfully developed and approved. We have the right to opt out of such profit- and loss-sharing on a Product Class-by-Product Class basis in the U.S., or in each case, an Opt-Out Right. If we elect to exercise our Opt-Out Right with respect to a Product Class, we have agreed to transition to Biogen applicable development and commercial activities for such Product Class for the U.S., and Biogen has agreed to assume sole operational and financial responsibility for such activities.
 The Biogen Collaboration Agreement provides for aggregate regulatory/commercial milestone payments from Biogen to us for (i) Licensed 217 Products of up to $475.0 million and (ii) Licensed 324 Products of up to $520.0 million. It also provides for aggregate one-time sales milestone payments from Biogen to us of (i) up to $300.0 million for each Product Class if we have not exercised our Opt-Out Right with respect to such Product Class and (ii) up to $525.0 million for each Product Class if we have exercised our Opt-Out Right with respect to such Product Class.
 Biogen has also agreed to pay us tiered royalties based on net sales of the Licensed Products in the Biogen Territory of high-teens to low-twenties percentages. If we have exercised our Opt-Out Right in the U.S. with respect to a Product Class, Biogen has agreed to pay us specified royalties based on net sales of the Licensed Products of such Product Class. Royalty payments may be reduced in certain specified customary circumstances. Due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development, we may never receive any milestone payments or any royalty payments from Biogen.
 During the term of the Biogen Collaboration Agreement, neither us nor Biogen nor any of our respective affiliates is permitted outside of the Biogen Collaboration Agreement to directly or indirectly develop, manufacture, conduct medical affairs activities or commercialize certain products in specified indications, or enter into agreements or arrangements with third parties to perform any of the above activities.
 Unless earlier terminated, the Biogen Collaboration Agreement expires on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis on the later of (i) in the Biogen Territory, the expiration of the royalty term for such Licensed Product in such country or (ii) in the U.S., until the parties agree to permanently stop commercializing such Licensed Product. Biogen may terminate the Biogen Collaboration Agreement for convenience in its entirety or on a Product Class-by-Product Class basis or as to a region by providing advance written notice. Either us or Biogen may terminate the Biogen Collaboration Agreement (i) in the event of a material breach in whole or in part, by the other party subject to a cure period and (ii) in the event of the insolvency of the other party, in each case subject to specified conditions.
 In connection with the execution of the Biogen Collaboration Agreement, we and BIMA also entered into a stock purchase agreement, or the Biogen Stock Purchase Agreement, for the sale and issuance of 6,241,473 shares of our common stock, or the Biogen Shares, to BIMA at a price of approximately $104.14 per share, a premium of 40% over the volume-weighted average share price for the 30 days ending on the day prior to entry into the Biogen Stock Purchase Agreement, for an aggregate purchase price of $650.0 million. The sale of the Biogen Shares was consummated on December 31, 2020. 
 We have granted BIMA specified demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the Biogen Shares. The Biogen Stock Purchase Agreement also includes standstill provisions, lock-up restrictions and a voting agreement with respect to the Biogen Shares. Pursuant to the terms of the Biogen Stock Purchase Agreement, BIMA has agreed not to, and to cause its affiliates not to, directly or indirectly acquire our securities, seek or propose a tender or exchange offer or merger between us and BIMA, solicit proxies or consents with respect to any matter, or undertake other specified actions, in each case subject to specified conditions. The standstill restrictions terminate on the earliest of (i) a specified regulatory milestone under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement, (ii) the date one year following the termination of the Biogen Collaboration Agreement and (iii) December 28, 2027.
 21

BIMA has also agreed not to, and to cause its affiliates not to, sell or transfer any of the Biogen Shares for a period of eighteen months from the closing of the sale of the Biogen Shares, which period expires June 30, 2022, and to limit sales and transfers of the Shares for an additional eighteen-month period, in each case subject to specified conditions and exceptions.
 Collaboration Agreement with Shionogi & Co., Ltd.
 In June 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Shionogi. Pursuant to this agreement, Shionogi is responsible for all clinical development, regulatory filings and commercialization of products containing zuranolone for the treatment of MDD and potentially other indications in the Shionogi Territory. Shionogi made an upfront payment of $90.0 million in 2018, and we will be eligible to receive additional payments of up to $485.0 million if certain regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved by Shionogi.
 Under the terms of the agreement, the potential future milestone payments include up to $70.0 million for the achievement of specified regulatory milestones, up to $30.0 million for the achievement of specified commercialization milestones, and up to $385.0 million for the achievement of specified net sales milestones. We will receive tiered royalties on sales of zuranolone in the Shionogi Territory, if development efforts are successful, with tiers averaging in the low to mid-twenty percent range, subject to other terms of the agreement. Due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development, we may not receive any additional milestone payments or any royalty payments from Shionogi.
 Shionogi has also granted us certain rights to co-promote zuranolone in Japan. As between us and Shionogi, we maintain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize zuranolone outside of the Shionogi Territory. The upfront cash payment and any payments for milestones and royalties are non-refundable and non-creditable.
 The agreement with Shionogi will terminate on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis on the date on which the royalty term has expired in each country in Shionogi’s territory for such licensed product and will ultimately expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. Shionogi may remove South Korea or Taiwan from the covered territories, for any reason or no reason upon 180 days’ prior written notice. Shionogi may terminate the agreement in its entirety for any reason or no reason upon 180 days’ prior written notice. Shionogi may also terminate the agreement in the event of a serious adverse event or a clinical failure upon 60 days’ written notice to us. Either party may terminate this agreement early in the event of an uncured material breach within 180 days’ after notice is delivered to the other party. 
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary know-how and technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We may also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. To protect our rights to our proprietary know-how and technology, we require all employees, as well as our consultants and contract research organization, or CROs, when feasible, to enter into agreements that generally require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants, and CROs in the course of their service to us.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of use, treatment and patient selection, formulations and manufacturing processes created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation and may pursue in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
 22

The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the U.S., permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing, or may in the future pursue, will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will be enforceable or provide sufficient protection from competitors.
 Because patent applications in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by our issued patents, our pending patent applications or of patent applications we may file in the future. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, or similar proceedings outside the U.S., to determine priority of invention.
 Patents
 We hold issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S., and in certain foreign countries. Our intellectual property holdings include, but are not limited to:

• | One issued U.S. patent, exclusively licensed to us, covering a method of using our proprietary brexanolone formulation to treat PPD, which will expire in 2033; one U.S. issued patent and one granted patent in Europe covering our proprietary formulation of brexanolone, which will expire in 2033; and one U.S. issued patent covering the dosage regimen of brexanolone to treat PPD, which will expire in 2037;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pending U.S. and foreign patent applications covering certain aspects of brexanolone, including courses of treatment, dosage regimens, methods for manufacturing, and additional uses of the formulation of brexanolone to treat various brain health diseases and disorders, including PPD;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These patents and patent applications are co-owned with Washington University, and Sage has an exclusive license to Washington University’s rights in these patents and patent applications; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications covering SAGE-718 and many other modulators of the NMDA receptor, and uses of these compounds to treat various brain health diseases and disorders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patent Term
 The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the U.S. PTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
 The term of a U.S. patent may also be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA 
 23

approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug, and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, also have patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extension on patents covering those products, their methods of use, and/or methods of manufacture.
 
Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we may rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Companies typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of their business that are not amenable to, or that they do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets, if any, and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, and, where feasible, with consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and certain other entities with whom we do business. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all relevant inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, designed to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Competition
 The biopharmaceuticals industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products or targeting similar indications will increase.
 Currently, there are no pharmacological therapies specifically approved for the treatment of PPD other than ZULRESSO. Current standard of care for PPD commonly consists of psychotherapy; however, patients with moderate or severe PPD are often prescribed antidepressant medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs.
 Our most advanced product candidate, zuranolone, is being developed for the treatment of MDD and PPD. Patients with MDD are typically treated with a variety of antidepressant medications, including SSRIs, SNRIs and atypical antipsychotics. If successfully developed and approved, zuranolone may also face competition from esketamine, which is approved for the treatment of treatment resistant depression. A number of companies are developing product candidates intended for the treatment of MDD, including NMDA receptor antagonists or partial antagonists such as dextromethorphan/ bupropion. In April 2021, Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. announced that the FDA had accepted and granted priority review to the NDA package for its NMDA receptor antagonist, AXS-05, which has previously received Breakthrough Therapy designation for MDD, but the expected Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or PDUFA, target action date of August 2021 has been delayed. In addition, if zuranolone is successfully developed and approved for PPD, it could reduce our commercial opportunity for ZULRESSO.
 In the field of neuroactive steroids focused specifically on modulation of GABAA receptors, we also face competition from a number of companies, including Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Marinus, and Praxis Precision Medicines, or Praxis. In September 2021, Marinus announced that the FDA had accepted for filing and granted priority review of the NDA for its product candidate ganaxolone, a known GABAA positive allosteric modulator neuroactive steroid, to treat seizures associated with CDKL5 deficiency disorder, a rare, genetic epilepsy. Marinus has announced that the FDA has set a PDUFA target action date for ganaxolone for this indication for March 2022. Ganaxolone is also in Phase 3 development for status epilepticus and tuberous sclerosis complex. Praxis is developing PRAX-114, a GABAA receptor modulating neuroactive steroid, that is currently in Phase 2/3 development for MDD.
 SAGE-324, a novel GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, is in Phase 2 development for essential tremor. If successfully developed and approved as a treatment for essential tremor, SAGE-324 will face competition from current 
 24

first-line treatments which include β-adrenergic blocker propranolol and anticonvulsant primidone. SAGE-324 may also face competition from a T-type calcium channel modulator that Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is currently evaluating in Phase 2b development for essential tremor and a Phase 2 T-type calcium channel modulator being developed by Praxis.
 A number of companies are working to develop products targeted at the NMDA receptor, both antagonists and agonists. Aptinyx Inc. has multiple Phase 2 NMDA receptor modulators in development for multiple indications, including NYX-458 being developed for the treatment of cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease. 
 Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. We expect competition in the indications we are pursuing will focus on efficacy, safety, convenience, availability, and price. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring/pharmacovigilance, safety and periodic reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed in a given jurisdiction, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained and/or generated, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and the drug must be approved by the relevant regulatory authority or authorities.
U.S. Drug Development
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, and local statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject a company to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s delay or refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold on a clinical investigation, warning or untitled letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and generally involves the following:
  
• | Completion of extensive non-clinical studies and testing, sometimes referred to as non-clinical laboratory tests, non-clinical animal studies and formulation studies, in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 25

 
• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes collectively referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for marketing approval of a new drug;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept and file the NDA for review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of a potential FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Payment of applicable user fees and FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: non-clinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the non-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the non-clinical tests must comply with federal laws and regulations, including, for animal studies, the Animal Welfare Act and GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. Some non-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocols for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials, including whether subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or to patients with the disease or condition being studied under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. GCPs include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any given clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols describing, among other details, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants, and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with, as applicable, regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study patients, following the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 26

A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and compliance with informed consent principles, and FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in patients afflicted with the target disease to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients afflicted with the target disease at multiple sites (typically from several hundred to several thousand subjects), and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended for drugs intended for chronic dosing to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, increased rates of serious suspected adverse events, or findings from other studies or from animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Success in one phase does not mean that the results will be observed in subsequent phases. Each phase may involve multiple studies. If concerns arise about the safety of the product candidate, the FDA or other regulatory authorities can stop clinical trials by placing them on a “clinical hold” pending receipt of additional data, which can result in a delay or termination of a clinical development program. The sponsoring company, the FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial, and may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, we must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. 
 27

Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 NDA and FDA Review Process
 The results of non-clinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the U.S.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, the FDA may also issue a Written Request asking a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies related to a particular active moiety; if the sponsor agrees and meets certain requirements, the sponsor may be eligible to receive additional marketing exclusivity for its drug product containing such active moiety.
 Under PDUFA, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee, unless subject to a waiver. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2022, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is approximately $3.11 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug program fee for human drugs of approximately $0.3 million. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan-designated indication.
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA aims to complete its initial review of an NDA and respond to the applicant within 10 months from the filing date for a standard NDA and, and within six months from the filing date for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and integrity of the data submitted in the NDA. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. For example, the advisory committee may recommend or the FDA may determine that a REMS program is necessary to ensure safe use of the product. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation process for an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
 28

After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or one or more additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, non-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such additional data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
 There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the U.S., and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific patient populations and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA typically requires that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, and may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which may involve clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and/or efficacy and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS if the FDA determines that a REMS is required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. For example, the FDA has required a REMS for ZULRESSO to mitigate the potential for harm associated with the risk of excessive sedation and loss of consciousness during the ZULRESSO infusion. As part of the REMS, administration of ZULRESSO is limited to healthcare settings that have been certified under a REMS program under the supervision of qualified staff, and patients who are prescribed ZULRESSO are required to enroll in a patient registry which may allow us to compile additional information to further our understanding of the risk of serious harm resulting from excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness during administration of ZULRESSO and management of the risk. Any limitations on approval, marketing or use for any of our products could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of those products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements if problems occur following launch, or if FDA determines that the product is no longer safe or effective.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug product intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If orphan product designation is sought, it must be requested before submitting an NDA for the drug for the proposed rare disease or condition. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the common name of the therapeutic agent and its designated orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not, by itself, convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other sponsors’ applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity operates independently from other regulatory exclusivities and other protection against generic competition, including patents that we hold for our products. A sponsor of a product application that has received an orphan drug designation may also be granted tax incentives for clinical research undertaken to support the application. In addition, the FDA may coordinate with the sponsor on research study design for an orphan drug and may exercise its discretion to grant marketing approval on the basis of more limited product safety and efficacy data than would ordinarily be required, based on the limited size of the applicable patient population.
 29

Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. The FDA can revoke a product’s orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the holder of the approved orphan drug application is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet patient needs. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, benefits.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has several programs that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Fast Track designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation are two of these programs and apply to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the development of the product and may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Breakthrough Therapy based on preliminary clinical evidence which meet the criteria outlined in the FDA’s programs. Under the Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy expedited programs, the FDA may review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete NDA is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. 
 Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and offers a significant improvement in the safety and effectiveness of treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. Significant improvement may be shown by evidence of increased effectiveness for the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months from the date of the NDA filing. 
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if the product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening illness and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Accelerated approval for a product means that it may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug, such as:
  
• | distribution restricted to certain facilities or physicians with special training or experience; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | distribution conditioned on the performance of specified medical procedures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The limitations imposed would be commensurate with the specific safety concerns presented by the drug. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.

Pediatric Trials
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which was signed into law on July 9, 2012, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from non-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA, if it learns of new information, may also request that the sponsor amend the initial PSP.
 Post-Marketing Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the Internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act.
 FDA regulations also require that approved products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, administrative enforcement, warning or untitled letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil penalties or criminal prosecution, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from 
 31

new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Other Regulatory Matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Department of Health and Human Services; the U.S. Department of Justice; the DEA; the Consumer Product Safety Commission; the Federal Trade Commission; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; the Environmental Protection Agency; and state and local governments.
 In the U.S., a drug product approved by the FDA may also be subject to regulation under the CSA as a controlled substance. The CSA is administered by the DEA and establishes, among other things, certain registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements for controlled substances. The CSA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V. FDA approved pharmaceutical products may be listed in Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. An approved drug product or drug candidate that has not yet been approved by the FDA may be subject to scheduling as a controlled substance under the CSA, depending on the drug’s potential for abuse. For a drug approved by the FDA and determined to require control under the CSA, the CSA requires the DEA to issue an interim final order scheduling the drug within 90 days after the FDA approves the drug and the DEA receives a scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation from the Department of Health and Human Services, after it has been completed by FDA. FDA recommended, and DEA adopted, that brexanolone be scheduled as a schedule IV controlled substance.
 In the U.S., arrangements and interactions with health care professionals, third-party payors, patients and others expose us to broadly applicable anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims and other health care laws and regulations. These broadly applicable laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements or relationships through which we sell, market and distribute our approved product and any future products that may obtain marketing approval. In the U.S., federal and state health care laws and regulations that may affect our operations include:
  
• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a company marketing a prescription drug (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward the referral of an individual or purchase, lease or order, or the arranging for or recommending the purchase or order, of a particular item or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors, or speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance. Violations of this law may be punishable by up to ten years in prison, criminal fines, damages, administrative civil money penalties, and the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.

• | The federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the federal government or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Many pharmaceutical manufacturers have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper activities. The government may deem companies to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation may include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant civil penalties for each separate false or fraudulent claim, and the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.

• | Numerous federal and state laws, including state data breach notification laws, state health information and/or genetic privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act), govern the collection, use, and disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability, private litigation, or adverse publicity. In addition, we or our collaborators may obtain health information from third parties, such as hospitals, healthcare professionals, and research institutions, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations, or collectively, HIPAA. HIPAA imposes privacy and security obligations on covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, as well as their “business associates” – independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. Although we are not directly subject to the HIPAA information privacy and security provisions – other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits – we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. In addition, HIPAA does not replace federal, state, or other laws that may grant individuals even greater privacy protections.

• | The HIPAA fraud provisions, which impose criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

• | The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also are required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.

• | Analogous state and local laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, regardless of the payor. We also may become subject to other state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to clinical trials, or information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or

marketing expenditures; state laws and local ordinances that require identification or licensing of sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Substantial resources are necessary to ensure that our business arrangements and interactions with health care professionals, third-party payors, patients and others comply with applicable health care laws and regulations. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law, and if we are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.
 Numerous other laws may apply to our products. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, referred to herein as the ACA (addressed further below in the section on “U.S. Healthcare Reform”). If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Many states impose various requirements on pharmaceutical manufacturers to report development costs and pricing information when prices are increased. Penalties for late or faulty reporting can be significant. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the CSA and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act.
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, issuance of warning or untitled letters, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs’ attorneys have been and will likely continue to be active in this space. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
 Many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Many of the state laws enable a state attorney general to bring actions and provide private rights of action to consumers as enforcement mechanisms. There is also heightened sensitivity around certain types of health information, such as sensitive condition information or the health information of minors, which may be subject to additional protections. Compliance with these laws is difficult, constantly evolving, and time consuming. Changes in statutes, regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, if any, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term 
 34

Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, or the testing phase, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, or the approval phase. This patent term restoration period may be reduced by the FDA if it finds that applicant did not act with due diligence during the testing phase or the approval phase. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if circumstances permit, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our then owned or licensed patents, if any, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. Even if, at the relevant time, we have a valid issued patent covering our product, we may not be granted an extension if we were, for example, to fail to apply within applicable deadlines, to fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise to fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, and we do not have any other exclusivity, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration and our ability to generate revenues could be materially adversely affected.
 Some of our products may also be entitled to certain non-patent-related data exclusivity under the FDCA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA may not be submitted by another company for another drug containing the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA Orange Book by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a full NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. Three-year exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications that rely on the information that served as the basis of granting three-year exclusivity. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations, and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. We have obtained NCE exclusivity for brexanolone, and plan to seek NCE exclusivity for our current and future product candidates, if eligible.
 European Union Drug Development
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authorities in the EU has been obtained.
 Similar to the U.S., the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or the Clinical Trials Directive, has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive in a manner that is often not uniform. This has led to variations in the rules governing the conduct of clinical trials in the individual EU Member States. Under the regime of the Clinical Trials Directive, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each EU Member State where there is a site at which the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the 
 35

National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the regime of the Clinical Trials Directive, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 In order to streamline the regulation of clinical trials across the EU, the EU Parliament has adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the EU Clinical Trials Regulation. The new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, which repeals and replaces the Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure through a single entry point, referred to as the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation became effective on January 31, 2022 and is applicable directly in all countries of the EEA (which is comprised of 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). The new EU Clinical Trials Regulation allows for starting and conducting a clinical trial in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive during a transitional period of one year after the effective date of January 31, 2022. The transition period for the trials ongoing at the time of applicability will be a maximum of 3 years after the date of application of the EU Clinical Trials Regulation. Clinical trials authorized under the current Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2023 can continue to be conducted under the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. Any application to transition ongoing trials from the current Clinical Trials Directive to the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation will need to be submitted and authorized before the end of the transitional period. The new EU Clinical Trials Regulation is intended to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EEA. 
 In the EU, pediatric data or an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, or waiver, is required to have been approved by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, prior to submission of a marketing authorization application to the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU Member States. In some EU countries, we may also be required to have an approved PIP before we can begin enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial. 
 European Union Drug Review and Approval and Post-marketing Requirements
 In the EEA (which is comprised of 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after a related marketing authorization has been granted. Marketing authorization for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures. These are through a centralized, mutual recognition procedure, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (if marketing authorization is sought for a single EU Member State). The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the EMA. If a related positive opinion is provided by the EMA, the European Commission will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Associations countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), all of whom make up the EEA.
 The UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. Although marketing authorizations granted through the EU centralized procedure are valid in Northern Ireland, such marketing authorizations are not valid in the rest of the UK (England, Wales and Scotland, or collectively Great Britain). Until the end of 2022, a marketing authorization for Great Britain can be applied for through the UK European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure, after having received a positive opinion from the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. It is uncertain whether the UK European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure will remain available after 2022. 
 The EU centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which grant of centralized marketing authorization is in the interest of patients in the EU.
 The decentralized authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for authorization to several EU Member States simultaneously for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member 
 36

State. The competent authorities of a single EU Member State, the reference member state, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment. The only exception to this is where an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product. In these circumstances, the matter is submitted to the Heads of Medicines Agencies for review. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States.
 The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application in the EU is 210 days, not including clock stops during which applicants respond to questions from the competent authority. The initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years. The authorization may be renewed and valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the European Commission decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. The renewal of a marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities or the EMA.
 The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with the EU’s pharmacovigilance legislation. This includes requirements to conduct pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products.
 Various requirements apply to the manufacturing and placing on the EU market of medicinal products. Manufacture of medicinal products in the EU requires a manufacturing authorization, and import of medicinal products into the EU requires a manufacturing authorization allowing for import. The manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, including the manufacture of APIs outside of the EU with the intention to import the APIs into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. Marketing authorization holders and/or manufacturing authorization holders and/or distribution authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU Member States’ requirements applicable to the manufacturing of medicinal products.
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. For example, applicable laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities in connection with a marketing authorization approval. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the product. Promotional activity that does not comply with the SmPC is considered off-label and is prohibited in the EU. Breaches of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, which may include fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of medicinal products to the general public and may also impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.

European Union Regulatory Data Exclusivity
 In the EU, innovative medicinal products that are subject to marketing authorization on the basis of a full dossier and do not fall within the scope of the concept of global marketing authorization qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The concept of global marketing authorization prevents the same marketing authorization holder or members of the same group, or companies that have concluded tacit or explicit agreements concerning the marketing of the same medicinal product, from obtaining separate data and market exclusivity periods for medicinal products that contain the same active substance. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application or biosimilar application for eight years from the date of authorization of the innovative product, after which a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced. However, the generic product or biosimilar products cannot be marketed in the EU for a further two years thereafter. The overall ten-year period may be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 In the EU, orphan drug designations are granted by the European Commission based on a scientific opinion by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products in relation to medicinal products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU and in relation to which there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product.
 Orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of exclusivity in all EU Member States. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the product. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is deemed safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it is established that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met, such as if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 In addition, grant of orphan designation by the European Commission also entitles the holder of this designation to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation does not, in itself, convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and authorization process.
 European Union Data Protection
 EU Member States and other jurisdictions where we may in the future operate have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the sharing of personal data with third parties, the transfer of personal data out of the EU, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for violations of the data protection obligations. Obligations also include the need to conclude arrangements with clinical trials sites concerning data processing activities. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the GDPR and applicable related national laws differently and impose requirements additional to those provided in the GDPR. In 
 38

addition, guidance on implementation and compliance practices may be updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EEA. 
 In addition, the GDPR restricts the ability of companies to transfer personal data from the EEA to the U.S. and other countries, which may adversely affect our ability to transfer personal data or otherwise may cause us to incur significant costs to come into compliance with applicable data transfer impact assessments and implementation of legal data transfer mechanisms. One mechanism previously relied upon by U.S. companies for such transfers was the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, or Privacy Shield. However, in July 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled the Privacy Shield to be an invalid data transfer mechanism and confirmed that the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, or the Model Clauses, remain valid and in June 2021, the European Commission published updated versions of the Model Clauses, which must be incorporated into new and existing agreements within prescribed timeframes in order to continue to lawfully transfer personal data outside of the EU. As a result, companies may no longer rely on the Privacy Shield as a basis on which to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S. U.S.-based companies are permitted to rely on other authorized means and procedures to transfer personal data provided by the GDPR. The Model Clauses may also come under increased scrutiny as a result of the European Court of Justice’s judgement in July 2020, though they remain the most common authorized procedure to transfer personal data out of the EU. Following the European Court of Justice’s ruling, the European Data Protection Board issued a statement providing among other things that it is a primary responsibility of the exporter and the importer, when considering whether to rely on the Model Clauses to export data from the EU to third countries, to ensure that the importer maintains a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to that guaranteed by the GDPR in light of the EU Charter of Human Rights. Companies may need to revise the Model Clauses used in their contracts in light of the July 2020 judgement. Companies that have not taken steps to demonstrate that their Model Clauses and personal data recipients in the U.S. are suitable to transfer to receive the personal data may be subject to enforcement actions by competent authorities in the EU for failure to comply with related data privacy rules. 
 In addition, the privacy and data security landscape in the EU continues to remain in flux. The United Kingdom’s exit from the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to future data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision concerning the level of data protection in the UK. Personal data may now flow freely from the EEA to the UK; however, the European Commission may suspend the adequacy decision if it decides that the UK no longer provides for an adequate level of data protection.
 Rest of the World Regulation
 For other countries outside of the U.S., UK and EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 Approval by a regulatory authority in one jurisdiction does not guarantee approval by comparable regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements applicable to a given country, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in such country if we choose to seek such approval, or we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Changes in government legislation or regulation and changes in private third-party payors’ policies toward reimbursement for our products, if successfully developed and approved, may reduce reimbursement of our products’ costs to physicians, pharmacies, patients, and distributors. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of 
 39

price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results for products, if any, we commercialize in the future. 
 The pricing and reimbursement environment for our products may change in the future and become more challenging due to state and federal healthcare reform measures. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, for example, allocated new federal funding to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same condition. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although ARRA does not mandate the use of the results of comparative effectiveness studies for reimbursement purposes, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any products for which we receive marketing approval or on the reimbursement policies of public and private payors. It is possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of any product for which we receive marketing approval. For example, if third-party payors find our products not to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 The ACA is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals, the provision of subsidies to eligible individuals enrolled in plans offered on the health insurance exchanges, and the expansion of the Medicaid program. This law has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and has significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the “donut hole”), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, expansion of the Public Health Service Act’s 340B drug pricing program, or 340B program, and fraud and abuse enforcement. These changes have impacted previously existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the Medicare physician quality reporting system and feedback program.
 One of the goals of ACA was to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA increased minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations. The ACA also requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or ownership interest that is not timely, accurately, or completely reported (annual maximum of $150,000), and $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (annual maximum of $1 million). 
 Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the ACA. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact sales of our products that are approved and that we successfully commercialize, and our business and financial condition. Where Medicaid patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new options made available through the ACA, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues.
 
Certain provisions of the ACA have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to repeal or replace them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law in December 2017, included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment 
 40

imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” We expect that the ACA, its implementation, efforts to repeal or replace, or invalidate the ACA or portions thereof, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved.
 Other legislative changes relating to reimbursement have been adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. For example, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals for spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction, which triggered the legislation’s automatic reductions. In concert with subsequent legislation, this has resulted in aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year through 2030 (with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic). On December 10, 2021, President Biden signed a law that provides for 1% Medicare sequestration in the second quarter of 2022 and allows the full 2% sequestration thereafter until 2030. To offset the temporary suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2030, the sequestration will be 2.25% for the first half of the year, and 3% in the second half of the year. As long as these cuts remain in effect, they could adversely impact payment for any products we may commercialize in the future. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability.
 Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, or guidance could be adopted, which may impact potential marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved. For example, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory, and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to drug pricing practices. There have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, evaluate the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government healthcare program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the U.S. have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to report to state agencies when they introduce new drugs to market with prices over a certain threshold, or when they increase the price of a drug over a certain threshold. If healthcare policies or reforms intended to curb healthcare costs are adopted, the prices that we charge for any approved products may be limited, our commercial opportunity may be limited and/or our revenues from sales of our product and any future products, if approved, may be negatively impacted.
 It is possible that the ACA, as currently enacted or may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, and new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted in the U.S. or outside of the U.S., or whether regulatory changes, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be.
 Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
 Sales of ZULRESSO and any product candidates we successfully commercialize, if approved, in the future depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product or to manage utilization by, for example, requiring prior authorization, could reduce physician usage of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In the U.S., healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products through Medicare, Medicaid, and other government healthcare programs, as well as through commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that 
 41

will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 We participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental programs impose obligations to report certain pricing data to the federal government as well as other compliance obligations. Other programs impose limits on the price we are permitted to charge certain entities for our products. Statutory and regulatory changes or other agency action regarding these programs and their requirements could negatively affect the coverage and reimbursement by these programs of our products for which we receive regulatory approval and could negatively impact our results of operations or expand our rebate liability. For example, Congress recently expanded the availability of postpartum coverage under Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and could enact legislation that would extend rebates under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to all CHIP utilization. 
 Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being available for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug, which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any wholesaler, retailer, provider, health maintenance organization, nonprofit entity, or governmental entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts, and other price concessions. Where our average manufacturer price increases faster than the pace of inflation, we may be subject to an additional rebate in the amount that our average manufacturer price has exceeded the pace of inflation. Currently, the rebate is capped at 100 percent of the average manufacturer price, but, effective January 1, 2024, this cap on the rebate will be removed, and our rebate liability could increase accordingly.
 The ACA (addressed further above in the section on “U.S. Healthcare Reform”) made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and CMS issued a final regulation, which became effective on April 1, 2016, to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the ACA. On December 31, 2020, CMS issued a final regulation that modified prior Medicaid Drug Rebate Program regulations to permit reporting multiple best price figures with regard to value‑based purchasing arrangements (beginning in 2022); provide definitions for “line extension,” “new formulation,” and related terms, with the practical effect of expanding the scope of drugs considered to be line extensions that are subject to an alternative rebate formula (beginning in 2022); and revise best price and average manufacturer price exclusions of manufacturer-sponsored patient benefit programs, specifically regarding applicability of such exclusions in the context of pharmacy benefit manager “accumulator” programs (beginning in 2023). Our failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment options could negatively impact our financial results.
 Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The ACA expanded the list of covered entities to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, but exempts “orphan drugs” from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and, in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. Changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid Drug Rebate amount also could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.
 HRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that are found to have knowingly and intentionally overcharged covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. It is unclear how HRSA will apply its enforcement authority under the 
 42

regulation. We also are required to report our 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis, and HRSA then publishes them to covered entities. Moreover, under a final regulation effective January 13, 2021, HRSA newly established an administrative dispute resolution, or ADR, process for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer has engaged in overcharging, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. Such claims are to be resolved through an ADR panel of government officials rendering a decision that could be appealed only in federal court. An ADR proceeding could subject a manufacturer to onerous procedural requirements and result in additional liability.
 Federal law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program report average sales price information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under the Medicare Part B program. Manufacturers calculate the average sales price based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. Starting in 2023, manufacturers must pay refunds to Medicare for single source drugs or biologics, or biosimilar biological products, reimbursed under Medicare Part B and packaged in single-dose containers or single-use packages, for units of discarded drug reimbursed by Medicare Part B in excess of 10 percent of total allowed charges under Medicare Part B for that drug. Manufacturers that fail to pay refunds could be subject to civil monetary penalties of 125 percent of the refund amount.
 Statutory or regulatory changes or CMS guidance could affect the average sales price calculations for our approved products and the resulting Medicare payment rate, and could negatively impact our results of operations. Also, the Medicare Part B drug payment methodology is subject to change based on legislation enacted by Congress. For example, Congress could enact a Medicare Part B inflation rebate, under which manufacturers would owe additional rebates if the average sales price of a drug were to increase faster than the pace of inflation.
 Congress also could enact additional changes that affect our overall rebate liability and the information we report to the government as part of price reporting calculations. In addition, Congress could enact a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for certain high Medicare spend single source drugs would be capped by reference to the non-federal average manufacturer price. This or any other legislative change could impact the market conditions for our products. We further expect continued scrutiny on government price reporting and pricing more generally from Congress, agencies, and other bodies, and are seeing an increase in state interest in price reporting, transparency, and other policies to address drug pricing concerns.
 Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount will be computed each quarter based on our submission to CMS of our current average manufacturer prices and best prices for the quarter. If we become aware that our Medicaid reporting for a prior period was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed three years from the period in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products to covered entities under the 340B program, and may require us to issue refunds to 340B covered entities, which can be costly and burdensome.
 We could be held liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price for each misrepresentation and for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied, or if we are found to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price or best price information to the government, or to have misrepresented that information, we may be liable for significant civil monetary penalties per item of false information. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly average manufacturer price and best price data on a timely basis could result in a significant civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failures also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid program, or, if we fail to comply with 340B program requirements, HRSA could decide to terminate our 340B program participation agreement. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate 
 43

agreement or HRSA terminates our 340B program participation agreement, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.
 CMS and the Office of Inspector General have pursued manufacturers that were alleged to have failed to report these data to the government in a timely manner. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. We cannot guarantee that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect. 
 In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Department of Defense, or DoD, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard (collectively, the Big Four agencies) and certain federal grantees, we are required to participate in the VA Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program, established under Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, we are obligated to make our “covered” drugs (i.e., innovator drugs and biologics) available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to the Big Four agencies that is no higher than the Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP, which is a price calculated pursuant to a statutory formula. The FCP is derived from a calculated price point called the “non-federal average manufacturer price”, or Non-FAMP, which we are required to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties for each item of false information. The FSS contract also contains extensive disclosure and certification requirements. In addition, Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008, requires us to pay quarterly rebates to DoD on utilization of covered drugs that are dispensed through DoD’s Tricare network pharmacies to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP for the calendar year that the product was dispensed. If we overcharge the government in connection with the FSS contract or Tricare Retail Pharmacy Rebate Program, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we will be required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and any response to government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
 In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S., and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 In various EU Member States, we expect to be subject to continuous cost-cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative. Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including countries representing major markets. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. On January 31, 2018, the European Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on health technologies assessment. The proposal was adopted in December 2021 and will apply as of January 2025. This EU HTA Regulation is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas.
