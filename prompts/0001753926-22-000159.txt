Description of Business
 
Arax Holdings Corp. (the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 23, 2012 with a business plan to sell hot dogs from mobile hot dog stands throughout the major cities in Mexico. As of the filing of the 10K for 2016, the Company stated that it was re-evaluating its business plan.
 
We have been dormant from May 2005 through October 31, 2020. As of the date of this Report, we intend to engage in what we believe to be synergistic acquisitions or joint ventures with a company or companies that we believe will enhance our business plan. There are no assurances we will be able to consummate any acquisitions using our securities as consideration, or at all. Numerous things will need to occur to allow us to implement this aspect of our business plan and there are no assurances that any of these developments will occur, or if they do occur, that we will be successful in fully implementing our plan.
 
On December 30, 2020, as a result of a custodianship in Clark County, Nevada, Case Number: A-20-825346-B, Custodian Ventures LLC (“Custodian”) was appointed custodian of the Company. On the same date, Custodian appointed David Lazar as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
 
On June 24, 2021, as a result of a private transaction, 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the "Shares") of Arax Holdings Corp., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), were transferred from Custodian Ventures, LLC to Michael Pieter Loubser (the “Purchaser”). As a result, the Purchaser became an approximately 90.6% holder of the voting rights of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company on a fully-diluted basis of the Company, and became the controlling shareholder. In connection with the transaction, David Lazar released the Company from all debts owed to him and/or Custodian Ventures, LLC.
 
On June 24, 2021, the existing director and officer resigned immediately. Accordingly, David Lazar, serving as a director and an officer, ceased to be the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary and a Director. At the effective date of the transfer, Michael Pieter Loubser consented to act as the new Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, Ockert Cornelius Loubser consented to act as the new Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Rastislav Vašička consented to act as the new Chief Information Officer of the Company.

Competition and Market Conditions
 
We will face substantial competition in our efforts to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until such time as the economy recovers. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect there to be enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand and/or increased raw material costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control.
Regulation
 
As of the date of this Report, we are required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).

Any such requirements could require us to divert significant human and capital resources on compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this Report, we do not have employees. However our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Information Officer provide part-time consulting services to us without compensation.
