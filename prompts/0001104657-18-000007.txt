Item 1. | BUSINESS

THE COMPANY
Materion Corporation (referred to herein as the Company, our, we, or us), through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is an integrated producer of high-performance advanced engineered materials used in a variety of electrical, electronic, thermal, and structural applications with $1.1 billion in net sales in 2017. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1931 and has approximately 2,700 employees. Our products are sold into numerous end markets, including consumer electronics, industrial components, defense, medical, automotive electronics, telecommunications infrastructure, energy, commercial aerospace, science, services, and appliance. 
SEGMENT INFORMATION
Our businesses are organized under four reportable segments: Performance Alloys and Composites (PAC), Advanced Materials, Precision Coatings, and Other. Our Other reportable segment includes unallocated corporate costs. 
Segment reporting and geographic information relating to net sales, operating profit, and assets is presented in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information regarding our segments and business is presented below.
Performance Alloys and Composites
The Performance Alloys and Composites segment is comprised of the following three reporting units: Performance Alloys, Beryllium & Composites, and Technical Materials.
Performance Alloys is the largest PAC business and produces beryllium and non-beryllium containing alloy products in strip, bulk, and other custom shapes at manufacturing facilities in the United States, Europe, and Asia. This business also operates the world's largest bertrandite ore mine and refinery, which is located in Utah, providing feedstock hydroxide for its beryllium and beryllium alloy businesses and external sales. 

• | Bulk products are the largest of the product families and are made with copper and nickel (with or without beryllium) in plate, rod, bar, tube, and wire product forms and other customized shapes. Depending upon the application, they may provide superior strength, corrosion/wear resistance, thermal conductivity, or lubricity. While the majority of bulk products contain beryllium, a growing portion of net sales is from non-beryllium-containing alloys as a result of product diversification efforts. Applications for bulk products include oil & gas drilling and production components, bearings, bushings, welding rods, plastic mold tooling, and undersea telecommunications housing equipment. Major end markets for bulk products include industrial components, commercial aerospace, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure. Bulk products compete with companies around the world that produce alloys with similar properties. Key competitors include NGK Insulators, IBC Advanced Alloys Corp., Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd., Ulba Metallurgical, Le Bronze Industriel, KME AG & Co. KG, Aurubis AG, MKM Mansfelder Kupfer und Messing GmbH, AMPCO Metal, and Chuetsu Metal Works Ltd. 


• | Strip products include various thicknesses of precision strip. These beryllium and non-beryllium containing alloy products are made with copper and nickel to provide unique combinations of high conductivity, high reliability, and formability for use as connectors, contacts, springs, switches, relays, shielding, and bearings. Major end markets for strip products include consumer electronics, telecommunications infrastructure, automotive electronics, aerospace, industrial components, appliance, and medical. Strip products compete with strip from many companies around the world that produce alloys with similar properties as beryllium and non-beryllium containing alloys. Key competitors include NGK Insulators, Global Brass and Copper, Inc., Wieland Electric, Inc., Aurubis Stolberg GmbH, Diehl Metall Stiftung & Co. KG, Nippon Mining, and PMX Industries, Inc. 

Strip and bulk products are manufactured at facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania and are distributed internationally through a network of company-owned service centers, outside distributors, and agents. 

• | Beryllium hydroxide is produced at our milling operations in Utah from our bertrandite ore mine and purchased beryl ore. The hydroxide is used primarily as a raw material input for strip and bulk products and, to a lesser extent, beryllium products. Net sales of beryllium hydroxide to third parties from our Utah operations were less than 5% of Performance Metals’ total net sales in each of the last three years.

Beryllium & Composites manufactures beryllium, beryllium aluminum, aluminum metal matrix composites (MMCs), beryllia ceramics, and bulk metallic glass materials in rod, plate, bar, strip, and customized shapes. These materials are used in applications th
2

at require high stiffness and/or low density and tend to be premium priced due to their unique combination of properties. Defense and science are the largest end markets for beryllium products, while other end markets served include industrial components, commercial aerospace, medical, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure. Products are also sold for acoustics, optical scanning, and performance automotive applications. While Performance Metals is the only domestic producer of metallic beryllium, it competes primarily with designs utilizing other materials including other lightweight metals, MMCs, and organic composites. Our aluminum powder metal MMCs compete with DWA Aluminum Composites and cast MMCs made by Duralcan USA. Electronic components utilizing beryllia and alumina ceramics are used in the industrial components, medical, defense, telecommunications infrastructure, commercial aerospace, and science end markets. Direct competitors include American Beryllia Inc., CBL Ceramics Limited, and CoorsTek, Inc. Manufacturing facilities for beryllium products are located in Ohio, California, Arizona, and the United Kingdom. The majority of Beryllium product sales are direct but there are also agents and representatives that support worldwide sales.
Technical Materials produces strip metal products with clad inlay and overlay metals, including precious and base metal electroplated systems, electron beam welded systems, contour profiled systems, and solder-coated metal systems. This operating unit is located in Lincoln, Rhode Island. These specialty strip metal products provide a variety of thermal, electrical, or mechanical properties from a surface area or particular section of the material. Our cladding and plating capabilities allow for a precious metal or other base metal to be applied in continuous strip form, only where it is needed, reducing the material cost to the customer as well as providing design flexibility and performance. Major applications for these products include connectors, contacts, power lead frames, and semiconductors, while the largest end markets are automotive electronics and consumer electronics. The energy and medical end markets are smaller but offer further growth opportunities. Technical Materials' products are manufactured at our Lincoln, Rhode Island facility and are sold directly through its sales representatives. Technical Materials' major competitors include Heraeus Inc., AMI Doduco, Inc., and other North American continuous strip and plating companies.
Advanced Materials
Advanced Materials produces advanced chemicals, microelectronics packaging, precious metal, non-precious metal, and specialty metal products, including vapor deposition targets, frame lid assemblies, clad and precious metal pre-forms, high temperature braze materials, and ultra-pure wire. These products are used in semiconductor logic and memory, medical, energy, lighting, defense, optics, and wireless communications applications within the consumer electronics, industrial components, and telecommunications infrastructure end markets. Advanced Materials also has metal recovery operations and in-house refining that allow for the recycling of precious metals.
Advanced Materials products are sold directly from its facilities throughout the United States, Asia, and Europe, as well as through direct sales offices and independent sales representatives throughout the world. Principal competition includes companies such as Eastman Chemical Company, Honeywell International, Inc., Johnson Matthey plc, Praxair, Inc., Solar Applied Materials Technology Corp., Sumitomo Metals Industries, Ltd., and Tanaka Holding Co., Ltd., as well as a number of smaller regional and national suppliers.
The majority of the sales into the consumer electronics end market from this segment are vapor deposition targets, lids, wire, other related precious and non-precious metal products, and advanced chemicals for semiconductors and other microelectronic applications. These materials are used in wireless, light-emitting diode (LED), handheld devices and other applications, as well as in a number of applications within the defense end market. Since we are an up-front material supplier, changes in our consumer electronics sales levels do not necessarily correspond to changes in the end-use consumer demand in the same period due to down-stream inventory positions, the time to develop and deploy new products, and manufacturing lead times and scheduling. While our product and market development efforts allow us to capture new applications, we may lose existing applications and customers from time to time due to the rapid change in technologies and other factors.
Precision Coatings
The Precision Coatings segment includes the following reporting units:
Precision Optics produces sputter-coated precision thin film coatings and optical filter materials. Based in Westford, Massachusetts, the group has manufacturing facilities in the United States and China. 
Large Area Coatings produces high-performance sputter-coated precision flexible thin film materials. Based in Windsor, Connecticut, the business manufactures and distributes coated and converted thin film material solutions primarily for medical testing and diagnosis applications.

Availability of Raw Materials
The principal raw materials we use are aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, and tin. Ore reserve data can be found in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The availability of these raw materials, as well as other materials used by us, is adequate and generally not dependent on any one supplier.
Patents and Licenses
We own patents, patent applications, and licenses relating to certain of our products and processes. While our rights under these patents and licenses are of some importance to our operations, our business is not materially dependent on any one patent or license or on all of our patents and licenses as a group.
Research and Development
Active research and development programs seek new product compositions and designs as well as process innovations. Expenditures for research and development amounted to $14.0 million in 2017 and $12.8 million in both 2016 and 2015. 
Backlog
The backlog of unshipped orders as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $204.0 million, $175.5 million, and $157.0 million, respectively. Backlog is generally represented by purchase orders that may be terminated under certain conditions. We expect that substantially all of our backlog of orders at December 31, 2017 will be filled over the next 18 months.
Acquisitions
On February 28, 2017, the Company acquired the target materials business of the Heraeus Group (HTB), of Hanau, Germany, for an initial purchase price of $16.5 million. This business operates within the Advanced Materials segment and the results of operations are included as of the date of acquisition. Refer to Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the Company's acquisition.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to a variety of laws that regulate the manufacturing, processing, use, handling, storage, transport, treatment, emission, release, and disposal of substances and wastes used or generated in manufacturing. For decades, we have operated our facilities under applicable standards of inplant and outplant emissions and releases. The inhalation of airborne beryllium particulate may present a health hazard to certain individuals.
On January 9, 2017, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published a new standard for workplace exposure to beryllium that, among other things, lowered the permissible exposure by a factor of ten and established new requirements 
4

for respiratory protection, personal protective clothing and equipment, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and record keeping. Other government and standard-setting organizations are also reviewing beryllium-related worker safety rules and standards, and will likely make them more stringent. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect the buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.
