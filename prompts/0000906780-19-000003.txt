Item 1. | Business.

Overview
Empire Resorts, Inc. (“Empire,” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “us,” “our” or “we”) was organized as a Delaware corporation on March 19, 1993 and, since that time, has served as a holding company for various subsidiaries engaged in the hospitality and gaming industries. 
 Our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Montreign Operating Company, LLC, doing business as Resorts World Catskills ("Montreign Operating"), owns and operates Resorts World Catskills, a casino resort (the "Casino"), which is located at the approximately1,700-acre site of a four-season destination resort ("Destination Resort") in Sullivan County, New York, approximately 90 miles from New York City. The Destination Resort in which Resorts World Catskills is located also includes a 101-room lifestyle hotel ("The Alder") adjacent to the Casino. The Alder is owned and operated by Empire Resorts Real Estate II, LLC ("ERREII"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Montreign Operating. Empire Resorts I, LLC ("ERREI"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Montreign Operating, is developing a golf course (the "Golf Course Project" and, together with the Casino and The Alder, the "Development Projects") at the Destination Resort. 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monticello Raceway Management, Inc. ("MRMI"), we own and operate Monticello Casino and Raceway, which began racing operations in 1958 in Monticello, New York, which is proximate to the Casino. Monticello Casino and Raceway currently features a video gaming machine ("VGM") and harness horseracing facility. The Company recently announced that VGM operations and food and beverage service at Monticello Casino and Raceway will cease on or about April 23, 2019. We also generate racing revenues through pari-mutuel wagering on the running of live harness horse races, the import simulcasting of harness and thoroughbred horse races from racetracks across the country and internationally, and the export simulcasting of our races to offsite pari-mutuel wagering facilities.
 Gaming and Resort Operations
Resorts World Catskills
Resorts World Catskills is located in the Town of Thompson, New York which is located in the Catskill region of New York State. The Catskill region has historically been a resort area. The Casino includes an 18-story hotel, casino and entertainment complex featuring more than 2,150 slot machines and 150 live table games, a poker room and private gaming salons. The Casino also offers varied bar and restaurant experiences, which includes an Italian steakhouse created by celebrity chef Scott Conant, and year-round live entertainment at the 2,500-seat RW Epicenter, casino bars and lounges.

The Destination Resort has a dedicated interchange off New York State Route 17 at Exit 106 that delivers guests directly into the Destination Resort. Our casino operations are overseen by the New York State Gaming Commission ("NYSGC"). Gaming at the Casino is permitted 24 hours a day and is limited to persons over the age of 21. Smoking is not permitted in the Casino.

Monticello Casino and Raceway
Monticello Casino and Raceway is a VGM and year-round harness horseracing facility. Monticello Casino and Raceway is approximately three miles away from the Destination Resort, is directly adjacent to New York State Route 17 and has highly visible signage and convenient access from Exit 104 of New York State Route 17. 

VGM Operations
Monticello Casino and Raceway operates VGMs, which includes video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) and electronic table game positions (“ETGs”). VGMs are similar to slot machines, but they are connected to a central system and report financial information to the central system. ETGs include the games of roulette, blackjack and 3-card poker. Monticello Casino and Raceway currently features 1,070 VLTs and 20 ETGs (collectively, 1,090 VGMs) on a 45,000-square foot gaming floor with a separate high stakes VGM area. Monticello Casino and Raceway also has three dining options which include a food court, restaurant and sports bar. 

The VGMs at Monticello Casino and Raceway are owned by New York State and are overseen by the NYSGC. Revenues derived from our VGM operations consist of VGM revenues and food and beverage revenues. Gross VGM revenues consist of the total amount wagered at our VGMs, less prizes awarded. Video lottery gaming is permitted for no more than 20 consecutive hours per day and on no day can such operation be conducted past 6:00 a.m.
The Company recently announced that VGM operations and food and beverage service at Monticello Casino and Raceway will cease on or about April 23, 2019. 
Raceway Operations, Simulcasting and Pari-mutuel Wagering Activities
Raceway operations, which include live harness horseracing, simulcasting and pari-mutuel wagering activities in New York State, are overseen by the NYSGC. In a letter dated February 22, 2019, the NYSGC approved MRMI’s race dates for March and April, 2019. Generally, the annual license renewal process requires the NYSGC to review the financial responsibility, experience, character and general fitness of MRMI and its management.

We derive our racing, simulcasting and pari-mutuel wagering revenue principally from the following:

• | wagering at Monticello Casino and Raceway on live races run at Monticello Casino and Raceway and races broadcast from out-of-state racetracks using import simulcasting;


• | fees from wagering at out-of-state locations and internationally on races run at Monticello Casino and Raceway

using export simulcasting; and 

• | revenue allocations, as prescribed by law, from betting activity at off-track betting facilities in New York State.

Simulcasting is the process by which a live horse race held at one facility (the “host track”) is transmitted to another location that allows patrons of such other location to wager on that race. Amounts wagered at each off-track betting location are combined into the appropriate pools at the host track’s tote facility where the final odds and payouts are determined. With the exception of a few holidays, we offer year-round simulcast wagering from racetracks across the country. In addition, races of national interest such as the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Breeders’ Cup supplement our regular simulcast programming. We also export live broadcasts of our own races to race tracks, casinos and off-track betting facilities in the United States and internationally.
In pari-mutuel wagering, patrons bet against each other rather than against the operator of the facility or with pre-set odds. The amounts wagered form a pool of funds from which winnings are paid based on odds determined by the wagering activity. The racetrack acts as a stakeholder for the wagering patrons and deducts from the amounts wagered a “take-out” or gross commission from which the racetrack pays state and county taxes and racing purses. Our pari-mutuel commission rates are fixed as a percentage of the total handle or amounts wagered.
bet365 Collaboration Agreement
On November 14, 2018 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into a sportsbook and digital gaming collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Hillside (New York) LLC, an affiliate of bet365 Group Limited (“bet365”). Directly and through its affiliates, bet365 operates, owns, controls and manages online gaming and sports betting services throughout the world. The Collaboration Agreement provides the terms and conditions on which bet365 will participate with the Company in the offering of retail sports betting, an online sportsbook, online casino/table games and online poker in New York State, if and when permitted by applicable law (the “bet365 Collaboration”). The initial term of the Collaboration Agreement commenced on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier as described below, will continue in force until the earlier of the (i) 20th anniversary of the date on which the bet365 Gaming Services (as such term is defined below) are first offered to players pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement (the “Go-Live Date”) and (ii) termination of the Company’s Gaming Facility License. The initial term will be extended automatically for successive five-year periods unless a party provides at least 12 months’ written notice of its election not to renew.
Retail Sportsbook Lounge
The Casino is constructing a sportsbook lounge in anticipation of the adoption of regulations promulgated by the NYSGC regarding retail sports betting. Once bet365 receives the required approvals from the NYSGC with respect to the bet365 Collaboration and provides the Company notice, which notice will be provided within 12 months of the Go-Live Date, the operation and management of the sportsbook lounge will transition to bet365, at which point the lounge, originally branded with the Company’s brands, will be rebranded with a bet365 brand. Following the transition, bet365 will design and manage the betting platform, provide trading, odds and price setting and otherwise manage risk and provide marketing and marketing advisory services (the “bet365 Sportsbook Services”). The Company will continue to be responsible for the maintenance and day-to-day operational management of the sportsbook lounge following the transition. The Company will be reimbursed by bet365 for a portion of the build-out costs of the sportsbook lounge and 100% of the costs to operate the lounge prior to the transition, less the gaming revenue derived from the lounge after the payment of applicable gaming taxes prior to the transition (the “Pre-Transition Revenue”). If the Pre-Transition Revenue exceeds the build-out costs, such Pre-Transition Revenue will be shared in accordance with the Revenue Share Waterfall (which term is defined and discussed below). If the Collaboration Revenue (as such term is defined and discussed below) is insufficient to pay the build-out costs, bet365 will reimburse the Company and recover the shortfall payment through the Revenue Share Waterfall.
Online Sportsbook
If New York State enacts laws during the term of the Collaboration Agreement allowing the offering of an online sportsbook, bet365 will manage, control and administer an online sportsbook utilizing the Company’s Gaming Facility License (the “bet365 Online Sportsbook Services”). The online sportsbook will be offered under the bet365 brand. To the extent required by law, the online sportsbook will become branded with a bet365 brand and a Company brand, or branded solely with a Company brand. To the extent New York State allows more than one brand to operate an online gaming platform utilizing the Company’s Gaming 
3

Facility License (each such brand, a “Skin”) and the Company desires to offer additional Skins on the Gaming Facility License, the Company will consult with bet365 in good faith prior to offering additional Skins. The decision to offer additional Skins ultimately will be made by the Company; provided, however, (i) if such additional Skin is added to the Gaming Facility License prior to a specified anniversary of the enactment of New York State gaming laws permitting an online sportsbook (the “Online Enactment Date”), the majority of the Company’s independent directors must approve such decision and (ii) if such additional Skin is added to the Gaming Facility License after a specified anniversary of the Online Enactment Date, such decision must be approved by the Collaboration Committee (which term is defined and discussed below). Depending on whether the additional Skins are Company-branded Skins, offered in connection with a strategic capital investment in the Company or exchanged in return for access to jurisdictions outside New York State, the revenue generated from, and the costs associated with, the additional Skins will be shared by the Company and bet365 in accordance with the terms of the Collaboration Agreement.
Online Casino/Table Games and Online Poker
If New York State enacts laws during the term of the Collaboration Agreement allowing the offering of online casino/table games and/or online poker (the “Online Gaming Services” and, together with the bet365 Online Sportsbook Services, the “bet365 Gaming Services”), the parties will work in good faith and provide each other with reasonable assistance for bet365 to manage, control and administer such Online Gaming Services utilizing the Gaming Facility License. Following the date on which holders of a Gaming Facility License are permitted to provide the online casino/table games and/or online poker in New York State, bet365 will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause the Go-Live Date to occur as soon as possible and (ii) for the Online Gaming Services offered by bet365 to be competitive in New York State. If bet365 uses good faith efforts to launch the Online Gaming Services but is unable to do so, such failure will not be a breach of the Collaboration Agreement and the Company may freely contract with a third party for such Online Gaming Services and the proceeds of such venture will be deemed Collaboration Revenue. The Online Gaming Services will be offered under the bet365 brand. To the extent required by law, the Online Gaming Services will become branded with a bet365 brand and a Company brand, or branded solely with a Company brand. If a Company-branded online sportsbook is offered in New York State, the Company may request that the Company-branded online sportsbook be configured to include the Online Gaming Services, as applicable. To the extent bet365 is successful at offering Online Gaming Services in New York State, the Company will not enter into any arrangement with a third party to offer online casino/table games and/or online poker using the Company brands.
Management of the Collaboration
The parties will form a committee of representatives from each party to approve certain actions relating to the Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Committee”). In addition, the Collaboration Committee will adopt an annual plan covering intended product developments relating to the bet365 Sportsbook Services and bet365 Gaming Services, if any. At all times, the parties have the right to appoint an equal number of members to the Collaboration Committee and each of the Company and bet365 will initially appoint two members each. Unless a member is deemed an unsuitable person for purposes of the gaming laws of New York State, in which case such member will be removed immediately, only a party that appointed a member to the Collaboration Committee may remove such member and appoint a replacement. Each member of the Collaboration Committee is entitled to one vote and any decision to be made by the Collaboration Committee must be approved by the affirmative vote of at least one bet365 member and one Company member then in office. In the event the Collaboration Committee deadlocks on a decision, each party may request a meeting with the senior executives of both parties with the power and authority to resolve such deadlock.
Equity Investment into the Company
In connection with entering into the Collaboration Agreement, Hillside (New Media Holdings) Limited, an affiliate of bet365 ("bet365 Investor"), and the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the “bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which bet365 Investor agreed to purchase up to 2.5 million shares of common stock of the Company at a purchase price of $20.00 per share, for an aggregate investment of $50 million. The terms and conditions of the bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement are discussed below.
After all gaming taxes have been paid and the parties have recouped their costs and expenses from the Collaboration Revenue, bet365 may receive a distribution (the “Preferred Distribution”) equal to 50% of the positive difference, if any (the “delta”), between $20 and the value of the Company’s common stock measured on a given date (such date, the “Trigger Date”), multiplied by the number of shares of common stock then held by bet365 Investor. The Trigger Date is 30 days after the Company’s first filing of an annual or quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission after bet365 recoups its costs incurred pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement. The delta will be the positive difference between $20 and the 30-day volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock on the Trigger Date. If the Company is no longer a reporting company, or if the Company’s common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, the delta will be the positive difference between $20 and the fair market value of the Company’s common stock as determined by an investment bank retained by the parties. If a change 
4

of control (as such term is defined in the Collaboration Agreement) of the Company occurs before the Trigger Date, the delta will be the positive difference between $20 and the per share value paid by a third party in a change of control transaction. The Preferred Distribution, if any, will be payable on a monthly basis over a period of three years (each such payment, a “Monthly Preferred Distribution”). If bet365 Investor sells any shares of common stock prior to the Trigger Date, the Preferred Distribution will be deemed to be $0.
Funding of Collaboration Costs and Distribution of Collaboration Revenue
Following the transition and the Go-Live Date, all costs associated with the bet365 Sportsbook Services and the bet365 Gaming Services, as applicable, will be funded out of the revenue generated pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Revenue”). If the Collaboration Revenue is insufficient to cover the costs incurred under the Collaboration Agreement, bet365 will reimburse such costs and the shortfall will recouped by bet365 from future Collaboration Revenue.

The Collaboration Revenue will be distributed 50% to the Company and 50% to bet365 on a monthly basis according to a distribution waterfall (the “Revenue Share Waterfall”) set forth in the Collaboration Agreement, which sequentially will be distributed as follows: (i) all gaming taxes relating to the services provided pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement; (ii) costs incurred by the Company and then bet365 pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement; (iii) to bet365 until bet365 has recovered all investment costs incurred prior to the lounge or the Go-Live Date; (iv) Monthly Preferred Distribution to bet365, if any; (v) to bet365 to recoup agreed-upon gaming revenue shortfalls and capital investment catch-ups in the event there are additional Skins; and (vi) finally, 50% of the remaining Collaboration Revenue to each of the Company and bet365.
Gaming Approvals; Special Termination Right of bet365
Following the Effective Date, the Company and bet365 will engage in advocacy efforts in the New York State to permit the transactions contemplated by the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, following the Effective Date, bet365 will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the NYSGC approval required to own the equity of the Company. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist bet365 in obtaining such approval. In addition, if the New York State enacts regulations and/or laws during the term allowing the various transactions contemplated by the Collaboration Agreement, the parties agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary approvals to enable the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Collaboration Agreement. To the extent required by the applicable gaming laws, the Company will be responsible for the regulatory oversight related to the arrangement with bet365.
Following the enactment of the regulations and/or laws necessary to enable the offering of the bet365 Sportsbook Services and/or the bet365 Gaming Services, the parties will monitor and assess such applicable gaming laws that affect the transactions contemplated by the Collaboration Agreement. To the extent that bet365 has a good faith concern that, as a result of provisions of the applicable gaming regulations and/or laws, the obligations of bet365 under the Collaboration Agreement will not be commercially viable, then the parties will discuss in good faith and engage in advocacy efforts to modify the applicable gaming laws. To the extent following such discussions or advocacy efforts, if in bet365’s good faith opinion it will not be commercially viable to operate the bet365 Gaming Services, bet365 can terminate the Collaboration Agreement. However, following such a termination, neither bet365 nor any affiliate may offer online gaming services in New York State for a period of 18 months.
Termination
The term of the Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by the mutual agreement of the parties. In addition, either party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement upon written notice (i) if New York State fails to enact laws authorizing an online sportsbook by certain agreed-upon dates, (ii) subject to notice and cure requirements, upon a material breach of the Collaboration Agreement, (iii) if the other party is deemed an unsuitable person under the applicable gaming laws and the issues cannot be remedied after commercially reasonable efforts, (iv) in the event the other party is bankrupt, (v) the NYSGC disapproves of the Collaboration Agreement and the parties are unable to amend the Collaboration Agreement without materially detrimentally frustrating the commercial intent of the parties, (vi) if a law is passed by New York State prohibiting an online sportsbook, (vii) if a federal law preempts the gaming laws of New York State such that the operation of an online sportsbook does not require a state license, or (viii) upon a change in control of the other party to a third party that is deemed to be a Highly Competitive Business (as such term is defined in the Collaboration Agreement) to such terminating party.
Guaranty and Offset
In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, bet365 Group Limited delivered to the Company a letter (the “Guaranty”) guarantying the payment obligations and indemnification obligations of bet365 under the Collaboration Agreement. The Guaranty 
5

will terminate upon the fifth anniversary of the date on which the parties begin receiving a share of the profits of the arrangement pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement.
If a notice of material breach of the Collaboration Agreement is delivered from one party to the other after the Guaranty terminates, a portion of the profit share received by the breaching party from the Collaboration Revenue will be held and not used or otherwise distributed to such party’s equity holders until the breach is cured. In addition, the non-breaching party can withhold any profit share it owes to the breaching party until the earlier of (i) the agreed-upon hold-back value is attained or (ii) the breaching party cures the breach.
General
Each party granted to the other (in the case of the Company to bet365, subject to the terms of applicable license agreement of the Company and its subsidiaries) a worldwide, revocable, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use the intellectual property brands owned or licensed by the granting party in connection with the retail and online sportsbook, online casino/table games and online poker. The customer data obtained through the operation of the retail and online betting and gaming services and the Company's customer loyalty program will be jointly owned by bet365 and the Company.
The Company agreed to indemnify bet365 and its affiliates against liabilities arising out of third party claims relating to the operation of the Casino, a breach of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company under the Collaboration Agreement, the intellectual property of the Company, any violation of law or failure to pay applicable gaming taxes by the Company, the cancellation or suspension of the NYSGC approvals obtained by bet365 due to the act or omission of the Company and any claims relating to a data breach in which data in the possession of the Company is accessed in an unauthorized manner. bet365 agreed to indemnify the Company and its affiliates against liabilities arising out of third-party claims relating to a breach of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company under the Collaboration Agreement, the intellectual property of bet365, any violation of law or failure to pay applicable gaming taxes by bet365, the cancellation or suspension of the NYSGC approvals obtained by the Company due to the act or omission of bet365 and any claims relating to a data breach in which data in the possession of bet365 is accessed in an unauthorized manner.
The Collaboration Agreement contains further agreements of the parties concerning, among other things, confidentiality, non-solicitation of employees, and cross-promotion of the sportsbook lounge and the bet365 Gaming Services. In addition, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Resorts World Casino New York City to provide marketing support for the bet365 Gaming Services and to provide registration or management facilities or wager terminals at Resorts World Casino New York City if permissible under applicable gaming laws and requested by bet365. The transaction contemplated by the Collaboration Agreement, as well as the suitability of bet365 and bet365 Investor, are subject to the approval of the NYSGC. 
bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement
In connection with entering into the Collaboration Agreement, bet365 Investor and the Company entered into the bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which bet365 Investor agreed to purchase up to 2.5 million shares of common stock of the Company at $20 per share. In accordance with the bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement, the bet365 Investor purchased 1,685,759 shares of common stock upon execution of the bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement. The purchase of these shares was subject to, among other things, evidence of a commitment by Kien Huat Realty III Limited to invest up to $126 million of equity financing into the Company and further evidence that $12 million of such commitment was funded. Following the closing, bet365 Investor and the Company agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents from the NYSGC for bet365 Investor’s ownership of the equity interests of the Company. The offer and sale of these shares was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-214119), which became effective on November 17, 2016, pursuant to a base prospectus dated as of November 17, 2016 contained in such registration statement and a prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 14, 2018. The Company received net proceeds of $33.7 million from the offering.
Pursuant to the bet 365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement, the bet365 Investor will be obligated to purchase the remaining 814,241 shares of common stock at $20.00 per share so long as the following closing conditions are met: (i) 30 days have passed following the receipt of approval from the NYSGC of bet365 Investor’s ownership of the Shares and the enactment of laws by New York State allowing the offering of the bet365 Online Sportsbook Services; (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company are true and correct in all material respects and the Company has complied with its obligations under the bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement; (iii) the Collaboration Agreement is in full force and effect and there is no material breach of the Collaboration Agreement by the Company outstanding; (iv) the common stock of the Company continues to be listed on The 
6

Nasdaq Stock Market; (v) the Company continues to own 100% of the equity interests in the Casino; and (vi) the Gaming Facility License is still valid.
If the remaining shares are issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or if the bet365 Investor is deemed an affiliate of the Company following the issuance of such shares, the bet365 Investor will have certain demand resale registration rights with respect to such shares.
The bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the closing on the remaining shares upon mutual consent of the Company and the bet365 Investor. Additionally, either the Company or the bet365 Investor may terminate the bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement if the NYSGC issues an order prohibiting such closing if such order did not result from the terminating party’s breach of the bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement. Additionally, either the Company or the bet365 Investor may unilaterally terminate the bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement if the bet365 Investor or the Company, as applicable, is in material breach of the bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement that is not cured and the non-breaching party is then in compliance. The bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement will terminate automatically if the Collaboration Agreement is terminated prior to the closing on the remaining shares or if the NYSGC denies the Company’s request to approve the bet365 Investor’s ownership of such shares.
Marketing
     Our marketing efforts are conducted through various channels. These channels include radio, television, print, outdoor and digital throughout the Hudson-Valley Catskill region and the larger New York City metropolitan area. Our more targeted marketing efforts are conducted through direct mail and email. We maintain websites to inform individuals and potential customers about Resorts World Catskills and Monticello Casino and Raceway and utilize several social media sites to promote our brands, unique events and special deals. Further, our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that identify patron preferences to allow us to make more relevant offers to patrons, influence incremental visits, and help build lasting patron relationships. 
Resorts World Catskills
The Casino receives patronage from adults residing within the metropolitan New York City area, including New York City, northern and northwestern suburbs of New York City, northern New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania. The Casino has an overall drive-time advantage relative to other full-scale gaming facilities from the northern and northwestern suburbs of New York City and the Company is focused on servicing what we believe is an unmet demand in the New York metropolitan market. 
The Casino has a range of high-end offerings, including 600 square-foot hotel suites, private gaming salons, poolside townhouse villas and garden suites and a VIP reception area and players’ lounge with private elevator, which are designed to appeal to higher-end gaming patrons in the market. The Casino and The Alder are integrated into the master-planned Destination Resort, which will feature a range of year-round amenities, including an indoor waterpark (the "Indoor Waterpark") for which subsidiaries of EPR Properties, a party unrelated to the Company, are responsible for developing, and the Golf Course Project. The Casino is also convenient to recreational offerings in the Catskill Mountains. The Indoor Waterpark together with the Development Project, are referred to herein as "Initial Projects". 
We leverage the Resorts World brand, which is a well-known hospitality brand in the Asian markets, to target the large regional Asian gaming market and high-end Asian players. The Casino offers various Asian-themed amenities, including table games and slot machines, an Asian gaming pit, high-end gaming and private gaming salons, and various authentic Asian food options.

We have a patron loyalty program to encourage patron relationships with Resorts World Catskills and increase loyalty to the Resorts World brand through unique benefits and rewards, while promoting our brand. When expanded, the patron loyalty program will include a rewards program that will allow patrons to qualify for benefits at participating Resorts World-branded resorts and in both gaming and non-gaming areas. Members may earn points for their gaming play which can be redeemed at participating properties. Information from the loyalty and rewards programs is used to analyze patron usage and preferences by segment and individual player profile.
Monticello Casino and Raceway
Monticello Casino and Raceway receives patronage from adults residing within the surrounding counties of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The average drive-time of our current patrons is up to 60 minutes and therefore we focus on a convenience gaming market.
7

Monticello Casino and Raceway's mid-range offerings include gaming and dining options designed to appeal to locals and patrons interested in a more intimate and comfortable setting. Our Players' Club enables patrons to earn points that can be used for free slot play, complimentary food, merchandise, special offers, promotions, VIP invitations, discounts and coupons. The Players' Club also enables patrons to earn points when wagering on racing at Monticello Casino and Raceway.
Seasonality
The gaming market in the northeastern United States is seasonal in nature. Peak gaming activities occur during the months of May through September. Although winter weather may affect our patrons' ability to reach our facilities, we expect that the availability of the overnight accommodations at the Casino and The Alder will mitigate the adverse affects of winter weather on our gaming operations.
Competition
The casino entertainment industry is highly competitive. The industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies, and financial condition. Generally, we compete directly with casino and VGM facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas. Due to the geographic proximity, the Casino and Monticello Casino and Raceway may compete, in part, with each other for gaming patrons. The Casino competes with other gaming and non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, various other entertainment businesses, and also competes with other retail facilities, amusement attractions, food and beverage offerings, and entertainment venues.
In addition to competition from traditional gaming facilities, which is discussed in more detail below, the Casino and Monticello Casino and Raceway face competition from existing and prospective Internet gaming operations and sports wagering. New Jersey law permits Atlantic City casinos to conduct Internet gaming by accepting wagers from individuals who are physically present in New Jersey. Several New Jersey casinos and racetracks have sports wagering lounges and offer online sports pools. Additionally, mobile gaming is permitted in any area located within the property boundaries of a casino hotel facility, including any recreation or swimming pool and excluding parking garages and parking areas. Further, New Jersey law permits racetrack patrons to place bets on live or simulcast racing while they are on racetrack property, including the restaurants and outdoor areas, such as the paddock. New Jersey gaming regulations also authorized skill-based gaming options that appeal to a new generation of players. In October 2017, Pennsylvania signed into law new legislation also authorizes interactive gaming in the form of Internet gaming and up to five video gaming terminals at qualified truck stops. Further, several Pennsylvania casinos have begun to offer sports wagering. 
A number of other states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation to specifically authorize Internet poker and Internet gambling. New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware entered into an agreement which allows Internet poker operators to pool players with partner sites in those states. New York legislators have introduced bills related to Internet gaming and Internet poker. Additionally, two state lotteries offer (and other state lotteries are considering offering) Internet instant game sales to in-state lottery customers and a number of other states, including New York, allow subscription sales of lottery draw games over the Internet. We are unable to determine whether and which, if any, additional legislation will be enacted and what effect it would have on our current operations. 
In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, which had prohibited states from authorizing sports wagering. As a result, certain states, including New York, have adopted or are considering adopting legislation to legalize sports betting. The NYSGC recently authorized the proposal of rules and regulations that would enable sports wagering to be offered at four commercial casinos in New York State, including the Casino. The proposed rules and regulations will enter a 60-day public comment period following the publication in the New York State Register before they become effective and the NYSGC can give final approval. The Casino is preparing to be able to offer sports wagering if and when it is permitted under the regulations. 
We expect Internet gaming and sports wagering to continue to be the topic of additional legislation, including the expansion of legalization efforts within New York State to venues other than holders of Gaming Facility Licenses. We are unable to determine whether and which, if any, legislation will be enacted and what effect it will have on our operations and our prospects. 
Resorts World Catskills

We face competition in and from the northeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut gaming markets in marketing to and attracting patrons from the New York City metropolitan area. Pennsylvania casinos are the competitors located closest to

our Casino. Pennsylvania casinos operate table games and slot machines, grant casino credit and have access to unlimited non-taxable free play. The competing Pennsylvania facilities include the following: Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, located approximately 95 miles southwest of Monticello; Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, approximately 70 miles southwest of Monticello; and Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, located approximately 95 miles southwest of Monticello. In addition, in October 2017, Pennsylvania signed into law new legislation that authorized a number of gaming expansion opportunities. The legislation authorized up to 10 new casino satellite facilities, which would operate between 300 to 750 slot machines and up to 50 table games each. Licenses for these new facilities are awarded through an auction process that began in January 2018. This legislation also authorizes interactive gaming in the form of Internet gaming and up to five video gaming terminals at qualified truck stops. The legislation additionally authorizes fantasy sports wagering and sports wagering. New York State has regulatory limitations on the amount of taxable free play that may be offered to patrons. This could impact our competitiveness as compared to casinos in neighboring jurisdictions. 
In addition to facing potential competition from the casinos in Atlantic City, legislators in New Jersey have reviewed options to expand gaming to various locations in northern New Jersey which could increase competition. Although New Jersey voters previously defeated a referendum in November 2016 to amend the New Jersey State Constitution to permit two casinos in northern New Jersey, another referendum could be introduced in the future. Currently, two of the northern New Jersey racetracks offer online sports wagering. We are unable to predict the impact additional gaming opportunities in northern New Jersey will have on our operations. 
We face competition from Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino, both of which are located on tribal reservations in Connecticut, and from certain VGM facilities in New York State, including VGM facilities located at Yonkers Raceway and Aqueduct Racetrack, both of which are within the New York City metropolitan area.
Further, we also face potential competition from the current or future expansion of state-licensed and tribal gaming in the northeastern United States. Commercial casino gaming has expanded in the northeastern United States and is poised to expand further. These expansions, many of which are convenience gaming facilities as opposed to destination gaming facilities, may affect our revenues.
Monticello Casino and Raceway
In New York State, we face competition for our VGM guests from Orange, Dutchess and Ulster counties in New York and from a VGM facility at Yonkers Raceway. To a lesser extent, Monticello Casino and Raceway faces competition from the Pennsylvania casinos, Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs and Mount Airy Casino Resort, which are discussed above.
Generally, Monticello Casino and Raceway does not compete directly with other harness racing tracks in New York State for live racing patrons. However, Monticello Casino and Raceway does face intense competition for off-track and other legalized wagering at numerous gaming sites within New York State and the surrounding region. The inability to compete with larger purses for the races at Monticello Casino and Raceway and the limitation on other forms of legalized wagering that Monticello Casino and Raceway may offer has been a significant limitation on our ability to compete for off-track and other legalized wagering revenues.
Development
Development Project Expenditures
The Company currently expects the Development Projects, when completed, will cost an aggregate of approximately $928 million, which includes $765 million of anticipated costs for construction of the Development Projects, $68 million for interest expenses, $51 million for the Gaming Facility License fee and $44 million of original issue discount and financing and legal fees. The Company began construction of The Alder in March 2018 after signing a guaranteed maximum price agreement with its construction manager, which was amended to $35.2 million in December 2018. During the fall of 2018, the Company signed a contractor agreement for the Golf Course Project for a total cost of approximately $21.2 million.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred an aggregate total of $867.3 million related to the Development Projects, including $704.7 million of capitalized Development Projects costs, of which approximately $699.0 million was reclassified to property and equipment upon the opening of the Casino and The Alder, $67.6 million of interest expense related to bank debt for the Development Projects, $51.0 million for the Gaming Facility License and incurred $44.0 million of debt issuance costs related to the Development Projects.

The Golf Course Project 
In addition to the Casino and The Alder, the Company is constructing the Golf Course Project at the site of the Destination Resort and anticipates that the Golf Course Project will open for play in Summer 2019. ERREI entered into a standard contractor agreement for the construction of the Golf Course Project, at a cost of approximately $21.2 million. The Company began construction in September 2018 and anticipates the golf course will be open for play during Summer 2019.
Master Development Agreement and Completion Guaranties
On December 28, 2015, Montreign Operating, ERREI and ERREII (together, the "Project Parties"), on the one hand, and EPT Concord II, LLC ("EPT"), EPR Concord II, L.P. ("EPR LP") and Adelaar Developer, LLC, wholly-owned subsidiaries of EPR Properties (the “Destination Resort Developer,” together with EPT and EPR LP collectively, “EPR”), on the other hand, entered into an Amended and Restated Master Development Agreement (as amended, the “MDA”), which amends and restates that certain master development agreement by and between EPT and MRMI originally executed on December 14, 2012. The MDA defines and governs the overall relationship between EPR and the Project Parties with respect to the development, construction, operation, management and disposition of the Initial Projects.
In accordance with the terms of the MDA, EPR is responsible for the development and construction of the Indoor Waterpark and the common infrastructure-related improvements (such as streets, sidewalks, sanitary and storm sewer lines, water, gas, electric, telephone and other utility lines, systems, conduits and other similar facilities) for the Destination Resort. EPR has agreed to make a minimum capital investment of $120 million with respect to the Indoor Waterpark and the infrastructure for the Destination Resort. On December 28, 2015, EPR Properties, a real estate investment trust and the parent company of EPR, entered into a completion guaranty, guaranteeing completion of the development and construction obligations of EPR described in this paragraph.
Neither party has the right to terminate the MDA unless Montreign Operating fails to exercise the Purchase Option (as defined below) prior to its expiration in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Purchase Option Agreement (as defined below).
On January 24, 2017, the MDA was amended to (a) reflect that EPR has secured bond financing in connection with its infrastructure development obligations and (b) account for increases in the common infrastructure budget (and corresponding increases in Empire’s common infrastructure cap amount) in connection with the development of additional roads and increase in the budgeted amounts for New York State electric and gas costs. EPR financed the costs of the infrastructure by the issuance of tax-exempt bonds by a local development corporation. The debt service for these infrastructure bonds will be funded through special district tax assessments, a portion of which will be allocated to each of the parcels on which the Initial Projects are being built. EPR and the Project Parties have agreed to a capped dollar amount on the special district tax assessment for each of the parcels on which the Development Projects are being built, above which the Project Parties will not be responsible. The changes to Empire’s common infrastructure cap amount were also reflected in each of the amendments to the casino lease (the "Casino Lease"), the golf course lease (the "Golf Course Lease") and the lease for The Alder (the "Alder Lease"). 
Intellectual Property
RWS License Agreement
On March 31, 2017, Montreign Operating entered into a license agreement (the “RWS License Agreement”) with RW Services Pte Ltd (“RWS”). RWS is an affiliate of Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay, who is a beneficiary of and controls Kien Huat Realty III Limited ("Kien Huat"), Empire's largest stockholder. Pursuant to the RWS License Agreement, RWS granted Montreign Operating the non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and limited right to use certain “Genting” and “Resorts World” trademarks (the “RWS Licensed Marks”) in connection with the development, marketing, sales, management and operation (the “Permitted Uses”) of the Development Projects. The right to use the RWS Licensed Marks may be assigned or sublicensed only in certain limited circumstances. Because any use of the RWS Licensed Marks for a purpose other than the Permitted Uses will require the prior written consent of RWS, the Company will seek approval to use the RWS Licensed Marks in conjunction with the bet365 Collaboration. The name of the Casino is “Resorts World Catskills,” and, notwithstanding the foregoing, the use of such name is exclusive to Montreign Operating and may be used in connection with online gaming in addition to the Permitted Uses.
The initial term of the RWS License Agreement will expire on December 31, 2027, and will be extended automatically for additional terms of 12 months each, up to a maximum of 39 additional terms, unless either of the parties provides notice to terminate the RWS License Agreement or upon the mutual written consent of both parties. Montreign Operating’s rights and obligations under the RWS License Agreement are subject to and governed by the rules and regulations applicable to Montreign Operating’s 
10

gaming operations at the Casino, and the fiduciary obligations of the boards of directors of Montreign Operating and Empire, as well as the fiduciary obligations of Kien Huat. Beginning on the date on which the Casino opened to the public, Montreign Operating pays to RWS a fee equivalent to a percentage of Net Revenue (as such term is defined in the RWS License Agreement) generated in each calendar year from (i) all activity at the Casino, (ii) each specific use of the RWS Licensed Marks in The Alder or Golf Course and (iii) each specific use of the name Resorts World Catskills in connection with on-line gaming. The percentage of Net Revenue payable as the fee is a low single digit percentage that will increase incrementally between the third year and sixth year of the term of the RWS License Agreement and will remain a low single digit percentage during the entire term of the RWS License Agreement. The Company incurred an expense of approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting the fee payable pursuant to the RWS License Agreement.
During the term of the RWS License Agreement, Montreign Operating may participate in the Genting Rewards Alliance loyalty program (the “Alliance”), which would provide central marketing and cross-promotion opportunities for the Development Projects with other members of the Alliance. Montreign Operating’s participation in the Alliance is subject to the provisions of a separate agreement, which is currently being negotiated by the parties.
Trademarks
Our principal intellectual property consists of trademarks for Montreign Operating and Monticello Casino and Raceway and includes the license agreement to use the RWS Licensed Marks. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties, venues and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed will attract patrons to our facilities. It is our intent to pursue and maintain the trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our rights.
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,756 full-time and 100 part-time employees. We had collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 1,400 of our employees as of December 31, 2018. We consider our employee relations to be good.
On January 23, 2019, the Company notified employees of MRMI concerning the Company’s plans to cease VGM operations and food and beverage service at Monticello Casino and Raceway. The Company anticipates these operations to cease on or about April 23, 2019. All affected employees of MRMI have been offered a severance package or a position with Montreign Operating.
Regulation and Licensing
The gaming industry is highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. The Casino and Monticello Casino and Raceway are subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of New York State. These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the conduct of operations as well as the responsibility, financial stability, and character of the facilities, owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Individuals and entities, including investors and vendors conducting business with us, must file license/registration applications with the NYSGC, and in some instances must submit to background investigations by the New York State Police in order to prove suitability for licensure/registration. Application, fingerprinting and investigative fees must be paid by us or by the individual or entity seeking licensure or registration. Failure to obtain and maintain a license or registration, as applicable, could require us to sever our relationship with such individuals and/or entities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations . 
Our businesses are also subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, construction, land use, and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and federal anti-money laundering ("AML") laws, as further discussed below. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operations . 
11

Gaming Act and Gaming Facility License
The operations of the Casino are subject to regulation by the NYSGC, Division of Gaming. The Upstate New York Gaming and Economic Development Act ("Gaming Act") provides, among other things, the statutory framework for the regulation of full-scale casino gaming. The Gaming Act authorized the NYSGC to award up to four Gaming Facility Licenses. Effective March 1, 2016, the NYSGC awarded Montreign Operating the sole Gaming Facility License in the Hudson Valley-Catskills region, which consists of Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Sullivan and Ulster counties in New York State. The Gaming Facility License has an initial duration of 10 years from March 1, 2016 and will be renewable thereafter for a period of at least an additional 10 years, as determined by the NYSGC. The NYSGC also awarded one Gaming Facility License in the Albany region and two Gaming Facility Licenses in the eastern Southern Tier/Finger Lakes region. The Gaming Act provides that no casinos will be authorized in Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens or Richmond counties. New York State may, however, legislatively authorize additional Gaming Facility Licenses.
The Gaming Act provides for a seven-year exclusivity period for holders of Gaming Facility Licenses, commencing March 1, 2016, during which no further Gaming Facilities can be licensed by the NYSGC without legislative action. If the New York State legislature authorizes additional Gaming Facility Licenses within this exclusivity period, holders of the original four Gaming Facility Licenses will have the right to recover a pro rata portion of the license fee paid. 
The Gaming Act imposes a $500 annual fee on each slot machine and table game. The tax rate on slot machines at the Casino is 39% and the tax rate on table games is 10%. Although free play allowances are not established by the Gaming Act, the NYSGC has promulgated a regulation that limits non-taxable free play, although the NYSGC may, at its discretion, authorize deviations from these limitations. 
    
VGM and Racing Operations
Our VGM, harness horseracing and simulcast activities in New York State are overseen by the NYSGC, Division of Lottery and Division of Horse Racing and Pari-Mutuel Wagering, respectively. The NYSGC has the authority and responsibility to promulgate rules and regulations that affect the operations of our business. In a letter dated February 22, 2019, the NYSGC approved MRMI’s race dates for March and April, 2019. Generally, the annual license renewal process requires the NYSGC to review the financial responsibility, experience, character and general fitness of MRMI and its management.
We generate revenue from our VGM operations by receiving a commission on the gross revenue generated by the VGMs. The rate of this commission is set by statute. From April 1, 2008 until March 31, 2018, the statute provided that 41% of gross VGM revenue be distributed to us as a commission. Effective as of April 1, 2018, the statute reduced the commission rate to 39% of gross VGM revenue. However, with the arrival of casinos into the regions in which VGM facilities are currently operating in New York State, the Gaming Act provides that the commission payable to VGM facilities will be increased over the statutory amount and equalized to the blended tax rate payable by holders of Gaming Facilities Licenses with respect to gross gaming revenue generated on table games and slot machines. Accordingly, we expect the commission we receive on our VGM operations for the period following the opening of the Casino will equal the blended tax rate on the Casino's gross gaming revenue, which is calculated based on the Casino's gross gaming revenue divided by the actual taxes paid at the Casino. The actual blended tax rate is calculated for the period matching the fiscal year of New York State, which runs from April 1 of the current year to March 31 of the following calendar year. There is also a marketing allowance for racetracks operating video lottery programs of 10% on the first $100 million of net revenues generated and 8% thereafter. In addition, the statute provides for subsidized free play allowance of 15%.
The Gaming Act includes provisions intended to minimize the impact on horsemen of declining revenue at VGM facilities as a result of the introduction of casinos into the region. If VGM facilities are unable to maintain required purse support payments to horsemen at licensed racetracks in amounts equal to at least the 2013 payment amounts, as adjusted for the consumer price index, the holder of a Gaming Facility License in the region in which the licensed racetrack is located is required to make whole the deficit. Accordingly, if the purse support payments from Monticello Casino and Raceway to the horsemen are below the dollar levels realized in 2013, then the Casino must make whole the deficit.
Sports Wagering and Online Gaming
The Gaming Act provides, among other things, that sports betting at the gaming facilities such as the Casino is unlawful unless there has been a change in federal law authorizing such activity or upon ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction that such activity is lawful. In May 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, which effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide, was unconstitutional. Therefore, upon the enactment of relevant regulations by the NYSGC, the Company may implement sports betting as part of the gaming experience at the Casino. In addition, if New York State enacts laws during the Term of the Collaboration Agreement allowing the offering of the bet365 
12

Online Gaming Services, the Company may participate with bet365 in offering online sports betting and online casino games. We can provide no assurance that the NYSGC will enact such regulations enabling the bet365 Sportsbook Services, New York State will legalize the bet365 Gaming Services or such regulations and legislation will be enacted during the Term of the Collaboration Agreement. 
Anti-Money Laundering Laws
            The operations of the Casino and Monticello Casino and Raceway are subject to federal AML laws. The AML laws relate to the reporting of large cash transactions and suspicious activity and include screening transactions against lists maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control in order to prevent the processing of transactions to or from certain countries, individuals, nationals and entities. Our AML policy was developed by applying a risk-based approach and is tailored to our business activities and patron risk profiles. The risk assessment will be updated and revised to reflect changes in our business to ensure sufficiency and effectiveness of our AML policy. Failure to comply with the AML laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties.
