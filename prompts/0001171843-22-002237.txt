Overview
 
We operate in four primary business areas: first, the application of artificial intelligence (“AI”) in our precision medicine business, to provide AI-driven predictive models of tumor drug response to improve clinical outcomes for patients and to assist pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and biotech industries in the development of new personalized drugs and diagnostics; second, creation and development of tumor-specific 3D cell culture models driving accurate prediction of clinical outcomes; third, contract services and research focused on solubility improvements, stability studies, and protein production, and; fourth, production of the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)-cleared STREAMWAY® System for automated, direct-to-drain medical fluid disposal and associated products.
 
We have four reportable segments: Helomics®, zPREDICTA®, SolubleTM and Skyline®. The Helomics segment includes clinical testing and contract research services that include the application of AI. Our zPREDICTA, Inc. (“zPREDICTA”) segment, which was effective upon the closing of the acquisition of zPREDICTA on November 24, 2021, specializes in organ-specific disease models that provide 3D reconstruction of human tissues accurately representing each disease state and mimicking drug response enabling accurate testing of anticancer agents. Our Soluble segment provides services using a self-contained, automated system that conducts high-throughput, self-interaction chromatography screens, using additives and excipients commonly included in protein formulations resulting in soluble and physically stable formulations for biologics. Our Skyline segment consists of the STREAMWAY System product sales, and our TumorGenesis® subsidiary (Research and Development) is included within corporate. Going forward, we have determined that we will focus our resources on the Helomics and zPREDICTA segments and our primary mission statements to accelerate patient-centric drug discovery to improve patient outcomes in cancer treatment, harnessing the power of AI, and to develop tumor-specific 3D cell culture models that provide accurate 3D reconstruction of human tissues representing each cancer disease state.
 
On November 24, 2021, we acquired zPREDICTA in a merger transaction, and at that time we identified zPREDICTA as a reportable segment. zPREDICTA’s business, which involves integration of organ-specific cellular and extracellular elements into 3D cell culture models for in vitro cancer drug testing, represents a unique segment in the Predictive offerings.
 
HELOMICS
 
Our precision medicine business, conducted in our Helomics division, is committed to improving the effectiveness of cancer therapy using our proprietary, multi-omic tumor profiling platform, a one-of-a-kind database of historical tumor data, and the power of AI to build predictive models of tumor drug response.
 
    4 

  

Helomics’ mission is to improve clinical outcomes for patients by partnering with pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and academic organizations to bring innovative clinical products and technologies to the marketplace. Our Patient-centric Drug Discovery using Active Learning asset (“PeDAL”™) is a unique technology that combines our proprietary, clinically validated patient tumor cell line assay (“TruTumor”™), a vast knowledgebase of proprietary and public data together (“TumorSpace”™) with active learning - the active learning allowing the efficient exploration of compound drug responses against a large diverse patient “space”. PeDAL offers researchers the opportunity to efficiently and cost-effectively bring patient diversity much earlier in the drug discovery process. PeDAL works by iterative cycles of active-learning powered Learn-Predict-Test to guide the testing of patient-specific compound responses using the TruTumor assay and patient cell lines to build a comprehensive predictive model of patient responses to compounds. This predictive model can then be used to rank compounds by the fraction of patients of certain profiles that respond as well as the set of compounds that provide the best coverage across patients. PeDAL will be used in fee-for-service projects with pharmaceutical companies.
 
Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) and AI-Driven Business
 
We believe leveraging our unique, historical database of the drug responses of over 150,000 patient tumors to build AI and data-driven multi-omic predictive models of tumor drug response and outcome will provide actionable insights critical to both new drug development and individualizing patient treatment. Through the course of over 15 years of clinical testing of the responses of patient tumors to drugs, Helomics has amassed a huge proprietary knowledgebase of 150,000 patient cases. This data has been rigorously de-identified and aggregated to build a unique, proprietary model of tumor drug response that we call TumorSpace. The TumorSpace model and its data provide a priori knowledge for the machine learning approaches we employ as part of the PeDAL approach.
 TumorSpace model provides a significant competitive advantage to our business offerings. PeDAL's unique patient and tumor-centric AI-driven approach can rapidly and cost-effectively screen hundreds of compounds in thousands of tumor cell lines, and gain valuable information about off-target effects and deliver:
 

● | A ranked list of drug candidates by responsiveness 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Sets of drug candidates that provide maximum patient coverage 
● | Biomarker profiles of patients that respond to specific drug candidates

 
PeDAL also can deliver drug candidates targeted at a specific patient profile as early as the hit-to-lead stage of discovery, significantly increasing the chance of clinical success, leading to a dramatic improvement in both the success, time, and cost of your oncology discovery programs. The AI-driven models will also provide clinical decision support to help oncologists individualize treatment.
 
Our CRO/AI business leverages our core competence in profiling the drug response of patient tumors. Our large knowledgebase of tumor drug response and other data, together with proven AI, has created a unique capability for oncology drug discovery that allows for the highly efficient screening of drug responses from thousands of diverse, well-characterized patient primary tumor cell lines. This novel disruptive patient-centric approach is ideally suited to the early part of drug discovery (especially hit-to-lead, lead optimization, and pre-clinical), resulting in better prioritization of compounds and better coverage of patient diversity. This will dramatically improve the chances of successfully translating discoveries, resulting in lowered costs, shortened timelines, and most importantly enhanced “speed-to-patient” for new therapies.
 
Our CRO services business applies PeDAL to address a range of needs from discovery through clinical and translational research, to clinical trials and diagnostic development and validation as noted below:
 

Research 
-----------
 | ● | Biomarker discovery 
 | ● | Drug discovery 
 | ● | Drug-repurposing 
Development
 | ● | Patient enrichment & selection for trials
 | ● | Clinical trial optimization 
 | ● | Adaptive trials 

 
    5 

  


Clinical Decision Support
-------------------------
 | ● | Patient stratification
 | ● | Treatment selection 

 
We believe this market segment has significant growth potential and we believe we are differentiated from traditional CRO’s and other precision medicine and AI companies through these unique assets:
 

● | Clinically validated TruTumor platform; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | TumorSpace model of over 150,000 tumor cases; 
● | Experienced AI team and AI/Core® platform; 
● | Ability to access outcome data going back over ten years for over 120,000 of the tumor cases in our database.

Industry and Market Background and Analysis – Precision Medicine Business
 
Precision medicine is an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that considers individual variability in genes, disease, environment, and lifestyle for each case to develop effective therapies. This approach allows doctors and researchers to predict more accurately which treatment, dose, and therapeutic regimen could provide the best possible outcome.
 
Precision medicine, precisely targeting drugs based on the genomic profile of the patient, has become the aspiration for cancer therapy. Over the past several decades, researchers have identified molecular patterns that are useful in defining the prognosis of a given cancer, determining the appropriate treatments, and designing targeted treatments to address specific molecular alterations. The objective of this precision oncology is to develop treatments tailored to the genetic changes in each person’s cancer, intended to improve the effectiveness of the therapeutic regimen, and minimize the treatment’s effects on healthy cells. However, for a majority of patients the reality is that while many mutations in the patient’s tumor can be identified most are not actionable with current protocols, due to a lack of research regarding which mutations in a tumor confer a sensitivity to a particular drug. As a result, the impact of targeted therapies is low, and uptake in clinical practice is inconsistent.
 
There is now a growing realization that genomics alone will not be enough to achieve the promise of personalized therapeutics, especially for cancer. A multi-omic approach (e.g., assessing the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, responseome, and microbiome) provides researchers and clinicians the comprehensive information necessary for new drug development and individualized therapy. Comparatively, the multi-omic approach provides a three-dimensional, 360-degree view of the cancer, while genomics alone is just a flat, one-dimensional view. However, multi-omic data is difficult to access quickly as it is both costly and time consuming to initiate prospective data collection, and few comprehensive, multi-omic datasets exist, especially specific to cancer. Our Helomics TumorSpace database addresses this need.
 
Clinical Testing
 
Via our Helomics subsidiary, we offer a group of clinically relevant, cancer-related tumor profiling and biomarker tests for gynecological cancers that determine how likely the patient is to respond to various types of chemotherapy and which therapies might be indicated by relevant tumor biomarkers.
Clinic diagnostic testing is comprised of our Tumor Drug Response Testing (ChemoFx) and Genomic Profiling (BioSpeciFx) tests. The Tumor Drug Response Testing test determines how a patient’s tumor specimen reacts to a panel of various chemotherapy drugs, while the Genomic Profiling test evaluates the expression and/or status of a particular gene related to a patient’s tumor specimen. Our proprietary TruTumor platform provides us with the ability to work with actual live tumor cells to study the unique biology of the patient’s tumor in order to understand how the patient responds to treatment.
 
Testing involves obtaining tumor tissue during biopsy or surgery which is then sent to our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) certified laboratory using a special collection kit. Tumor Drug Response Testing is a fresh tissue platform that uses the patient’s own live tumor cells to help physicians identify effective treatment options for each gynecologic cancer patient.
 
    6 

  

Genomic Profiling offers a select group of clinically relevant protein expression and genetic mutation tests associated with drug response and disease prognosis. Physicians can select biomarkers for testing from carefully chosen panels of relevant tests, intuitively organized by cancer pathway and tumor type. Results for these tests are presented in a clear, easy to understand format, including summaries of the clinical relevance of each marker.
 
Business Strategy for Precision Medicine Business
 
We are a data and AI-driven discovery services company that provides AI-driven predictive models of tumor drug response to improve clinical outcomes for patients by leveraging our two primary unique assets:

● | TruTumor - a clinically validated tumor-profiling platform that can generate drug response profiles and other multi-omic data. Over $200 million has been invested in this platform by us and previous owners and was clinically validated in ovarian cancer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | TumorSpace model contains data on the drug response profiles across 131 cancer types over 10+ years of clinical testing. 

 
Over 38,000 of the more than 150,000 clinically validated cases in our TumorSpace database are specific to ovarian cancer. The data in TumorSpace is highly differentiated, having both drug response data, biomarkers, and access to historical outcome data from those patient samples. We intend to generate additional data (genomics and transcriptomics) from these tumor samples to deliver a multi-omic approach to the pharmaceutical industry.
 
Through our Helomics subsidiary, we will utilize both this historical data and the TumorSpace platform to build AI-driven predictive models of tumor drug response and outcome. During 2022, we will commercialize these AI-driven predictive models in revenue generating service projects with pharmaceutical, biotech, and diagnostic companies.
 
A key part of our commercialization strategy is the understanding that our AI-driven models of tumor drug response serve a key unmet need of pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and biotech industries for actionable multi-omic insights on cancer. In collaboration with these companies, using the predictive models, we will accelerate the search for more individualized and effective cancer treatments, through revenue generating projects in biomarker discovery, drug screening, drug repurposing, and clinical trials.
 
Our commercial strategy has identified a portfolio of revenue generating project types that leverage the predictive models, our AI expertise, PeDAL tumor profiling, and CLIA laboratory to provide custom solutions utilizing our full array of assets and expertise.
 
The Cancer Quest 2020 initiative focused initially on ovarian cancer, which is where we have the most expertise, samples, data, and access to outcomes. We are expanding the initiative to include cancers of the lung, breast, colon, and prostate, and will actively seek partners to assist in that effort.
 
We recently completed our product validation for Discovery 21in January 2022, the proof of concept for PeDAL, which incorporates CoRE™, our active machine learning program, with tumor profile data and human tumor samples, to efficiently determine the most effective drug treatment for a specific cancer type. With each iteration of PeDAL, the program learns, predicts, and then directs the most informative wet lab experimentation, while building the predictive model.
 
Discovery 21 is a predictive model, built in an efficient manner using PeDAL. The model revealed drug response patterns that provide insight into the treatment of ovarian cancer. The validation results demonstrated the accuracy of the model that predicted drug response. Within the clinical sector, we will also be able to utilize similar predictive models (once validated) for new clinical decision support tools for individualizing therapy for patients with cancer.
 
    7 

  

These clinical decision support tools are on a longer revenue horizon than the fee-for-service research projects with pharmaceutical companies but, importantly, will provide a steady stream of additional data generation to refine the predictive models for both clinical and research applications.
 
zPREDICTA
 
zPREDICTA develops tumor-specific in vitro models for oncology drug discovery and research by biopharmaceutical companies and other clients and partners. zPREDICTA’s 3D product models accelerate the drug development process for its clients and partners by leveraging the expertise in carcinogenesis, metastasis and the tumor microenvironment. It develops complex in vitro models that recapitulate the physiological environment of human tissue.
 
From target discovery and lead optimization to preclinical evaluation of efficacy and toxicity, the objective is to develop the tools necessary to accurately identify compounds that will have the highest probability of improving human health. Product offerings include preclinical testing services based on our proprietary models directly to clients in the biopharmaceutical industry.
 
zPREDICTA has expertise in creating human, disease-specific tissue microenvironments for testing drug efficacy and safety. Unlike other platforms, the patented 3D models utilize proprietary organ-specific extracellular matrix formulations that match the in vivo milieu of the organ of interest. These models reconstruct both cellular and extracellular compartments of each tissue, which is especially essential for testing of immuno-oncology agents.
 
zPREDICTA technology demonstrates high clinical relevance, enabling its pharma clients to manage pipeline attrition more efficiently by identifying drugs that are effective in patients, from the hundreds, and often thousands, of compounds in development. The tumor-specific models are used a number of biopharmaceutical companies to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of their therapeutic pipelines. Our models replicate the extracellular matrix (“ECM”) of individual organs and disease-specific soluble microenvironment mimicking the biology of human disease, and as such, demonstrate high correlation with clinical response.
 
The zPREDICTA 3D tumor-specific models incorporate tissue-specific extracellular matrices and tumor-specific medium supplements allowing for a true reconstruction of tumor microenvironment. Our approach is compatible with multiple classes of immuno-oncology agents from naked antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates, to bi- and tri-specific compounds, and CAR-T cells. The organ-specific disease models provide 3D reconstruction of human tissues accurately representing each disease state and mimicking drug response.
 
Our platform incorporates both cellular and extracellular elements of tissue microenvironment in an organ- and disease-specific manner.
 

Extracellular components | Cell-cell interactions 
--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------
● extracellular matrix | ● tumor-tumor interactions 
● soluble factors (cytokines, etc.) | ● tumor-stroma interactions 

 
Our platform is designed to evaluate drug candidates and drug combinations within the native microenvironment of human tissues. Our technology is a patient-derived 3D culture platform that recreates the complex human organ microenvironment thereby preserving the critical interactions between a tumor and its surroundings. Our platform supports long-term survival and proliferation of malignant and non-malignant cellular components of tissues. This includes tumor cells, stroma, and immune components. Anticancer compounds tested in our models exhibit high correlation with clinical response when comparing treatment outcomes in the clinic with cellular behavior in response to the therapeutic regimen. Our organ-specific technology is compatible with multiple drug classes, including small molecules, antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, immunomodulatory agents, CAR-T cells, etc. Our platform is fully customizable to the tumor and tissue of interest. It is compatible with multiple cell types, drug classes, and downstream analysis methods.
 
    8 

  

Applications include providing efficacy screening of anticancer compounds, evaluation of mechanisms of drug resistance, identification of new drug combinations, rescue of failed drug candidates, assessment of off-target toxicity, target discovery and biomarker discovery.
 
SOLUBLE BIOTECH
 
Our subsidiary, Soluble Biotech Inc. (“Soluble”), focuses on contract services and research for biopharmaceutical company clients and academic collaborators, focused on solubility improvements, stability studies, and protein production. Specifically, Soluble provides optimized FDA-approved formulations for vaccines, antibodies, and other protein therapeutics in a faster and lower cost basis to its customers. In addition, Soluble enables protein degradation studies, which based on current projections, potentially substantial line of business for the Company.
 
The primary assets of Soluble are our automated High Throughput Self-Interaction Chromatography (HSC™). HSC is a self-contained, automated system that conducts high-throughput, self-interaction chromatography screens on excipients previously approved by the FDA for protein formulations. Our technology measures second virial coefficient (B22 value) of protein-protein interactions to identify excipients that promote protein solubility in solutions. The data generated from HSC screens are analyzed by a proprietary predictive algorithm to identify the optimal combination(s) of buffers, pH, and excipients, resulting in increased solubility and physical stability of proteins. Several of our clients have seen ten-fold and hundred-fold increases in their protein’s solubility while maintaining physical stability. For biopharmaceutical clients this means faster development times and quicker progression of molecules into the clinic. For academic collaborators, this means further progression of biochemical & biology studies necessary to advance fundamental research in areas of unmet medical need.
 
In addition, Soluble provides comprehensive protein stability analysis. Analysis via time-dependent shelf-life studies and forced degradation studies designed to quickly determine which of the previously FDA approved additives that will improve the solubility and stability of proteins in solutions. Services include pre-formulation development, stability assessment, and biophysical characterization which evaluate variables including pH, temperature, humidity, light, oxidizing agents, and mechanical stress to determine the most promising additives, formulation of B22 values and confirmation on conformation stability. We provide clients with a list of the most promising additives from a set of over 40 different additives that can increase the solubility and stability of protein formulations.
 
Soluble also offers protein solubility kits that allow rapid identification of soluble formulations. We provide four different kits to fulfill customer solubility requirements. The kits are in 96-well format and provide the tools and methods to compare relative solubility across 88 common formulations (with 8 controls). Soluble kits utilize a simple mix and spin protocol that quickly evaluates aggregation behavior as a function of pH, salt, and additives costing significantly less than if manually determined. In addition, we provide innovative technologies for bacterial detection and removal in therapeutic proteins that continue to be a significant issue in the pharmaceutical field.
 
In addition, Soluble supplies proprietary technologies for bacterial endotoxin detection and removal. Endotoxin is an inherent byproduct of bacterial expression of therapeutic proteins. However, therapeutic proteins are required to have extremely low endotoxin levels. Soluble provides a product to remove endotoxin that works through multiple molecular interactions for efficient removal over a wide range of buffer conditions with minimal product loss. The detection of endotoxin can also be adversely affected by the protein therapeutic itself. To address this, Soluble provides sample treatment kits to minimize detection interference while using standard detection assays.
 
SKYLINE MEDICAL – The STREAMWAY System
 
Sold through our subsidiary, Skyline Medical Inc. (“Skyline Medical”), the STREAMWAY System virtually eliminates staff exposure to blood, irrigation fluid, and other potentially infectious fluids found in the healthcare environment. Antiquated manual fluid handling methods that require hand carrying and emptying filled fluid canisters present both an exposure risk and potential liability. Skyline Medical’s STREAMWAY System fully automates the collection, measurement, and disposal of waste fluids and is designed to: 1) reduce overhead costs to hospitals and surgical centers; 2) improve compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and other regulatory agency safety guidelines; 3) improve efficiency in the operating room and radiology and endoscopy departments, thereby leading to greater profitability; and 4) provide greater environmental stewardship by helping to eliminate the approximately 50 million potentially disease-infected canisters that go into landfills each year in the United States. We continue to operate the Skyline Medical business by continually improving our strategic opportunities, while focusing our resources on our precision medicine business.

Industry and Market Background and Analysis - Infectious and Biohazardous Waste Management
 
There has long been recognition of the collective potential for ill effects to healthcare workers from exposure to infectious/biohazardous materials. Federal and state regulatory agencies have issued mandatory guidelines for the control of such materials, and in particular, bloodborne pathogens. OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030) requires employers to adopt engineering and work practice controls that would eliminate or minimize employee exposure from hazards associated with bloodborne pathogens. In 2001, in response to the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, OSHA revised the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. The revised standard clarifies and emphasizes the need for employers to select safer needle devices and to involve employees in identifying and choosing these devices. The revised standard also calls for the use of “automated controls” as it pertains to the minimization of healthcare exposure to bloodborne pathogens.
 
Most surgical procedures produce potentially infectious materials that must be disposed with the lowest possible risk of cross-contamination to healthcare workers. Current standards of care allow for these fluids to be retained in canisters and located in the operating room where they can be monitored throughout the surgical procedure. Once the procedure is complete these canisters and their contents are disposed using a variety of methods, all of which include manual handling and result in a heightened risk to healthcare workers for exposure to their contents. Canisters are the most prevalent means of collecting and disposing of infectious fluids in hospitals today. Traditional, non-powered canisters and related suction and fluid disposable products are exempt and do not require FDA clearance. 
 
We believe that our virtually hands free direct-to-drain technology (1) significantly reduces the risk of healthcare worker exposure to these infectious fluids by replacing canisters, (2) further reduces the risk of worker exposure when compared to powered canister technology that requires transport to and from the operating room, (3) reduces the cost per procedure for handling these fluids, and (4) enhances the surgical team’s ability to collect data to accurately assess the patient’s status during and after procedures. In addition to the traditional canister method of waste fluid disposal, several other powered medical devices have been developed that address some of the deficiencies described above. Most of these competing products continue to utilize some variation on the existing canister technology, and while not directly addressing the canister, most have been successful in eliminating the need for an expensive gel and its associated handling and disposal costs.  Our existing competitors with products already on the market have a clear competitive advantage over us in terms of brand recognition and market exposure. In addition, many of our competitors have extensive marketing and development budgets that could overpower an emerging growth company like ours.
 
We expect the hospital surgery market to continue to increase due to population growth, the aging of the population, and expansion of surgical procedures to new areas (for example, use of the endoscope) which requires more fluid management and new medical technology.
 
STREAMWAY System Product Sales
 
Our Skyline Medical division consists primarily of sales of the STREAMWAY System, as well as sales of the proprietary cleaning fluid and filters for use with the STREAMWAY System. We manufacture an environmentally conscious system for the collection and disposal of infectious fluids resulting from surgical and other medical procedures. We have been granted patents for the STREAMWAY System in the United States, Canada, and Europe. We distribute our products to medical facilities where bodily and irrigation fluids produced during medical procedures must be contained, measured, documented, and disposed. Our products minimize the exposure potential to the healthcare workers who handle such fluids.
 
The STREAMWAY System is a wall-mounted fully automated system that disposes of an unlimited amount of suction fluid providing uninterrupted performance for physicians while virtually eliminating healthcare workers’ exposure to potentially infectious fluids collected during surgical and other patient procedures. We also manufacture and sell two disposable products required for the operation of the STREAMWAY System: a bifurcated dual port procedure filter with tissue trap and a single use bottle of cleaning solution. Both items are utilized on a single procedure basis and must be discarded after use. The STREAMWAY disposables are a critical component of our business model. Recurring revenues from the sale of the disposables are expected to be significantly higher over time than the revenues from the initial sale of the unit. We have exclusive distribution rights to the disposable solution.

TUMORGENESIS
 
Our subsidiary TumorGenesis is our research and development arm for Helomics and zPREDICTA. TumorGenesis also specializes in media that help cancer cells grow outside the patient’s body and retain their DNA/RNA and proteomic signatures. With this tool, researchers are able to expand and study cancer cell types inherent in blood tumors and organ systems of all mammals, including humans.
Competition and Competitive Advantages
 
Precision Medicine Business. We presently have clinical information, including tumor drug response data and an in-house bioinformatics AI platform. Cancer treatments require at least 5 years of testing to see progression-free survival rates. While competitors must wait for this data, we can leverage that data today. Other companies within our market segment are spending significant investment dollars to generate this data which they cannot leverage until the future. We can leverage the data today by sequencing the tumors and gathering the outcome data which is measured in months instead of years. In addition, the following points detail the key differentiators in our model building approach.

● | AI Models are built with real world data on how patient tumors responded to drugs, together with clinical outcome (progression-free survival/overall survival). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We believe this patient-centric, highly standardized, and curated, multi-omic tumor model offers a better chance of generating serviceable predictive models of drug-response and outcomes than competitive approaches in the market today. The information embodied in the AI-driven predictive model provides insights into each tumor’s response to different therapeutic options, resulting in the ability to provide actionable insights critical to both new drug development and individualizing patient treatment.

 
zPREDICTA. Our next-generation technology based on extensive research of the human tumor microenvironment creating accurate reconstruction of the organ-specific 3D tissue microenvironment enabling evaluation of therapeutic agents under conditions mimicking human physiology. The main competitive advantage of zPREDICTA’s technology is the tumor-specific nature of its systems. 3D models replicate tissue heterogeneity and provides long-term maintenance of primary human cells, organoids, and cell lines under the native conditions of human disease. The 3D models are formulated to mimic the tissue and disease of interest instead of pursuing a one-size-fits-all approach taken by other companies. Services provide reliable prediction of clinical outcomes based on accurate reconstruction of cellular and extracellular compartments of human tissues.
 
Soluble Biotech. HSC Technology is a self-contained, automated system that conducts high-throughput, self-interaction chromatography screens on FDA approved excipients for protein formulations. The HSC Instrument and its technology has been validated over the past twelve years via industry and academic collaborations. The data generated from HSC screens are analyzed by a proprietary predictive algorithm to identify the optimal combination(s) of buffers, pH, and excipients, resulting in increased solubility and physical stability of proteins. Several of our clients have seen ten-fold and hundred-fold increases in their protein’s solubility while maintaining physical stability. For biopharmaceutical clients this means faster development times and quicker progression of molecules into the clinic.
Skyline Medical. We believe that the STREAMWAY System is unique to the industry in that it not only allows continuous suction but also provides for unlimited capacity, eliminating the need to interrupt a procedure to change canisters. To our knowledge, the STREAMWAY System is the only known fully automated direct‐to‐drain system that is wall‐mounted and able to collect, measure, and dispose of an unlimited amount of waste fluid without interruption.

Suppliers
 
We buy our raw materials from several suppliers and, except as set forth below, the loss of any one supplier would not materially adversely affect our business. We rely on sole suppliers for certain materials used to perform our molecular diagnostic tests. We also purchase reagents used in our molecular diagnostic tests from sole-source suppliers. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain that these strategies will be effective or that the alternative sources will be available in a timely manner. If our current suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials, we need to perform molecular diagnostic tests, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, there could be an interruption in molecular diagnostic test processing. In the event of the loss of these suppliers, we could experience delays and interruptions that might adversely affect the financial performance of our business.
 
We also have single suppliers for the manufacturing of certain of our Skyline Medical products. Alternative suppliers are available in the market; however, we could experience delays and interruptions that might adversely affect the financial performance of our business including time for machine tooling specific to our products.
 
We have existing and good relationships with our service vendors.
 
Research and Development (“R&D”)
 
We spent $315,850 and $372,710 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, on R&D. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret intellectual property rights, and other measures to protect our intellectual property to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, in part, with confidentiality agreements with employees, although we cannot be certain that the agreements will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies if a breach were to occur.
 
zPREDICTA. Our technology is a patient-derived 3D culture platform that recreates the complex human organ microenvironment thereby preserving the critical interactions between a tumor and its surroundings. Our models replicate the extracellular matrix of individual organs and disease-specific soluble microenvironment mimicking the biology of human disease, and as such, demonstrate high correlation with clinical response.

Government Regulation
 
Our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including some specific to our business, some specific to our industry, and others relating to conducting business generally (e.g., U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). We also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies. The table below highlights key regulatory schemes applicable to our businesses:

CLIA and State Clinical Laboratory Licensing | CLIA regulates the operations of virtually all clinical laboratories, requiring that they be certified by the federal government and that they comply with various technical, operational, personnel, and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate, reliable, and timely. State laws may require additional personnel qualifications or licenses, quality control, record maintenance, proficiency testing, or detailed review of our scientific method validations and technical procedures for certain tests. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in monetary fines, criminal and civil penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal or state healthcare programs.

Medicare and Medicaid; Fraud and Abuse | Diagnostic testing services provided under Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to complex, evolving, stringent, and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws, and regulations, including those relating to billing, coverage, and reimbursement. Anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to Medicare, Medicaid, or certain other federal or state healthcare programs. In addition, federal and state anti-self-referral laws generally prohibit Medicare and Medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have an ownership or investment interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, the testing laboratory, unless specific exceptions are met. Federal substance abuse legislation enacted in 2018 contains anti-kickback provisions that are, by their terms, applicable to laboratory testing paid for by all payers. Upon full review of the legislation, we were in compliance at that time and continue to maintain compliance. We monitor regularly and reflect this in our annual compliance report. Some states have similar laws that are not limited in applicability to only Medicare and Medicaid referrals and could also affect tests that are paid for by health plans and other non-governmental payers. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in monetary fines, criminal and civil penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal or state healthcare programs. 
FDA | The FDA has potential regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, software, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States. The FDA may assert regulatory oversight over these areas, and legislative proposals addressing FDA oversight of laboratory developed tests have been introduced in the past and may be enacted in the future. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of the possible impact of such regulatory or legislative developments.

Environmental, Health and Safety | We are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees, and the handling, transportation, and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste, radioactive materials, various aspects of pertinent technologies and methods of protection.

Privacy and Security of Health and Personal Information | We are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information, including: (1) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations thereunder, which establish (a) a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and (b) comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information; (2) state laws; and (3) the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. A healthcare provider may be subject to penalties for non-compliance and may be required to notify individuals or state, federal, or county governments if the provider discovers certain breaches of personal information or protected health information. 

 
To date, no regulatory agency has established exclusive jurisdiction over the area of biohazardous and infectious waste in healthcare facilities.
 
FDA Clearance of STREAMWAY System under Section 510(k)
 
The FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health requires 510(k) submitters to provide information that compares its new device to a marketed device of a similar type, in order to determine whether the device is substantially equivalent.
 
We filed the 510(k) submission for clearance of the STREAMWAY System device on March 14, 2009 and received written confirmation on April 1, 2009 that our 510(k) has been cleared by the FDA.
 
Following this 510(k) clearance by the FDA, we continue to be subject to the normal ongoing audits and reviews by the FDA and other governing agencies. These audits and reviews are standard and typical in the medical device industry, and we do not anticipate being affected by any extraordinary guidelines or regulations.
 
Our subsidiary, Skyline Medical has successfully passed FDA audits in the past, with no observations or 483 warning letters issued.
 
Application for Electrical Safety Testing and Certification for STREAMWAY System
 
We sought and achieved testing and certification to the IEC 60606-1 and IEC 60606-1-2, two internationally recognized standards.
 
The 60601-1 3rd edition certification for our STREAMWAY System is valid and enables us to continue to market and sell our product domestically and internationally.
 
We have contracted with TUV, a nationally recognized testing laboratory-NRTL, to certify our STREAMWAY System to the new 60601-1 3rd Edition in late 2016. We attained certification to the new standard, and then submitted it to our Notified Body (BSI) for recommendation for our CE Mark, which we received in June 2017, allowing us to sell products outside of the United States.
