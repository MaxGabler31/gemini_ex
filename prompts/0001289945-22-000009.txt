We offer our services and products to three major market segments: healthcare, government, and large enterprise, with a greater emphasis on the healthcare market segment. 
In February 2022, our Board of Directors announced a new strategic business plan. In accordance with this plan, the Company expects to discontinue Spok Go and intends to eliminate all associated costs. Additional information related to the new strategic business plan can be found throughout this 2021 Form 10-K.
Industry Overview
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. The pandemic has had a severe impact on the global economy and has caused a significant strain on the healthcare industry. In the early months of the pandemic, hospitals struggled to maintain capacity within their intensive care units, and most stopped performing elective procedures in order to reallocate bed capacity to meet the surge of critical COVID-19 patients. Simultaneously, non-emergency clinic visits declined, resulting in a marked decrease in total clinic visits and non-COVID-19-related hospitalizations. This placed a significant burden on hospital cash flow and revenue, which many organizations were still recovering from towards the end of 2020 and into 2021. 
While the impact of COVID-19 has varied greatly from one organization or region to the next, in general, reducing costs was a critical theme for the healthcare provider industry in 2020 and 2021. Initially, many organizations furloughed employees or significantly slowed the contracting process for new products or services as they braced for the unknown impacts of this virus. Some organizations enacted a complete moratorium on product renewals and new purchases. As hospitals began to better manage their admissions process and capacity constraints, they began to resume performing elective procedures in the second half of 2020. As a result, we began to see improved operating levels during this period and into 2021. While we are likely to see some lingering and continued effects from COVID-19, barring the emergence of a severe COVID-19 variant of concern, which might have significant negative effects on the overall economy and our customer base specifically, we anticipate a return to pre-pandemic operating levels in 2022.
Aside from the serious impact that COVID-19 has had on the healthcare industry, the United States healthcare market continues to experience significant change. Healthcare costs continue to rise, reimbursements from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are being reduced in certain areas, digitization of healthcare information continues and the industry continues to shift towards a value-based purchasing model and away from the traditional fee-for-service model. The value-based purchasing model places an emphasis on incentivizing value and quality at an individual patient level in order to provide better patient outcomes and reduce 30-day readmissions.
In response, healthcare providers now require greater communication and better collaboration between clinicians in order to generate improvements in the quality, safety, satisfaction and efficiency of patient care delivery. Improvements in these areas are necessary for healthcare providers to successfully navigate many of these issues. Many providers are seeking improvement through the adoption of technology, looking to take advantage of workflow automation, process improvement and, in limited circumstances, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Providers also look to increase efficiencies through consolidation as larger health systems continue to acquire smaller hospitals for the primary purpose of gaining regional market share amongst tough competition.
We believe these changes and continued pressure for organizations to provide improved services with fewer resources place an even greater emphasis on the need for improved clinical communication and collaboration tools to meet the increasing requirements demanded by the healthcare industry in today’s marketplace. Our solutions help hospitals significantly increase the quality and safety of patient care delivery, while increasing patient and provider satisfaction and simultaneously increasing employee productivity, reducing costs and clinician burnout. This is accomplished through workflow enhancement; secure, reliable and integrated communication tools; and mobile accessibility.
Sales and Marketing
We offer a focused suite of unified clinical communication and collaboration solutions primarily to organizations in the healthcare sector. We generate wireless revenue from the sales of wireless messaging services, equipment, maintenance plans and/or equipment loss protection to both one-way and two-way messaging subscribers. We generate software revenue from the sale of our software solutions, including software licenses, professional services, equipment we procure from third parties, and post-contract support.
Sales
We market and distribute our clinical communication and collaboration solutions through a direct sales force and an indirect sales channel.
The direct sales force contracts or sells products, solutions, messaging services and other services directly to customers ranging from small and medium-sized businesses to companies in the Fortune 1000, healthcare and related businesses, and federal, state, and local government agencies. We will continue to market primarily to commercial enterprises, with a focus on healthcare organizations, interested in our communication solutions. We maintain a sales presence in key markets throughout the United States, and in limited markets internationally including our Asia-Pacific sales team, in an effort to gain new customers and to retain and increase sales to existing customers. The direct sales force targets leadership responsible for the procurement of clinical communication and collaboration solutions such as chief information officers, chief technology officers, chief medical officers, chief nursing officers, information technology directors, telecommunications directors, laboratory directors, radiology directors and contact center managers. The timing for a direct sale varies but may take from 6 to 18 months depending on the type and scope of software solution.
The indirect sales force complements our direct sales force. Through relationships with alliance partners we are able to sell our solutions to a wider customer base. For wireless services that we do not provide directly, we contract with and invoice an intermediary for airtime services. For our software sales, relationships with alliance partners assist us in broadening the distribution of our products and further diversifying into markets outside of the healthcare provider vertical. We will continue to expand partnership efforts in 2022.
Within our target market, we have identified and focused our efforts to address the following dynamics:
•A heightened awareness of the ubiquitous, critical role of communications in healthcare;
•An increased focus within hospitals on quality of care and patient safety initiatives;
•The importance of confidentiality when sharing information;
•Increased regulations that may result in process changes, increased documentation and reporting and increased costs;
•A continuing focus within hospitals to reduce labor and administrative costs while increasing productivity; and
•A broader proliferation of information technology in healthcare as hospitals strive to apply technology to solve their business problems.
Marketing
We have a centralized marketing function, which is focused on supporting our solutions and sales efforts by strengthening our corporate brand, generating sales leads, and facilitating the sales process. Our principal marketing programs include:
•Content marketing (eBriefs, case studies, brochures, videos, infographics, and more) as an underlying foundation of all marketing campaigns or initiatives;
•Website development and maintenance, which provides product and Company information, customer support options, paging capabilities, as well as thought leadership and engagement;
•Participation at trade shows and industry events, such as Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, College of Healthcare Information Management Executives, Association of Medical Directors of Information Systems, American Organization of Nurse Leaders, and other Healthcare Information technology related shows and conferences;
•Webinars about customer successes, current industry trends, and our solutions;
•Social media involvement to provide information regarding upcoming educational events or new product offerings;
•Industry analyst relationships;
•Newsletters and blog posts to provide information about industry trends and our solutions to customers, prospects, and alliances; and
•Annual customer conferences that solicit feedback on our solutions and services.
Licenses and Messaging Networks
In order to provide our wireless services, we hold licenses to operate on various frequencies in the 900 MHz narrowband. We are licensed by the United States Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) to operate Commercial Mobile Radio Services (“CMRS”). These licenses are required to provide one-way and two-way messaging services over our networks.
We operate local, regional and nationwide one-way networks, which enable subscribers to receive messages over a desired geographic area. One-way networks operating in 900 MHz frequency bands utilize the FLEX™ protocol developed by Motorola Mobility, Inc. (“Motorola"). The FLEX™ protocol has advantages of functioning at higher network speeds (which increases the volume of messages that can be transmitted over the network) and of having more robust error correction (which facilitates message delivery to a device with fewer transmission errors).
Our two-way networks utilize the ReFLEX 25™ protocol, also developed by Motorola. ReFLEX 25™ promotes spectrum efficiency and high network capacity by dividing coverage areas into zones and sub-zones. Messages are directed to the zone or sub-zone where the subscriber is located, allowing the same frequency to be reused to carry different traffic in other zones or sub-zones. As a result, the ReFLEX 25™ protocol allows the two-way network to transmit substantially more messages than a one-way network using the FLEX™ protocols. The two-way network also provides for assured message delivery. The network stores, for a limited amount of time, messages that could not be delivered to a device that is out of coverage for any reason, and when the unit returns to service, those messages are delivered. The two-way paging network operates under a set of licenses called narrowband Personal Communications Service, which uses 900 MHz frequencies. These licenses require certain minimum five and ten-year build-out commitments established by the FCC, which have been satisfied.
Although the capacities of our networks vary by geographic area, we have excess capacity at a consolidated level. We have implemented a plan to manage network capacity and to improve overall network efficiency by consolidating subscribers onto fewer, higher capacity networks with increased transmission speeds. This plan is referred to as network rationalization. Network rationalization will result in fewer networks and therefore fewer transmitter locations, which we believe will result in lower operating expenses due primarily to lower site rent expenses. 
As we continue to implement our network rationalization plan, we expect to have fewer transmitters that can be removed efficiently from our networks and still maintain the level of service required for our customers, and thus the benefits of network rationalization will decline. Cost savings began to slow in 2019 and 2020 as compared to historical cost savings, and we expect this trend to continue in the future. As we reach certain minimum frequency commitments, as outlined by the FCC, we may be limited in our ability to continue our efforts to rationalize and consolidate our networks. Our messaging networks and related infrastructure are located exclusively in the United States.
Generally, our software solutions do not require licenses or permits from federal, state and/or local government agencies in order to be sold to customers. However, certain of our software products are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and are subject to certification by the Joint Interoperability Test Command to be sold to the branches of the armed services of the United States and the United States government. (see "Regulation" below).
Our Strategy
In alignment with our new strategic business plan announced in February 2022, our over-arching strategy is to prioritize free cash flow generation and the return of capital to stockholders, by maximizing revenue and cash generation from our established lines of business while effectively managing expenses. Through targeted investments in these important and valuable business lines, we aim to reinvigorate growth in our legacy software solutions and minimize wireless revenue attrition.
Particular areas of strategic emphasis include:
Acquire new customers and expand relationships within our existing customer base - We will continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts in the healthcare market in order to identify opportunities for new sales as well as grow revenues from our existing customer base. We have ongoing initiatives to further penetrate the hospital segment in the United States, and while we believe there is a significant opportunity to sell clinical communication and collaboration solutions to hospitals located outside the United States, our near-term focus is on the domestic market. 
We have a significant presence in the healthcare marketplace, and we intend to leverage the strength of our market presence and the breadth of our product offerings to further expand our customer base in healthcare.
Minimize wireless revenue attrition - We continue to have a valuable wireless presence in the healthcare market, particularly in larger hospitals. We offer a comprehensive suite of wireless messaging products and services focused on healthcare and "campus" type environments and critical mission notification. We will continue to focus on network reliability and customer service to help minimize the rate of revenue attrition.
We recognize that the number of wireless subscribers, units in service, and the related revenue will likely continue to decline. We intend to continue reducing our underlying cost structure impacting this declining wireless revenue stream by reducing payroll and related expenses as well as network related expenses where possible. We will integrate and consolidate operations as necessary to ensure the lowest cost operational platform for our consolidated business.
The introduction of our GenA pagers in November 2021 is a key initiative that we believe may slow our wireless revenue attrition. Further details on GenA pagers can be found under "GenA Pagers."
Enhance existing software applications - We will continue to invest in the development and enhancement of our Care Connect Suite products and services, although at a significantly reduced rate relative to our total research and development costs over the last several years. Targeted enhancements and continued development efforts are critical to our ability to maintain our core software maintenance revenue and are necessary to drive future software operations revenue. Additionally, targeted enhancements of the Spok Mobile application will be critical in our ability to help further mitigate wireless customer attrition.
Manage expenses – With a renewed focus on generating cash flow it is critical that we manage costs in alignment with our revenue. We will continue to look for ways to reduce our underlying cost structure should revenue continue to decline. While we will continue to invest in the business, we will do so in a more targeted manner to drive tangible earnings that can be returned to our stockholders.
Return capital to our stockholders - We understand that our primary objective is to create long-term stockholder value. We will continue to evaluate how best to deploy our capital resources to support sustainable business growth and maximize stockholder value. In February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.325 per share of common stock, or $1.250 annually, in 2022, and they authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 million of our common stock.
Products and Services
Wireless Products and Related Services
We offer subscriptions to one-way or two-way messaging services for a periodic (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual) service fee. The level of service fees is generally based upon the type of service provided, the geographic area covered, the number of devices provided to the customer and the period of commitment. We also sell devices to resellers who lease or resell them to their subscribers and then sell messaging services utilizing our networks. 
Wireless products and services revenue represented 55%, 56% and 55% of total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Demand for one-way and two-way messaging services declined during these years, and we believe demand will continue to decline for the foreseeable future. As demand for one-way and two-way messaging has declined, we have developed or added service offerings, including our GenA pagers discussed below, in order to optimize our revenue potential and mitigate the decline in our wireless revenues. We will continue to evaluate opportunities within our wireless business while providing customers the highest value possible.
Legacy Wireless Services
A subscriber to one-way messaging services may select coverage on a local, regional, or nationwide basis to best meet their messaging needs, while two-way messaging is generally offered on a nationwide basis. In addition, subscribers either contract to use a messaging device that we own for an additional fixed monthly fee, or they own the device used, after either purchasing it from us or from another vendor. 
We offer exclusive one-way (T5) and two-way (T52) alphanumeric pagers that are configurable to support unencrypted or encrypted operation. When configured for encryption, these devices utilize AES-128 bit encryption, screen locking and remote wipe capabilities. With encryption, these secure paging devices enhance our service offerings to the healthcare community by adding Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") security capabilities to the low cost and high reliability and availability benefits of paging. We also offer ancillary services, such as voicemail and equipment loss or maintenance protection, which help increase the monthly recurring revenue we receive, along with these traditional messaging services. 
GenA Pagers
On November 16, 2021, we announced the launch of our newest pager, GenA. This one-way alphanumeric pager, available on our wide-area paging network, features a high resolution ePaper display, intuitive modern user interface, advanced HIPAA-compliant encryption and security features, over-the-air remote programming, and an antimicrobial housing. The ePaper display advances the user experience with its larger screen featuring a high-resolution, high-contrast display for easy reading in all conditions, while an automatic front-light eases reading messages in the dark. Users can select from various font sizes, and the large GenA display also leverages proportional fonts to maximize key information on a single screen.
GenA pagers also allow for superior message reception in buildings with difficult coverage conditions using the high-powered Spok 900MHz simulcast network. Enhanced over-the-air (OTA) programming through the Spok My Account customer web portal enables remote pager configuration changes such as updating the user’s name on the pager, assigning a pager to a group, deleting message data and encryption keys, modifying global security settings, and remotely unlocking the device. The GenA pager also provides advanced message management features allowing critical messages to be locked to prevent deletion or saved to a separate folder. In addition, separate inbox folders can be set up for group messages.
The GenA pager is the only product available on the market with these capabilities, and we maintain an exclusive arrangement with the product's manufacturer whereby it may not market or sell the product to any third party without our consent. Given the uniqueness of the GenA pager, we believe its development is a key initiative that may help slow our wireless revenue attrition.

In support of our implementation methodology, we manage the various aspects of the process through a professional services automation tool. We may also use third-party professional services firms as supplemental resources to implement our solutions for customers as needed. Professional services revenue represented 12% of total consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 
•Software License Updates and Product Support (Maintenance): Software license updates and product support, which is generally referred to as maintenance when sold to customers, is an important offering to customers who utilize our on-premise software solutions. In order to support our products that provide clinical communication and collaboration solutions to our customer’s organizations, we have a dedicated customer support organization. The customer support organization provides support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year and the service can be accessed via telephone, email or the Internet via the Spok webpage. The Spok support service is augmented by third-party services where needed. Software license updates and product support are generally priced together as a percentage of the software licenses for which these services will be provided. Largely all of our customers purchase maintenance when they purchase new software licenses, after which renewals generally occur on an annual basis and are paid in advance. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified product upgrades as well as maintenance and patch releases that are released during the term of the support period. Software license updates and product support revenue (i.e. Maintenance revenue) represented 27% of total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, 26% for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 25% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Sources of Equipment
We do not manufacture the messaging devices our customers need to make use of our wireless services or the network equipment we use to provide wireless messaging services. We have relationships with several vendors to purchase new messaging devices. Used messaging devices are available in the secondary market from various sources. We believe existing inventory, returns of devices from customers that canceled wireless services, and purchases from other available sources of new and reconditioned devices will be sufficient to meet expected messaging device requirements for the foreseeable future. With the exception of our GenA pagers, the network equipment and messaging devices on which we may place our logo or label are generic.
We sell third-party equipment for use with our software solutions. The third-party equipment that we sell is generally available and does not require any specialty manufacturing to accommodate our software solutions.
We currently have inventory and network equipment on hand that we believe will be sufficient to meet our wireless and software equipment requirements for the foreseeable future. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to global supply chain disruptions from which we are not immune. These disruptions may contribute to delayed production of certain of the products that we offer, including, but not limited to, our recently launched GenA pagers, which are assembled with certain microchip technology that has experienced, and may continue to experience, shortages. Such shortages may result in delayed delivery of the products that we offer to customers.
Intellectual Property
As of December 31, 2021, we held 79 trademarks and six patents, as well as four pending trademarks and one pending patent, which we believe are important to protect our intellectual property. We believe our intellectual property distinguishes our business from our competition and is integral to our continued success in the area of clinical communication and collaboration solutions. The expiration dates of these trademarks range from 2022 to 2033 and can be extended for ten-year periods upon renewals.
Customers
Our customers include businesses and their employees who need to be accessible to their offices or customers, first responders who need to be accessible in emergencies, and third parties, such as other telecommunication carriers and resellers that pay us to use our networks. Customers include businesses, professionals, management personnel, medical personnel, field sales personnel and service forces, members of the construction industry and construction trades, real estate brokers and developers, sales and services organizations, specialty trade organizations, manufacturing organizations and government agencies.
Our wide-ranging customer base allows for low customer revenue concentration and as a result, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
We pursue close, long-term relationships with our customers because we believe strong customer relationships enable us to retain our current customer base and expand our services and revenue to that customer base.
Competition
The competitors and degree of competition vary among our various product categories. Competition is particularly strong for our wireless messaging services. Within the wireless industry, companies compete on the basis of price, coverage area, services offered, transmission quality, network reliability and customer service. We compete by maintaining competitive pricing for our products and services, by providing broad coverage options through high-quality, reliable messaging networks and by providing quality customer service. Direct competitors for wireless messaging services include American Messaging Service, LLC and a variety of other regional and local providers. We also compete with a broad array of wireless messaging services provided by mobile telephone companies, including AT&T Mobility LLC, Sprint Nextel Corporation, T-Mobile USA, Inc., and Verizon Wireless, Inc. This competition has intensified as prices for the services of mobile telephone companies have declined and messaging capabilities are generally available in today's mobile phone devices. Many of these companies possess far greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. 
Most personal communication and other mobile phone devices currently sold in the United States are capable of sending and receiving one-way and two-way messages. Most subscribers that purchase these services no longer need to subscribe to a separate messaging service. As a result, many one-way and two-way messaging subscribers can readily switch to cellular, personal communications service and other mobile telephone services. The decrease in prices and increase in capacity and functionality for cellular, personal communications service, Wi-Fi, and other mobile telephone services have led many subscribers to select combined voice and messaging services from mobile telephone companies as an alternative to our stand-alone messaging services.
We also have a number of competitors whose software products compete with one or more modules of our clinical communication and collaboration solutions. These competitors are a mix of privately held and public companies that offer a number of call center, alerting and mobile communication products. Our primary competitive advantages include having:
•An integrated product suite;
•A communication-driven workflow;
•Certifications, such as those through the Joint Interoperability Test Command (see "Joint Interoperability Test Command" below) and the FDA; and
•A complete directory of contacts throughout the customer enterprise.
Although we have no competitors that offer a comprehensive set of software modules that match our product offerings, several competitors offer software similar to many of our solutions. Selected competitors for portions of our product portfolio include:
•ATN International, Inc.. - Mobile communications solutions;
•CareCloud, Inc. - Healthcare solutions;
•Castlight Health, Inc. - Software as a service health benefits platform;
•Computer Programs and Systems, Inc. - Healthcare IT solutions; 
•Domo, Inc. - Cloud-based solutions; 
•Globalstar, Inc. - Mobile communications solutions;
•Health Catalyst, Inc. - healthcare data and analytics; 
•HealthStream, Inc. - Healthcare workforce solutions;
•NextGen Healthcare, Inc. - Healthcare solutions;
•Ooma, Inc. - Telecommunications;
•OptimizeRx Corporation. - Healthcare solutions;
•ORBCOMM Inc. - Network connectivity and device management solutions; 
•Tabula Rasa Healthcare, Inc. - Healthcare Solutions; and
•Vocera Communications, Inc. - Mobile communications solutions.
In addition to these select competitors, substantially larger companies in the electronic medical records space such as Epic Systems Corporation, Cerner Corporation ("Cerner"), Athenahealth, Inc. and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. may choose to offer software-related solutions similar to our clinical communication and collaboration solutions or may acquire one of our competitors. 
Furthermore, the healthcare sector continues to experience significant consolidation, in large part due to COVID-19, which has highlighted the need to improve patient outcomes, reduce the burden on providers and streamline operations. As certain industries have been challenged during the pandemic, many organizations are motivated to reduce costs and improve efficiencies while others attempt to enter new markets with complementary or divergent product offerings and drive growth. Large acquisitions have recently been announced, including Microsoft Corporation's proposed acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc., and Oracle Corporation's proposed acquisition of Cerner. Should organizations of this size enter the markets in which we operate, they may have a competitive advantage through aggressive pricing power, established brand recognition, extensive capital resources, and broader delivery and distribution channels.
Research and Development
We maintain a product development group, a substantial portion of which is focused on the enhancement of existing software products. Our product development group uses a methodology that balances enhancement requests from a number of sources including customers, regulatory requirements, the professional services staff, customer support incidents, known defects, market and technology trends, and competitive requirements. These requests are reviewed and prioritized based on criteria that include the potential for increased revenue, customer/employee satisfaction, possible cost savings, and development time and expense. 
Human Capital
At December 31, 2021, and 2020, we had 563 and 602 full time equivalent ("FTE") employees, respectively. As part of the restructuring of our business in connection with the new strategic business plan announced by our Board of Directors in February 2022, we intend to eliminate approximately 175 positions, primarily in research and development, but also in professional services, selling and marketing, and back-office support functions. Our employees are not represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Employee Health, Safety and Well-Being
Spok is committed to conducting its business operations in a manner that protects the health and safety of its employees, visitors, contractors and the public, and to the reduction of risks within our work centers. Spok believes that no job is so important that our employees cannot take the time to ensure the work is performed safely and in an environmentally conscious manner. Spok’s policies and procedures are intended to provide employees with the information needed to meet all federal, state and local guidelines for occupational health and safety.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our policies with regard to our employees, whose health and safety is our highest priority. Following strategies recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we have continued to implement enhanced safety measures, including restrictions on business travel, the implementation of remote work arrangements for our office-based employees, and liberal leave policies for employees who may be affected by illness, quarantines or childcare obligations. We are compliant with all federal, state and local regulations as applicable.
Diversity and Inclusion
As a global company, Spok strives to create an environment that embraces diversity and fosters inclusion. We recognize the value and contributions of individuals with a wide range of capabilities, experience, and perspectives, and draws upon this diversity to create value for our customers and maintain an effective and engaged workforce. Spok is committed to maintaining a work environment free from discrimination and harassment, and one where employees are treated with dignity and respect. We refuse to accept or tolerate harassment or discrimination against any employee or applicant for employment. 
Spok has a council composed of employees and executive sponsors to provide feedback and make recommendations regarding our diversity and inclusion policies and practices. We believe that by promoting and supporting inclusiveness and by leveraging our organization’s diversity, we have a competitive advantage that allows us to innovate and draw from our workforce’s differing perspectives. By bringing together employees from diverse backgrounds and providing each an opportunity to develop their skills and actively contribute to our mission, we cultivate an engaged workforce which in turn helps us deliver value to our customers.
Ethical Standards
Integrity is a core tenet of Spok’s culture, and we have measures and controls in place to regularly ensure that our work and organization are held to the highest ethical standards. We provide numerous resources to our employees, including regular, annual training on maintaining these standards. We also maintain employee guidelines and policies that align with Spok’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
Regulation
Federal Regulation
The FCC issues licenses to use radio frequencies necessary to conduct our business and regulate many aspects of the operations that support our wireless revenue. Licenses granted to us by the FCC have varying terms, generally of up to ten years, at which time the FCC must approve renewal applications. In the past, FCC renewal applications generally have been granted upon showing compliance with FCC regulations and adequate service to the public. Other than those still pending, the FCC has thus far granted each license renewal that we have requested.
The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"), requires radio licensees, including us, to obtain prior approval from the FCC for the assignment or transfer of control of any construction permit or station license or authorization of any rights thereunder. The FCC has thus far granted each assignment or transfer request we have made in connection with a change of control.
The Communications Act also places limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licenses, which constitute the majority of our licenses. These foreign ownership restrictions limit the percentage of stockholders’ equity that may be owned or voted, directly or indirectly, by non-United States citizens or their representatives, foreign governments or their representatives, or foreign corporations. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation permits the redemption of our equity from stockholders where necessary to ensure compliance with these requirements.
The FCC’s rules and regulations require us to pay a variety of fees that otherwise increase our costs of doing business. For example, the FCC requires licensees, including Spok, to pay levies and fees, such as universal service fees, to cover the costs of certain regulatory programs and to promote various other societal goals. These requirements increase the cost of the services we provide. By law, we are permitted to bill our customers for these regulatory costs and we typically do so.
Additionally, the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act of 1994, ("CALEA") and certain rules implementing CALEA require some telecommunication companies, including Spok, to design and/or modify their equipment in order to allow law enforcement personnel to "wiretap" or otherwise intercept messages. Other regulatory requirements restrict how we may use customer information and prohibit certain commercial electronic messages, even to our own customers.
In addition, the FCC’s rules require us to pay other carriers for the transport and termination of some telecommunication traffic. As a result of various FCC decisions over the last few years, we no longer pay fees for the termination of traffic originating on the networks of local exchange carriers providing wireline services interconnected with our services. In some instances, we received refunds for prior payments to certain local exchange carriers. We have entered into a number of interconnection agreements with local exchange carriers in order to resolve various issues regarding charges imposed by local exchange carriers for interconnection.
Failure to follow the FCC’s rules and regulations can result in a variety of penalties, ranging from monetary fines to the loss of licenses. Additionally, the FCC has the authority to modify licenses, or impose additional requirements through changes to its rules.
The FDA has determined software systems that connect to medical devices are subject to regulation as medical devices as defined by the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "FDC Act"). Since our middleware software products connect to medical devices, we are required to comply with the FDC Act’s requirements, including but not limited to: registration and listing, labeling, medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events), removal and correction, and good manufacturing practice requirements. We have complied with the regulatory requirements of the FDC Act, and registered and received the necessary clearances for our products. As we modify and/or enhance our software products (including our middleware product), we may be required to request FDA clearance before we are permitted to market these products.
In addition, our software solutions may handle or have access to personal health information subject in the United States to the HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"), and related regulations. These statutes and related regulations impose numerous requirements regarding the use and disclosure of personal health information with which we help our customers comply. Our failure to accurately anticipate or interpret these complex and technical laws could subject us to civil and/or criminal liability. We believe that we are in compliance with these laws and their related regulations.
Although these and other regulatory requirements have not, to date, had a material adverse effect on our operating results, such requirements could have a material impact on our operating results in the future. We monitor discussions at the FCC and FDA on pending changes in regulatory policy or regulations; however, we are unable to predict what changes, if any, may occur in 2022 to regulatory policy or regulations.
State Regulation
As a result of the enactment by the United States Congress of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA") in August 1993, states are now generally preempted from exercising rate or entry regulation over any of our operations. States are not preempted, however, from regulating "other terms and conditions" of our operations, including consumer protection and similar rules of general applicability. Zoning requirements are also generally permissible, however, provisions of the OBRA prohibit local zoning authorities from unreasonably restricting wireless services. States that regulate our services also may require us to obtain prior approval of (1) the acquisition of controlling interests in other paging companies and (2) a change of control. 
At this time, we are not aware of any proposed state legislation or regulations that would have a material adverse impact on our business.
Joint Interoperability Test Command ("JITC") Certification
JITC is a military organization that tests technology for use by the branches of the armed services of the United States and the United States government. JITC certification is required of all systems with joint interfaces or joint information exchanges with other systems used by these organizations and is done to ensure all systems operate effectively together. All information technology and national security systems that exchange and use information to enable units or forces to operate effectively in joint, combined, coalition and interagency operations and simulations must be certified. Once a system has been certified under this program, the certification must be renewed every four years or after any changes that may affect interoperability. The interoperability certification process consists of four basic steps, which are:
•Identify (interoperability) requirements;
•Develop certification approach (planning);
•Perform interoperability test and evaluation; and
•Report certifications and statuses.
We submit and receive JITC certification for certain of our products through the Defense Information Systems Agency, which allows us to sell and implement our solutions at federal government agencies. We currently certify a console, web, speech, mass notification, public safety answering point, call recording and campus 911 product with JITC. We have a roadmap to renew the existing certifications with new releases of existing products and to bring additional products to JITC to increase the products that can be sold to federal agencies.
