Item 1. | Business

Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing or acquiring technologies that help pharmaceutical companies discover and develop medicines. We employ research technologies such as antibody discovery technologies, ion channel discovery technology, Pseudomonas fluorescens protein expression technology, formulation science and liver targeted pro-drug technologies to assist companies in their work toward securing prescription drug and biologic approvals. We currently have partnerships and license agreements with over 140 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Over 400 programs are in various stages of commercialization, development or research and are fully funded by our collaboration partners and licensees. We have contributed novel research and technologies for approved medicines that treat cancer, osteoporosis, fungal infections and postpartum depression, among others. Our collaboration partners and licensees have programs currently in clinical development targeting cancer, seizure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, muscle wasting, liver disease, and kidney disease, among others. We have over 1,600 issued patents worldwide.
We have assembled our large portfolio of fully-funded programs either by licensing our own proprietary drug development programs, licensing our platform technologies such as Captisol or OmniAb to partners for use with their proprietary programs, or acquiring existing partnered programs from other companies. Fully-funded programs, which we refer to as “shots on goal,” are those for which our partners pay all of the development and commercialization costs. For our internal programs, we generally plan to advance drug candidates through early-stage drug development or clinical proof-of-concept and then seek partners to continue development and potential commercialization.
Our business model creates value for stockholders by providing a diversified portfolio of biotech and pharmaceutical product revenue streams that are supported by an efficient and low corporate cost structure. Our goal is to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the promise of the biotech industry in a profitable, diversified and lower-risk business, in contrast to a typical biotech company. Our business model is based on doing what we do best: drug discovery, early-stage drug development, product reformulation and partnering. We partner with other pharmaceutical companies to leverage what they do best (late-stage development, regulatory management and commercialization) to ultimately generate our revenue. We believe that focusing on discovery and early-stage drug development while benefiting from our partners’ development and commercialization expertise will reduce our internal expenses and allow us to have a larger number of drug candidates progress to later stages of drug development.
Our revenue consists of three primary elements: royalties from commercialized products, sales of Captisol material, and contract revenue from license, milestone and other service payments. In addition to discovering and developing our own proprietary drugs, we selectively pursue acquisitions to bring in new assets, pipelines, and technologies to aid in generating additional potential new revenue streams.

Please see impact of COVID-19 pandemic described in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements -Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”. For additional information on the various risks posed by COVID-19 pandemic, please read Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report.
Technologies
A variety of technology platforms that enable elements of drug discovery or development form the basis of our portfolio of fully-funded shots on goal. Platform technologies or individual drugs discovered by Ligand are related to a broad estate of intellectual property that includes over 1,600 patents issued worldwide.
OmniAb Technologies
The OmniAb platform creates and screens diverse antibody pools and is designed to quickly identify optimal antibodies for our partners’ drug development efforts. We harness the power of Biological Intelligence, which we built into our proprietary transgenic animals and paired with our high-throughput screening technologies, to enable the discovery of high-quality, fully-human antibody therapeutic candidates. We believe these antibodies are high quality because they are naturally optimized in our proprietary host systems for affinity, specificity, developability and functional performance. Our partners have access to these antibody therapeutic candidates that are based on unmatched biological diversity and optimized through integration across a full range of technologies, including antigen design, transgenic animals, deep screening and characterization. We provide our partners both integrated end-to-end capabilities and highly customizable offerings, which address critical industry challenges and provide optimized antibody discovery solutions. 
As of December 31, 2021, OmniAb had 57 partners and over 250 active discovery programs, including 25 OmniAb-derived antibodies in clinical development and two approved products, including zimberelimab, which was approved in China for the treatment of recurrent or refractory classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and sugemalimab, which was approved in China for the first-line treatment of metastatic (stage IV) nonsmall cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy.
Pelican Expression Technology™ Platform
The Pelican Expression Technology platform is a robust, validated, cost-effective and scalable platform for recombinant protein production, and is especially well-suited for complex, large-scale protein production. Global manufacturers have demonstrated consistent success with the platform and the technology is currently out-licensed for multiple commercial and development-stage programs. The versatility of the platform has been demonstrated in the production of enzymes, peptides, antibody derivatives and engineered non-natural proteins. Partners seek the platform as it contributes significant value to biopharmaceutical development programs by reducing timelines and costs associated with research and development through commercial manufacturing of therapeutics and vaccines. Given pharmaceutical industry trends toward large molecules with increased structural complexities, the Pelican Expression Technology platform is well positioned to meet these growing needs as the most comprehensive and broadly available, commercially validated protein production platform in the industry.
We acquired the Pelican Expression Technology through our acquisition of Pfenex in October 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we have agreements with more than 20 partners using this technology in more than 30 active programs. Several of our partners have commercial products and late stage clinical product candidates utilizing Pelican Expression Technology.
Captisol Technology
Captisol is a patent-protected, chemically modified cyclodextrin with a structure designed to optimize the solubility and stability of drugs. Captisol was invented and initially developed by scientists in the laboratories of Dr. Valentino Stella, University Distinguished Professor at the University of Kansas’ Higuchi Biosciences Center for specific use in drug development and formulation. This unique technology has enabled several FDA-approved products, including Gilead’s Veklury®, Amgen’s Kyprolis®, Baxter International’s Nexterone®, Acrotech Biopharma L.L.C.’s and CASI Pharmaceuticals’ Evomela®, Melinta Therapeutics’ Baxdela® and Sage Therapeutics’ Zulresso® There are many Captisol-enabled products currently in various stages of development. We maintain a broad global patent portfolio for Captisol with approximately 440 issued patents worldwide relating to the technology (including 45 in the U.S.) and with the latest expiration date in 2035. Other patent applications covering methods of making Captisol, if issued, extend to 2041.
In addition to solid Captisol powder, we offer our partners access to cGMP manufactured aqueous Captisol concentrate. This product offering was established in 2017 to reduce cycle time and increase Captisol production capacity for large volume drug products. We maintain both Type IV and Type V DMFs with the FDA. These DMFs contain manufacturing and safety information relating to Captisol that our licensees can reference when developing Captisol-enabled drugs. We also have active DMFs in Japan, China and Canada. As of December 31, 2021, Captisol-enabled drugs were being marketed in more than 70 countries, and over 50 partners had Captisol-enabled drugs in development.
HepDirect, LTP, and BEPro Technology Platform
The HepDirect and LTP platforms are our proprietary liver-targeting prodrug technologies that can deliver many different chemical classes of drugs to the liver by using a chemical modification that renders an API biologically inactive until cleaved by a liver-specific enzyme. These technologies may improve the efficacy and/or safety of certain drugs and can be applied to marketed or new drug products to treat liver diseases or diseases caused by hemostasis imbalance of circulating molecules controlled by the liver. As of December 31, 2021, we had active HepDirect/LTP programs with three partners using these technologies across five programs.
The BEPro technology platform is a next generation prodrug technology distinct from HepDirect and LTP prodrug technologies, expanding use to non-liver related diseases. BEPro is specifically applicable to nucleotides and nucleotide analogs for the development of compounds with improved product profiles. Ligand has demonstrated improvements in cell penetration and oral, intravenous and inhaled pharmacokinetics with BEPro-enabled nucleotide analogs. As of December 31, 2021, we have one partner using this technology.
SUREtechnology Platform (owned by Selexis)
We acquired economic rights to various SUREtechnology Platform programs from Selexis. The SUREtechnology Platform, developed and owned by Selexis, is a novel technology that improves the way that cells are utilized in the development and manufacturing of recombinant proteins and drugs. As of December 31, 2021, we are entitled to certain economic rights to SUREtechnology Platform license agreements with 11 partners developing or having commercialized 17 programs.
2021 and Recent Major Business Highlights
The Separation and Distribution of OmniAb Business
In November 2021, we announced plans to explore multiple paths for OmniAb to become a stand-alone public company, with the leading option under consideration at that time being an IPO and eventual distribution of OmniAb shares to Ligand shareholders. We now expect to pursue separation of OmniAb through a direct spin-off of 100% of OmniAb equity to shareholders with Ligand capitalizing the OmniAb business directly with $70 million. OmniAb expects to file a Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and complete its separation in the first half of 2022. The distribution is expected to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes to both Ligand and its shareholders. The separation remains subject to final approval by Ligand’s Board of Directors, and Ligand will continue to evaluate other options to optimize value and ensure flexibility to invest in growth. There can be no assurance that this process will result in Ligand pursuing a particular transaction or consummating any such transaction, or that the anticipated benefits of a separation will materialize should the separation be completed.
OmniAb Technology Platform and Partner Updates
CStone Pharmaceuticals received approval from China’s NMPA for Celjemy® (sugemalimab), an OmniAb-derived anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody for the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy.

We supply Captisol to Gilead for sales of Veklury (remdesivir). Gilead received marketing approval from the FDA in October 2020. Veklury is the first and only antiviral treatment of COVID-19 that is FDA approved. The product has regulatory approvals for the treatment of moderate or severe COVID-19 in over 50 countries and is included in more than 60 ongoing clinical trials. We are supplying Captisol to Gilead under a recently signed 10-year supply agreement. We are also supplying Captisol to Gilead’s voluntary licensing generic partners who are manufacturing remdesivir for 127 low- and middle-income countries. We receive our commercial compensation for this program through the sale of Captisol.
Teriparatide Injection Product (PF708) (Alvogen/Adalvo/Kangchen)
We acquired the Teriparatide Injection product with the acquisition of Pfenex Inc. in October 2020. Teriparatide Injection is a drug indicated for uses including the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture. Teriparatide Injection was developed using our Pelican Expression Technology and was approved by the FDA in 2019 in accordance with the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, with FORTEO as the reference product. Our partner, Alvogen launched the product in June 2020 in the United States. For information regarding the CVR issued to Pfenex equityholders, see note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant accounting Policies—Contingent Liabilities.”
Outside the United States, PF708 received marketing authorization throughout the EU in August 2020 under the tradename Livogiva®, was approved in Saudi Arabia in December 2020 under the name Bonteo and is in various stages of regulatory and marketing application processes around the globe and, upon approval, may be marketed as Teriparatide Injection or under various tradenames, such as Bonsity or Livogiva. 
Our partner Alvogen has exclusively licensed the rights to commercialize and manufacture the teriparatide injection product in the United States, while their Adalvo business has the rights to commercialize in the EU, certain countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and the rest of world (ROW) territories (the latter defined as all countries outside of the EU, U.S. and MENA, excluding Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand). Kangchen has exclusively licensed to commercialize PF708, upon receipt of applicable marketing authorizations, in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand and granted a non-exclusive right to conduct development activities in such countries with respect to PF708. Kangchen is responsible for all regulatory submissions, development costs and costs associated with regulatory approvals in these countries.
In accordance with our agreements with Alvogen, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales between 25% and 40% prior to an “A” therapeutic equivalence designation, which increases to a flat 50% if an “A” rating is achieved.
In accordance with our EU, MENA and ROW agreements with Adalvo, we may be eligible to receive additional upfront and milestone payments of $1.5 million and may also be eligible to receive up to 60% of gross profit derived from product sales and regional license fees, if approved, depending on geography, cost of goods sold and sublicense fees.
In accordance with our agreement with Kangchen, we may be eligible to receive additional payments of up to $22.5 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and sales-related milestones. We may be eligible to receive double-digit royalties on any net sales of PF708 in Kangchen’s territory. 
Evomela (Acrotech and CASI)
We supply Captisol to Acrotech Biopharma for sales of Evomela in the U.S. and to CASI Pharmaceuticals for sales of Evomela in China. Evomela received market approval by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). It is the only approved and commercially available melphalan product in China. Evomela is a Captisol-enabled melphalan IV formulation which is approved by the FDA for use in two indications:
•a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to ASCT in patients with multiple myeloma; and 
•for the palliative treatment of patients with multiple myeloma for whom oral therapy is not appropriate.
Evomela has been granted Orphan Designation by the FDA for use as a high-dose conditioning regimen for patients with multiple myeloma undergoing ASCT. The Evomela formulation avoids the use of propylene glycol, which has been reported to cause renal and cardiac side-effects that limit the ability to deliver higher quantities of therapeutic compounds. The use of the Captisol technology to reformulate melphalan is anticipated to allow for longer administration durations and slower infusion rates, potentially enabling clinicians to safely achieve a higher dose intensity of pre-transplant chemotherapy.
Under the terms of the license agreement, Acrotech Biopharma has marketing rights worldwide excluding China and CASI Pharmaceuticals has rights to market in China. We are eligible to receive over $50 million in potential milestone payments under this agreement, royalties on global net sales of the Captisol-enabled melphalan product and revenue from Captisol material sales. Acrotech and CASI’s obligation to pay royalties will expire at the end of the life of the relevant patents or when a competing product is launched, whichever is earlier, but in no event within ten years of the commercial launch.

Sparsentan (Travere) 
Our partner, Travere, is developing sparsentan for orphan indications of severe kidney diseases and is running an on-going global pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (DUPLEX) for sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS. Additionally, Travere is running a global pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (PROTECT) evaluating the long-term nephroprotective potential of sparsentan for the treatment of IgAN nephropathy, a rare, immune complex mediated chronic glomerular disease. Certain patient groups with severely compromised renal function, including those with FSGS and IgAN, exhibit extreme proteinuria resulting in progression to dialysis and a high mortality rate. Sparsentan, with its unique dual blockade of angiotensin and endothelin receptors, is expected to provide meaningful clinical benefits in mitigating proteinuria in indications where there are no approved therapies.
In February of 2021, Travere announced that sparsentan achieved its pre-specified interim FSGS partial remission of proteinuria endpoint (FPRE) in the DUPLEX Phase 3 study after 36 weeks of treatment. Sparsentan demonstrated a statistically significant response on FPRE compared to the active control, irbesartan (p=0.0094). Preliminary results from the interim analysis suggest that sparsentan has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a comparable safety profile to irbesartan. Travere plans to submit an NDA seeking accelerated approval of sparsentan for FSGS in the United States in mid-2022 after obtaining additional estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) data from the DUPLEX Study.
In August of 2021, Travere announced positive topline interim results from the ongoing Phase 3 PROTECT study of sparsentan in IgAN. Sparsentan treatment demonstrated a statistically significant mean reduction of proteinuria from baseline after 36 weeks, more than threefold the reduction of active comparator irbesartan (p<0.0001). In the first quarter of 2022, Travere expects to submit an NDA seeking accelerated approval of sparsentan for IgAN in the United States.
Additionally, Travere and Vifor Pharma entered into a licensing agreement in September of 2021 for the commercialization of sparsentan in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Traver and Vifor expect to submit a combined IgAN and FSGS Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) in mid-2022 for conditional marketing authorization of sparsentan in Europe.
Under our license agreement with Travere, we may be entitled to receive potential milestones of over $70 million and net royalties on future worldwide sales by Travere.

In May 2018, we announced an award of up to $11 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for a project focused on the discovery of therapeutics to treat patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) caused by nonsense mutations. Nonsense mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (“CFTR”) gene result in the premature termination of protein synthesis and the formation of truncated, non-functional CFTR. Patients with these mutations in both copies of their CFTR genes currently have no therapies that treat the underlying cause of their disease. The aim of this program is to provide these patients with a transformative therapeutic that will markedly improve their quality of life and lifespan. The award is to support an integrated, multi-year drug discovery initiative. At the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference in October 2020, we reported the identification and characterization of a class of small molecule agents that enhance CFTR-PTC mutant readthrough and enable functional CFTR currents in combination with aminoglycosides.

Summary of Selected Internal Development Programs 
We have a number of internal development or unpartnered programs focused on a wide-range of potential indications or disease. 
The Captisol-enabled (CE)-Iohexol program was established in January 2018 to develop a next-generation contrast agent for diagnostic imaging with a reduced risk of renal toxicity. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is the acute impairment of renal function following intravascular administration of an iodinated contrast agent, and occurs most frequently following coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention and contrast-enhanced computed tomography, especially among patients at risk of renal injury such as those with advanced age, diabetes or heart failure. Currently no products are approved to prevent or treat CI-AKI in this setting, and therefore we believe a significant opportunity exists for a safer formulation of contrast agents. The goal is for CE-Iohexol to improve upon the limitations of existing contrast agents and enable a future partner to gain meaningful market share. In July 2019, we announced positive top-line results from a Phase 1 clinical trial CE-Iohexol conducted in Canada. The trial achieved the primary endpoint by demonstrating pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of CE-Iohexol injection and a reference Iohexol injection (OMNIPAQUE™) after IV administration in healthy adults. CE-Iohexol injection was well tolerated, and adverse events were in line with the known safety profile of OMNIPAQUE. We submitted an IND with the FDA in November and received a “Study May Proceed” letter in December 2020 along with feedback from the FDA on the clinical plan. Initiation of the Phase 2 clinical trial has been deferred as we assess potential partner interest.
The Luminespib/Hsp90 Inhibitor is a Phase 2-ready Hsp90 inhibitor, previously investigated in clinical trials for cancer. Third-party academic drug analyses suggest a potential role for heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors in treating COVID-19 infection. Based on these studies, we are evaluating potential collaborations or partnerships relating to intravenous luminespib (AUY-922) as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19. 
Our primary research and development efforts are led by our teams in Emeryville, California, San Diego, California, and Durham, North Carolina. The following table represents internal programs eligible for further development or partnership:

Program | Development Stage | Targeted Indication or Disease
CE-Iohexol | Phase 2 | Diagnostics 
Luminespib/Hsp90 Inhibitor | Phase 2 | Oncology

Manufacturing
We contract with a third party manufacturer, Hovione, for Captisol production. Hovione operates FDA-inspected sites in the United States, Macau, Ireland and Portugal. Manufacturing and distribution operations for Captisol are performed primarily at Hovione's Portugal and Ireland facilities. We believe we maintain adequate inventory of Captisol to meet our current and future partner needs.
In the event of a Captisol supply interruption, we are permitted to designate and, with Hovione’s assistance, qualify one or more alternate suppliers. If the supply interruption continues beyond a designated period, we may terminate the agreement. In addition, if Hovione cannot supply our requirements of Captisol due to an uncured force majeure event, we may also obtain Captisol from a third party and have previously identified such parties.
The current term of the agreement with Hovione is through December 2024. The agreement will automatically renew for successive two year renewal terms unless either party gives written notice of its intention to terminate the agreement no less than two years prior to the expiration of the initial term or renewal term. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach or bankruptcy of the other party or an extended force majeure event. We may terminate the agreement for extended supply interruption, regulatory action related to Captisol or other specified events. We have ongoing minimum purchase commitments under the agreement.
Competition
Some of the drugs we and our licensees and partners are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors.
Our Captisol business may face competition from other suppliers of similar cyclodextrin excipients or other technologies that are aimed to increase solubility or stability of APIs. Our OmniAb antibody technology faces competition from suppliers of other transgenic animal systems that are also available for antibody drug discovery such as AbCellera Biologics.
Our competitive position also depends upon our ability to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes. For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)
We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace, promoting environmental excellence in our communities, and complying with all relevant regulations and industry standards. We establish and monitor programs to reduce pollution, prevent injuries, and maintain compliance with applicable regulations. By focusing on such practices, we believe we can affect a meaningful, positive change in our community and maintain a healthy and safe environment. Our animal health facility in Emeryville, California, has accreditation from the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, a nonprofit organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs. We expect to continue our effort and to refine our EHS policies and practices in 2022. More information on our EHS policies and initiatives is available on our website at www.ligand.com.
Government Regulation
The research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. We and our partners, depending on specific activities performed, are subject to these regulations. In the United States, pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation by both federal and various state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products. These activities are subject to additional regulations that apply at the state level. There are similar regulations in other countries as well. For both currently marketed products and products in development, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, the suspension of regulatory approvals, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us or our partners. For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to our inventions that are considered important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Patents are issued or pending for the following key products or product families. The scope and type of patent protection provided by each patent family is defined by the claims in the various patents. Patent term may vary by jurisdiction and depend on a number of factors including potential patent term adjustments, patent term extensions, and terminal disclaimers. For each product or product family, the patents and/or applications referred to are in force in at least the United States, and for most products and product families, the patents and/or applications are also in force in European jurisdictions, Japan and other jurisdictions.
Captisol
Patents and pending patent applications covering Captisol and methods of making Captisol are owned by us. The patents covering the Captisol product with the latest expiration date is set to be in 2033 (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 9,493,582 (expires Feb. 27, 2033)). Other patent applications covering methods of making Captisol, if issued, potentially have terms to 2041. We have asserted U.S. Patents 8,410,077, 9,200,088, and 9,493,582 against Teva in connection with their attempt to obtain FDA approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of Evomela®. We also own several patents and pending patent applications covering drug products containing Captisol as a component. Globally, we own approximately 440 issued patents covering all of the foregoing Captisol compositions, methods and related technology.
