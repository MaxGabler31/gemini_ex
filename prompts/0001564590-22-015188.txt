Company Overview and Developments
 Simply, Inc.’s business is currently centered on its wholly owned subsidiary, Simply Mac, Inc. (“Simply Mac”), and its relationship with Apple® as an Apple Premier Partner authorized to operate retail consumer electronics stores that sell the entire line of Apple products and provide service by Apple-certified technicians.  As of January 29, 2022, Simply Mac had 53 retail stores across 17 states in the United States. 
 We incorporated under the laws of the State of California on February 7, 1994, under the name InfoSonics Corporation. On September 11, 2003, we reincorporated under the same name under the laws of and into the State of Maryland.  Our corporate headquarters are in Miami, Florida, with the administrative office of Simply Mac located in Salt Lake City, Utah.  On June 8, 2018, we changed our name to Cool Holdings, Inc., and on October 14, 2020, changed our name to Simply, Inc.
 Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Fiscal year 2022 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 29, 2022. Fiscal year 2021 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 30, 2021.
 We also formerly operated other businesses, which have since been sold or discontinued.  We had a wholly owned subsidiary that operated 7 retail consumer electronics stores as Apple Premier Partners under the OneClick name in the Dominican Republic that was sold on April 6, 2020.  It has been classified as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements.  Cooltech Distribution, a subsidiary that formerly distributed various consumer electronics to resellers, retailers and small and medium-sized businesses, was wound down by August 1, 2020.
 During March 2020, we restructured substantially all of our then remaining outstanding debt.  At February 1, 2020, the principal amount of our outstanding debt amounted to $16.4 million.  After the March restructuring, our outstanding debt was reduced by $14.6 million through a combination of debt forgiveness and conversion into common stock, leaving $1.8 million outstanding with extended maturity dates.
 On April 16, 2020, we received a $3.1 million loan pursuant to the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) under Title I of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act passed by Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020 (“CARES Act”).  On October 19, 2020, we filed a forgiveness application in which we certified that 100% of the funds were spent on qualified payroll and related costs and requested that the entire principal balance be forgiven.  The application was approved by the lender and the SBA, and the loan and accrued interest were extinguished on August 17, 2021.
 Effective October 14, 2020, we executed a one-for-ten reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock.  All share and per share numbers in this annual report have been retroactively restated to account for the reverse split.
 On March 10, 2021, the Company secured a second-draw, $2,000,000, 1.0%, 5-year loan from the Lender pursuant to the PPP.  No payments are due on this loan until the earlier of: (a) the date on which the amount  of loan forgiveness determined under the CARES Act is remitted to the Lender by the SBA, (b) the date that the SBA advises Lender that all or part of the loan has not been forgiven, provided that the Company has applied for forgiveness within 10 months of the end of the forgiveness period of the loan or (c) if the Borrower fails to apply for forgiveness by the end of the forgiveness period,  a date that is not earlier than the date that is 10 months after the last day of the forgiveness period.  In accordance with the applicable provisions of the CARES Act, on October 28, 2021, the Company filed its forgiveness application with the Lender.  The Company certified in the application that 100% of the loaned funds were utilized during the 22-week covered period commencing March 10, 2021 to pay for qualified payroll and payroll-related costs, and as such, requested that the entire principal balance be forgiven.  The application is subject to review by both the Lender and the SBA, after which the Company will be notified as to whether the application is approved.  If the application is denied or partially approved, the Company will be required to make equal monthly payments to fully amortize any remaining balance by March 10, 2026.

Between July and November 2021, the Company issued five individual six-month, 9%, unsecured convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $4,000,000 and warrants exercisable into an aggregate of 1,600,000 shares of common stock of the Company to SOL Global Investments Corp. (“SOL Global”).  SOL Global is an affiliate of the Company and owns more than 10% of its outstanding common stock.  The principal and unpaid accrued interest on the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time into shares of common stock of the Company at $2.50 per share and the warrants are exercisable beginning six months after the date of issuance and expire 42 months from the date of issuance at an exercise price of $2.75 per share.  Upon maturity of the first note on January 6, 2022, SOL Global converted the entire $1,000,000 principal amount of the note and accrued interest into 418,000 shares of common stock of the Company.  Subsequent to January 29, 2022, the remaining notes were each extended without interest for one year.
 During August and September 2021, the Company raised an aggregate of $2,000,000 in four private placements of the Company’s common stock of $500,000 each to SOL Verano Blocker 1 LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of SOL Global.  The shares of the Company’s common stock were sold at the closing market price on the funding dates, and the Company sold an aggregate of 575,527 shares of its common stock at an average price of $3.48 per share in the private placements.
 Reportable Segments and Geographic Areas
 We currently operate our business in a single segment in the United States through our Simply Mac retail stores.  We previously operated a second segment through our Cooltech Distribution business, but this unit was wound down by August 1, 2020, and its results of operations were immaterial.
Store Operations, Merchandise and Seasonality
 As an Apple Premier Partner, we work with Apple to develop our network of Simply Mac stores in locations and markets where Apple has limited or no presence.  Our stores are generally located in high-traffic or local neighborhood strip centers or shopping malls.  In our stores, we sell Apple and Apple-approved products and accessories, including accessories that we source from independent third parties.  We also provide repair service for Apple products performed by our Apple-certified employee technicians.  Retail customers may book a repair appointment at one of our SimplyMac stores either through our website or, alternatively, through the Apple website.  Our Simply Mac business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with a large portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth calendar quarter of the year.
Purchasing and Suppliers
 The majority of our product purchases are of Apple products, which we buy both directly from Apple as well as from a tier‑one distributor facilitated by our license agreement with Apple.  We also have direct relationships with certain accessory manufacturers and purchase other accessories from distributors.  We believe that maintaining and strengthening our relationships with Apple and our other vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion.
Competition
 The consumer electronics and accessory industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants such as Best Buy, Costco, Wal-Mart and Target, and regional chains; specialty computer product and consumer electronics stores; and online retailers such as Amazon.  We also compete with Apple-owned stores and Apple’s online store.
Sustainability
 We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in programs, we buy back or take in used consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In addition, we continuously look for cost-effective ways to reduce our carbon emissions.
Employees
 As of January 29, 2022, we had 352 full-time salaried employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are members of a collective bargaining unit.
