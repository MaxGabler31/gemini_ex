Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to enabling normal lives for people with autoimmune diseases. Our innovative compound, batoclimab, formerly referred to as IMVT-1401, is a novel, fully human, monoclonal antibody targeting the neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (“FcRn”). Designed to be optimized as a simple, subcutaneous injection with dosing that we believe can be tailored based on disease severity and stage, batoclimab has been observed to reduce immunoglobulin G (“IgG”) antibodies that cause inflammation and disease. 
Our product candidate, batoclimab, has been dosed in small volumes (e.g., 2 mL) and with a 27-gauge needle, while still generating therapeutically relevant pharmacodynamic activity, important attributes that we believe will drive patient preference and market adoption. In nonclinical studies and in clinical trials conducted to date, batoclimab has been observed to reduce IgG antibody levels. High levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies drive a variety of autoimmune diseases and, as a result, we believe batoclimab has the potential for broad application in these disease areas. We intend to develop batoclimab in autoimmune diseases for which there is robust evidence that pathogenic IgG antibodies drive disease manifestation and for which reduction of IgG antibodies should lead to clinical benefit. 
Autoimmune diseases are conditions where an immune response is inappropriately directed against the body’s own healthy cells and tissues. According to the 2020 Report of the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association, approximately 50 million people in the United States suffer from one of more than 100 diagnosed autoimmune diseases. Predisposing factors may include genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers and other factors not yet known. Many of these diseases are associated with high levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies, which are the most abundant type of antibody produced by the human immune system, accounting for approximately 75% of antibodies in the plasma of healthy people. IgG antibodies are important in the defense against pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. In IgG-mediated autoantibody diseases (an important subset of autoimmune diseases), IgG antibodies inappropriately develop against normal proteins found in the body, directing the immune system to attack specific organs or organ systems.
Unfortunately, safe and effective treatment options for patients suffering from many autoantibody diseases are lacking. Historically available treatments are generally limited to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants in early-stage disease and intravenous immunoglobulin (“IVIg”) or plasma exchange in later-stage disease. These approaches often fail to address patients’ needs since they are limited by delayed onset of action, waning therapeutic benefit over time and unfavorable safety profiles.
The physiologic function of FcRn is to prevent the degradation of IgG antibodies. Inhibition of FcRn, such as through use of an anti-FcRn antibody, has been shown to reduce levels of total IgG and pathogenic IgG antibodies. We believe our completed clinical trials and other clinical trials assessing anti-FcRn antibodies in IgG-mediated autoantibody diseases have generated promising results, suggesting that FcRn is a therapeutically important pharmacologic target to reduce levels of disease-causing IgG antibodies.
In several nonclinical studies and in a multi-part Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, intravenous and subcutaneous delivery of batoclimab was generally well tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent IgG antibody reductions. In the highest dose cohorts in the Phase 1 clinical trial, four weekly subcutaneous administrations of 680 mg resulted in a mean maximum reduction of serum IgG levels of 78%, with a standard deviation of 2%. Injection site reactions were similar between batoclimab and placebo arms.
We obtained rights to batoclimab pursuant through our license agreement (the “HanAll Agreement”) with HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd. (“HanAll”). Pursuant to the HanAll Agreement, we will be responsible for future contingent payments and royalties, including up to an aggregate of $442.5 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestone events. We are also obligated to pay HanAll tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to mid-teens percentage of net sales of licensed products, subject to standard offsets and reductions as set forth in the HanAll Agreement.
As previously disclosed, we voluntarily paused dosing in our early phase clinical studies to evaluate batoclimab-induced elevations in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (“LDL”) levels observed in some trial subjects. After evaluation of the available safety data and following discussions with multiple regulatory agencies, we are continuing the clinical development of batoclimab. We intend to develop batoclimab as a self-administered subcutaneous injection, which we believe can be tailored based on disease severity and phase of treatment (i.e., induction or maintenance). 
We are conducting a Phase 1 drug-drug interaction (“DDI”) study in healthy volunteers to characterize the pharmacokinetic (“PK”) profile of atorvastatin with and without the coadministration of batoclimab. We believe, based on these preliminary data and feedback from physicians, that a batoclimab-induced increase in LDL-cholesterol can be managed with anti-lipid therapy as needed.
We are currently developing batoclimab for Myasthenia Gravis (“MG”), Thyroid Eye Disease (“TED”) and Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (“WAIHA”). As a result of our rational design and current outlook on potential opportunities, we believe that batoclimab, if developed and approved for commercial sale, would be differentiated from currently available, more invasive treatments for advanced IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. Based on third-party patient prevalence estimates for the more than 15 indications that have been announced by multiple companies for clinical development with anti-FcRn assets, including our planned development of batoclimab in MG, TED and WAIHA, we estimate the total potential opportunity for batoclimab to be greater than two million patients in the United States (the “U.S.”) and Europe (Europe includes all European Union countries (the “E.U.”), the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and Switzerland).
To the extent we choose to develop batoclimab as a potential treatment for certain of these rare diseases, we plan to seek orphan drug designation in the United States and Europe, where applicable. Such designations would primarily provide financial and exclusivity incentives intended to make the development of orphan drugs financially viable. In July 2021, we were granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for batoclimab for the potential treatment of MG. We plan to seek orphan drug designation from the FDA for batoclimab for the treatment of TED and WAIHA, and potentially other orphan indications in which there is a medically plausible basis for batoclimab’s use. We may seek orphan drug designation for batoclimab in Europe.
We intend to continue the development of batoclimab for the treatment of MG, TED and WAIHA, as well as two new indications to be announced by August 2022. We expect one of our three indications beyond MG and TED to be initiated as a pivotal study in the calendar year 2022.
Current Indications in Development
MG is an autoimmune disease associated with muscle weakness with an estimated prevalence of 17.8 per 100,000, with up to 59,000 cases in the U.S. Third-party studies estimate the prevalence in Europe for MG as 24.2 per 100,000, or approximately 126,000 cases. In MG, patients develop pathogenic IgG antibodies that attack critical signaling proteins at the junction between nerve and muscle cells. The majority of MG patients suffer from progressive muscle weakness, with maximum weakness occurring within six months of disease onset in most patients. In severe cases, MG patients can experience myasthenic crisis, in which respiratory function is weakened to the point where it becomes life-threatening, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. See “Batoclimab as a Potential Treatment for Myasthenia Gravis” below for further discussion. 
TED is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the muscles and other tissues around the eyes, and in severe cases can be sight-threatening. TED has an estimated annual incidence of 9.7 in 100,000 in the U.S. and 4.8 in 100,000 in Europe. Initial symptoms may include a dry and gritty ocular sensation, sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, double vision and a sensation of pressure behind the eyes. See “Batoclimab as a Potential Treatment for Thyroid Eye Disease” below for further discussion. 
WAIHA is a rare hematologic disease in which autoantibodies mediate hemolysis, or the destruction of red blood cells (“RBCs”). Based on published estimates, we believe that there are approximately 40,000 patients in the U.S. and 71,000 patients in Europe living with WAIHA. The clinical presentation is variable and most commonly includes symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, skin paleness and shortness of breath. In severe cases, hemoglobin levels are unable to meet the body’s oxygen demand, which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure and even death. See “Batoclimab as a Potential Treatment for Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia” below for further discussion. 
Potential New Indications
We continue to evaluate potential new indications for batoclimab by considering a number of factors including, but not limited to, degree of unmet medical need, potential benefit offered by the treatment, target patient population size, and commercial potential.
We have identified additional attractive indications with high unmet need and scientific rationale for anti-FcRn therapy. We also believe that certain indications with existing anti-FcRn programs offer a significant opportunity to provide unique patient benefits and therefore represent a strong potential opportunity. As previously disclosed, we plan to announce two new indications by August 2022. 
Business Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company in the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for autoimmune diseases with significant unmet need. To execute our strategy, we plan to:
•Maximize the probability of success of batoclimab. We plan to leverage batoclimab’s differentiated profile in indications where the anti-FcRn mechanism has already established clinical proof-of-concept, including MG and TED.
•Maximize the breadth of indications for batoclimab. In addition to pursuing indications with existing anti-FcRn proof of concept data, we are also considering first-in-class indications where the probability of technical success is good even without existing anti-FcRn clinical data based on potential to deliver clinical benefit with targeted IgG reduction. 
•Rationale for the prioritization of potential indications. We intend to prioritize potential indications (whether or not first-in-class) based on the degree of unmet medical need, the potential benefit offered by the treatment, the target patient population size, and the commercial potential.
•Identify and acquire or in-license additional innovative therapies for autoimmune diseases. Our controlling stockholder, Roivant Sciences Ltd. (“RSL”), and its subsidiaries, have a track record of acquiring or in-licensing products in a range of therapeutic areas. We will continue to partner and collaborate with RSL in identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and in-licensing opportunities in support of our goal to develop and commercialize innovative therapies for autoimmune diseases with significant unmet need.
Our Pipeline
The following is our current development pipeline:
Batoclimab as a Potential Treatment for Myasthenia Gravis
Myasthenia Gravis Overview
MG is an autoimmune disorder associated with muscle weakness and fatigue. MG patients develop antibodies that lead to an immunological attack on critical signaling receptor proteins at the junction between nerve and muscle cells, thereby inhibiting the ability of nerves to communicate properly with muscles. This leads to muscle weakness intensified by activity, which can be localized exclusively to ocular muscles or which can be more generalized throughout the body including muscles of respiration. Patients with localized ocular disease suffer from more limited symptoms, including droopy eyelids and blurred or double vision due to compromise of eye movements. The vast majority of MG patients demonstrate elevated serum levels of acetylcholine receptor (“AChR”) antibodies which disrupt signal transmission between nerve fibers and muscle fibers. These antibodies ultimately lead to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue.
The prevalence of MG is estimated to be 17.8 per 100,000, with up to 59,000 cases in the U.S. Third-party studies estimate the prevalence in Europe for MG as 24.2 per 100,000, or approximately 126,000 cases. MG can occur at any age; however, the age of onset tends to follow a bimodal distribution. Early onset disease usually occurs in individuals between 10 to 30 years old and predominantly affects females. Later onset disease usually occurs in individuals over 50 years old and predominantly affects males. As with many autoimmune diseases, there are no known genetic alterations that specifically cause MG, and in most patients, it arises spontaneously. Approximately 3% of patients have a primary relative with MG, suggesting that there are genetic factors that may predispose development of the disease, but these genes have yet to be identified.
The symptoms of the disease can be transient and in the early stages of the disease can remit spontaneously. However, as the disease progresses, symptom-free periods become less frequent and disease exacerbations can last for months or remain chronic. After 15 to 20 years, some weakness often becomes fixed, with the most severely affected muscles frequently becoming atrophic. Many patients find it difficult to perform daily activities due to both insufficient improvement in symptoms even after treatment and in some the complicating long-term side effects of oral corticosteroids, a common treatment for MG. Approximately 15% to 20% of MG patients will experience at least one myasthenic crisis over their lifetimes. During myasthenic crisis, the impairment of muscles required to breathe can become life-threatening, leading to death in approximately 2% to 5% of cases. Up to 90% of patients in myasthenic crisis require intubation and mechanical ventilation leading to hospital stays lasting a median of 17 days. Over half of the patients who survive such a crisis remain functionally dependent upon discharge from the hospital.
Current Treatment Paradigm
Very early stage MG is symptomatically treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine. As the disease progresses, patients are typically treated with immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. Thymectomy may be indicated for treatment in patients with evidence of a thymoma and can be considered for treatment in some younger patients who do not have evidence of thymoma. As MG becomes more advanced, patients can be treated during exacerbations with IVIg, which provides therapeutic benefit through multiple potential mechanisms including the saturation of FcRn. Physicians direct patients with more advanced chronic disease and patients in times of crisis to therapies that reduce levels of circulating IgG antibodies via plasma exchange or a variant of this plasma exchange, immunoadsorption. The most recent agents approved for MG are eculizumab and ravulizumAb-cwvz, two complement C5 inhibitors, the use of which are limited to patients refractory to available therapy with anti-AChR-positive MG. Efgartigimod, an anti-FcRn antibody fragment, was recently approved for the treatment of MG in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive. We believe there is room to improve upon this current treatment paradigm for MG, as some of these treatments can leave patients with burdensome administration requirements, significant side effects or long wait times to see treatment effect.
In 2019, we initiated a multi-center, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of batoclimab for the treatment of MG. As evaluated in a pre-specified, pooled analysis of 15 subjects who completed Day 42 of the trial, batoclimab-treated subjects (N=10) showed a clinical improvement in both the MG-ADL scale and the MGC scale. We believe, based upon our review of data from this Phase 2a trial of batoclimab in MG, that there is sufficient proof of concept to pursue a pivotal trial to evaluate batoclimab for the treatment of MG.
Batoclimab Phase 3 Trial
As previously disclosed in December 2021, we achieved alignment with the FDA Division of Neurology 1 to move forward with our pivotal trial of batoclimab as a treatment for MG. We plan to initiate this Phase 3 trial by the end of June 2022. We expect top-line data from this Phase 3 trial to be available in the second half of calendar year 2024.
Our trial is designed to address unmet patient needs and differentiate batoclimab from other treatments. Key features of the trial include:
•12-week Induction Period: Includes doses of 680 mg subcutaneous injection weekly (“SC QW”) or anchor dose of 340 mg SC QW compared to placebo. The objective is to achieve maximum efficacy at the beginning of treatment and determine the potential benefit of 680 mg SC QW (i.e., speed and depth of clinical response).
•12-week Maintenance Period: Includes anchor doses of 340 mg SC QW and 340 mg subcutaneous injection once every two weeks compared to placebo to assess lower effective maintenance doses with potentially fewer side effects related to long term IgG suppression or serum analyte changes.
•52-week Long Term Extension: Includes long term safety assessment of the 2 maintenance doses; also includes tailored dosing allowing for treatment of disease exacerbations with short-term, re-induction dosing of batoclimab (680 mg SC QW x 4 weeks) followed by resumption of 340 mg SC QW. 
MG Phase 3 Trial Design (N ~ 210)
QW = weekly, Q2W = once every two weeks, SC = subcutaneous injection
Batoclimab as a Potential Treatment for Thyroid Eye Disease
Thyroid Eye Disease Overview
TED, also referred to as GO, is a sight-threatening autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the muscles and tissues surrounding the eyes. Initial symptoms may include a dry and gritty ocular sensation, sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, double vision, and a sensation of pressure behind the eyes. At diagnosis, many patients with TED have retraction of their upper eyelids, swelling and redness surrounding the eyes, and protrusion of their eyeballs (proptosis). In some cases, swelling and stiffness of the eye muscles prevent the eyes from working together causing double vision. Approximately 3% to 5% of TED patients have a severe manifestation of the disease causing intense pain, inflammation, sight-threatening corneal ulcers, or optic neuropathy requiring surgical intervention. Decompression surgery to improve ocular function or rehabilitative surgery to improve quality of life is required in up to 20% of TED patients.
TED is most commonly caused by IgG autoantibodies that form against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (“TSHR”). These anti-TSHR antibodies activate cells in the extraocular space that highly express TSHR, such as fibroblasts and adipocytes. Fibroblast activation causes cell proliferation and the production of hyaluronan, a substance that contributes directly to the swelling associated with TED. Hyaluronan also serves as an inflammatory signal leading to the synthesis of cytokines that cause recruitment of lymphocytes leading to extensive tissue inflammation and remodeling. Adipocyte activation leads to hyperplasia of the adipose tissue surrounding the eye causing protrusion of the eyeballs and compression of the optic nerve. Levels of anti-TSHR autoantibodies correlate positively with clinical features of TED and influence its prognosis. Exposure to other inflammatory agents, such as cigarette smoke, leads to exacerbation of the disease resulting in more severe symptoms.
In addition to anti-TSHR autoantibodies, antibodies that activate the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (“IGF1R”) may also contribute to TED. TSHR and IGF1R have functional overlaps and stimulation of either receptor may lead to activation of similar biochemical pathways implicated in TED. Published studies investing this pathway have led to the discovery that the IGF1R and TSHR form a receptor complex where IGF1R can augment the signaling of TSHR. The exact nature of the interaction between IGF1R and TSHR continues to be investigated; however, experimental evidence suggests that the effects of TSHR stimulating antibodies are only partially blocked by an IGF1R antagonist while they may be completely blocked with a TSHR antagonist.
TED has an estimated annual incidence of 9.7 in 100,000 in the U.S. and 4.8 in 100,000 in Europe. The natural history of TED begins with an inflammatory phase lasting between six and 24 months that is characterized by lymphocyte infiltration, fibroblast proliferation and increases in adipose tissue. The first line of treatment for TED patients is generally immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. Treatment of patients with immunosuppressive therapies during this active inflammatory phase can lead to reduction in symptoms and can alter the course of the disease. However, once the initial inflammatory phase is over, immunosuppressive therapies are ineffective and levels of fibrosis that have developed as the result of acute inflammation are only reversible by surgery. We estimate that 15,000 to 20,000 patients in the United States have active inflammatory TED each year and are eligible for treatment with therapy directed at the causative anti-TSHR antibodies.
Relationship between TED and Graves’ Disease
TED often develops in parallel with Graves’ disease, a related but clinically distinct autoimmune disease. In Graves’ disease, anti-TSHR autoantibodies cause the thyroid to become overactive, resulting in a condition called hyperthyroidism, in which the thyroid overproduces thyroid hormone. If left untreated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with the heart, bones, muscles, menstrual cycle and fertility.
A close temporal relationship exists between the onset of Graves’ disease and the onset of TED. Regardless of which condition occurs first, the other condition develops within 18 months in 80% of patients. Approximately one in 20 patients with Graves’ disease presents with moderate-to-severe TED characterized by swelling and redness of eyelids, proptosis, double vision and, in severe cases, corneal ulceration and decreased visual acuity. Graves’ disease can be treated with antithyroid drugs or removal of the thyroid through a procedure called a thyroidectomy. While some studies of these treatments have shown autoimmune antibodies decreasing or disappearing with treatment, others have shown no change in antibody levels after treatment.
Current Treatment Paradigm
As a first option, patients with active TED are treated with immunosuppressive therapy such as high doses of corticosteroids, typically administered intravenously or orally. Corticosteroids are not effective in all patients, and approximately one-third of patients will relapse. This therapy is associated with an increased risk of acute and severe organ damage, bone thinning, weight gain, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and depression. In January 2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics’ Tepezza (teprotumumab), an anti-IGF-1R antibody, for the treatment of TED.
Orbital radiation therapy is used as a means of reducing the infiltration of lymphocytes and can be used in conjunction with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy. Similar to these anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, radiation therapy is most effective in the active stage of TED.
Patients with moderate-to-severe active TED not responding to corticosteroids can be treated with cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil, two broad immunosuppressive drugs. These drugs are associated with numerous side effects related both to their general immunosuppressive effects as well as to inherent toxicities, such as hypertension, kidney disease and gastrointestinal toxicity.
Small case studies have identified rituximab as an alternate way of inducing immunosuppression in patients with TED. Rituximab (Roche) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen specific to B cells, leading to their destruction. However, rituximab is associated with the potential for serious side effects, such as infusion-related reactions. Rare cases of progressive multifocal encephalopathy and other viral infections have also been reported.
Surgery is considered to be a treatment option in patients with a highly active disease who have been treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy but continue to have progressive disease. The goal of surgery is to reduce the pressure causing proptosis, reduced eye movement and loss of visual acuity. Because of its invasive nature, surgery is typically reserved for inactive disease.
In 2019, we initiated an open-label, single-arm Phase 2a clinical trial of batoclimab for the treatment of TED. The majority of subjects (four of seven) evaluated at the end of treatment experienced a greater than or equal to 2-point improvement in clinical activity score (CAS). Three of seven subjects were proptosis responders; a proptosis response was defined as a greater than or equal to 2mm improvement in the study eye.
In 2019, we initiated a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of batoclimab in TED. Our voluntary pause in dosing in February 2021 resulted in unblinding this trial and the primary endpoint was not significant. However, our analysis of exploratory endpoints from this trial increased our confidence in the anti-FcRn mechanism of action for patients with TED, and they provide part of the basis for our interest in moving forward with further development of TED.
Subsequent Trial of Batoclimab in TED
We recently achieved alignment with the FDA Division of Ophthalmology to move forward in TED. We plan to initiate two Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate batoclimab for the treatment of TED in the second half of calendar year 2022. For each of the two Phase 3 trials of batoclimab in TED, we expect that approximately 100 subjects will enter the trial and be randomized to either a treatment arm or placebo arm. Subjects randomized to the treatment arm will be dosed with 680 mg of batoclimab QW for 12 weeks followed by 340 mg of batoclimab QW for 12 weeks. This batoclimab-treated group of subjects will be compared to subjects that are dosed with placebo QW for 24 weeks. This treatment period will last for 24 weeks and the primary efficacy endpoint will be measured as proptosis responders at Week 24 vs placebo where responders are defined as ≥ 2 mm reduction from baseline in proptosis in the study eye without deterioration of ≥ 2 mm increase in the fellow eye. We expect top-line results from both Phase 3 trials to be available in the first half of calendar year 2025.
Batoclimab as a Potential Treatment for Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia
Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Overview
WAIHA is a rare hematologic disease in which autoantibodies mediate hemolysis, or the destruction of red blood cells ("RBCs"). The clinical presentation is variable and most commonly includes non-specific symptoms of anemia such as fatigue, weakness, skin paleness and shortness of breath. Symptoms typically develop chronically over several weeks to months; however rapid progression over a span of days has also been observed.
In severe cases, hemoglobin levels are unable to meet the body’s oxygen demand, which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure and even death. Though the exact causes of WAIHA are unknown, roughly half of cases occur in patients with an underlying lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disease, most commonly chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus.
In WAIHA, autoantibodies react with surface proteins on RBCs at temperatures at or above 37° Celsius, or normal body temperature. These antibodies are of the IgG subtype in most patients. WAIHA is differentiated from cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or cold agglutinin disease, which shares a similar clinical presentation but is triggered by autoantibodies that react at temperatures below 37° Celsius. In WAIHA, antibody-coated RBCs are removed from circulation primarily in the spleen, where they are destroyed by macrophages. Studies have suggested the severity of WAIHA correlates with the amount and potency of autoantibodies present.
The annual incidence of WAIHA in the United States and Europe is estimated at one to three in 100,000 persons. Based on published estimates, we believe that there are approximately 40,000 patients in the U.S. and 71,000 patients in Europe living with WAIHA. The disease may be more common in females, with some sources suggesting a 2:1 female predominance. Peak incidence occurs during the sixth and seventh decades of life, however, WAIHA can occur in children as well.
Current Treatment Paradigm
High doses of corticosteroids (>1 mg/kg of prednisone) are typically the first-line treatment option for WAIHA and lead to initial disease control in approximately 70-85% of cases. Once initial disease control is achieved, doses of steroids are tapered. However, only 33% of patients maintain sustained disease control once steroids are discontinued and, as a result, the majority of patients will require either long-term steroid treatment or additional therapies.
Patients with persistent disease despite use of corticosteroids and rituximab may be offered a course of other immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine sirolimus.
RBC transfusions are indicated in patients who require immediate stabilization. Such patients are monitored closely for evidence of a transfusion reaction. In contrast to other treatment modalities that lead to nonspecific suppression of the immune system, batoclimab may offer a more targeted approach for reducing levels of the causative IgG species responsible for most cases of WAIHA. We believe this could provide a favorable therapeutic window and avoid the significant side effects associated with less targeted immunosuppression.
Subsequent Trial of Batoclimab in WAIHA
Following expected discussions with the hematology division of the FDA, we intend to initiate a randomized, placebo-controlled study of batoclimab as a treatment for WAIHA. 
Batoclimab and Atorvastatin drug-drug interaction (“DDI”) trial
In March 2022, we announced that we initiated a Phase 1 DDI study in healthy volunteers to characterize the PK profile of atorvastatin (40 mg daily (“q day”) with and without the coadministration of batoclimab 680 mg SC QW (see figure below). Key secondary objectives are to compare the change from baseline in lipid levels observed with SC QW batoclimab (680 mg or 340 mg SC) alone or in combination with varying doses of atorvastatin. Preliminary results from the initial 2 cohorts dosed in the study (680 mg SC QW with and without 40 mg atorvastatin q day) suggest that, at these doses, atorvastatin negates the batoclimab-induced increase in LDL-cholesterol. We believe, based on these preliminary data and feedback from physicians, that a batoclimab-induced increase in LDL-cholesterol can be managed with anti-lipid therapy as needed. Results from the additional cohorts studied are expected to be available by the end of calendar year 2022.

We may terminate the HanAll Agreement in its entirety without cause upon 180 days’ written notice following 30 days of discussion. Either party may terminate the HanAll Agreement upon 60 days’ written notice for uncured material breach (or 30 days in the case of non-payment), or immediately upon written notice if the other party files a voluntary petition, is subject to a substantiated involuntary petition or for certain other solvency events. 
HanAll may terminate the HanAll Agreement if we or our affiliates challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents.
Product Service Agreement and Master Services Agreement
On November 17, 2021, Immunovant, Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiary, Immunovant Sciences GmbH (“ISG”), a limited liability company formed under the laws of Switzerland, entered into a Product Service Agreement, (“PSA”), with Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd., (“Samsung”), pursuant to which Samsung will manufacture and supply us with batoclimab drug substance for commercial sale and perform other manufacturing-related services with respect to batoclimab. We previously entered in a Master Services Agreement, (“MSA”), with Samsung, dated April 30, 2021, which governs certain terms of our relationship with Samsung. Upon execution of the PSA, we committed to purchase process performance qualification batches of batoclimab and pre-approval inspection batches of batoclimab which may be used for regulatory submissions and, pending regulatory approval, commercial sale. In addition to these, we are obligated to purchase additional batches of batoclimab in the four-year period of 2026 through 2029.
The PSA will continue until the later of December 31, 2029 or the completion of the services thereunder, unless the PSA is terminated earlier. If we make a final decision to stop all development of batoclimab and all attempts to obtain regulatory approval for batoclimab, then we will have the right to terminate the PSA with 30 days’ written notice to Samsung as long as such notice is provided no later than January 2024. Upon such termination of the PSA, we will pay Samsung for non-cancellable service fees and costs that Samsung incurs and for all batches of batoclimab scheduled to be manufactured during the two-year period following such termination. In addition, either party may terminate the PSA on account of (i) the other party’s material breach of the PSA that is not cured within a specified period after the termination notice, (ii) the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy, or (iii) certain force majeure events.
As of March 31, 2022, the minimum purchase commitment related to this agreement is estimated to be approximately $36.0 million. 
We are a Member of the Roivant Family of Companies
We are a majority-owned subsidiary of RSL and have benefited from our ability to leverage the Roivant model and the greater Roivant platform. The period of time between our formation and operational maturation was shortened based on the support from centralized Roivant functions available since creation. This includes operational functions as well as access to Roivant’s proprietary technology and digital innovation platforms. Consistent with its model, Roivant has also provided us with access to an embedded team of scientific experts, physicians and technologists to help optimize clinical development and commercial strategies. In the future, we may have the ability to benefit from Roivant’s economies of scale and scope, including but not limited to the opportunity to:
•leverage Roivant’s business development engine and vast network of industry relationships for the identification of, and access to, new assets and synergistic partnerships;
•enter channel partnerships with other members of the Roivant family of companies (including but not limited to technology-focused companies built by Roivant), with the goal of delivering efficiencies in the development and commercialization process;
•access Roivant’s human capital engine to recruit new employees from within and beyond the biopharmaceutical industry;
•enable its employees to participate in Roivant’s career development program which facilitates employee mobility across members of the Roivant family of companies;
•benefit from shared learnings, best practices, and external industry relationships across the Roivant family of companies; and
•derive certain benefits of scale upon becoming a commercial-stage company.
For a description of our transactions under agreements with related parties, refer to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 – Related Party Transactions.
For a discussion on RSL’s significant ownership of our shares of common stock and related possible risks, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, “RSL owns a significant percentage of shares of our common stock and may exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.”
Sales and Marketing
We do not currently have our own marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize batoclimab or any future product candidate, if approved for commercial sale, we would have to develop a sales and marketing infrastructure. We intend to build a small, targeted sales organization in the United States, targeting specialist physicians that treat high numbers of patients with autoimmune conditions. We believe these physicians treat a majority of patients with the autoimmune indications that we intend to target and most often serve as the diagnosing and treating physicians for such indications. We may opportunistically seek strategic collaborations to maximize the commercial opportunities for batoclimab or any future product candidates inside and outside the United States.
Manufacturing
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of batoclimab, and there are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements (particularly for the development of antibodies) that might be capable of manufacturing for us. We currently rely and intend to continue to rely on contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), for both drug substance and drug product. See Product Service Agreement and Master Services Agreement above for a description of the agreements pursuant to which Samsung will manufacture and supply us with batoclimab drug substance for commercial sale and perform other manufacturing-related services with respect to batoclimab. Currently, we contract with well-established third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our drug substance and our drug product. We expect to engage additional third-party manufacturers to support any pivotal clinical trials for batoclimab as well as commercialization of batoclimab, if approved, in the United States or other jurisdictions. In addition, we continue to augment the organization by recruiting personnel with experience to manage the CMOs producing our product candidate and other product candidates or products that we may develop in the future. 
Our outsourced approach to manufacturing relies on CMOs to first develop cell lines and manufacturing processes that are compliant with cGMP then produce material for nonclinical studies and clinical trials. Our agreements with CMOs may obligate them to develop a production cell line, establish master and working cell banks, develop and qualify upstream and downstream processes, develop drug product process, validate (and in some cases develop) suitable analytical methods for test and release as well as stability testing, produce drug substance for nonclinical testing, produce cGMP-compliant drug substance, or produce cGMP-compliant drug product. We conduct audits of CMOs prior to initiation of activities under these agreements and monitor operations to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and cGMP regulations.
Competition
We expect to face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies who are developing agents for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including multiple agents which are in the same class as batoclimab. We are aware of several FcRn inhibitors that are in clinical development. These include efgartigimod (argenx SE), nipocalimab (Johnson & Johnson) and rozanolixizumab (UCB). Each of efgartigimod, nipocalimab, and rozanolixizumab is currently under development for the treatment of MG. Johnson & Johnson is currently running a Phase 2/3 clinical study for nipocalimab in WAIHA. Johnson & Johnson also announced that the FDA has granted Fast Track Designation for nipocalimab in WAIHA.
In a Phase 3 trial evaluating Subcutaneous Efgartigimod for Generalized Myasthenia Gravis, argenx reported noninferiority between subcutaneous efgartigimod and VYVGART™ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) IV based on total IgG reduction at day 29, in addition to a higher incidence of injection-site reactions compared to the IV formulation and six patients that showed worsening of their MG symptoms over the course of the study. Subcutaneous Efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology. ENHANZE® facilitates subcutaneous injection delivery of higher-volume biologics that are typically administered via infusion. In a Phase 2 trial conducted in MG, UCB’s rozanolixizumab was infused subcutaneously, over 30 minutes, and was observed to reduce mean IgG levels by approximately 56% and approximately 68% after three and six weekly 7 mg/kg infusions, respectively. In December 2021, UCB announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 MycarinG study evaluating rozanolixizumab in adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (“gMG”). Johnson & Johnson’s nipocalimab is in clinical development with a subcutaneous formulation.
In December 2021, the FDA approved VYVGART™ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for the treatment of gMG in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive. VYVGART™ is administered intravenously and represents the first-and-only FDA-approved neonatal Fc receptor blocker; and the first approved therapy designed to reduce pathogenic IgGs, an underlying driver of gMG.
Batoclimab, if approved, may also face competition from agents with different mechanisms of action. In January 2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics’ Tepezza (teprotumumab), an anti-IGF-1R antibody, for the treatment of TED. The most commonly prescribed first-line agents for the treatment of MG are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, which are marketed by several manufacturers of generic medicines. IVIg is also routinely used for patients with MG. Eculizumab (marketed by AstraZeneca), an antibody inhibitor of the C5 protein, was approved in 2017 for the treatment of generalized MG in patients who are positive for anti-AChR antibodies. The first line of treatment for TED and WAIHA patients is generally immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. Other broad immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine, are used when patients do not respond adequately to corticosteroids. Rituximab (Roche), a monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen specific to antibody-producing B cells, may also be used as a treatment for TED, WAIHA and other IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. Johnson & Johnson is developing its hypersialylated IVIg, M254, in a variety of autoimmune indications. Other product candidates in development for the treatment of MG include: zilucoplan (UCB), a peptide inhibitor of C5, and inebilizumab (Horizon Therapeutics), a CD19-targeted humanized monoclonal antibody, both of which are currently in Phase 3 trials. In December 2021, AstraZeneca announced that submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Ultomiris (Ravulizumab-cwvz), a complement inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, in gMG had been accepted for Priority Review by the FDA.
Numerous product candidates are currently in development for the treatment of WAIHA. Fostamatinib (Rigel Pharmaceuticals), a syk inhibitor, is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of WAIHA. A Phase 2 investigator-initiated study of ibrutinib (AbbVie), a BTK inhibitor, in steroid-refractory WAIHA is ongoing. Annexon Biosciences initiated a Phase 2 trial for WAIHA in 2021 for ANX005, an antibody inhibitor of the C1q protein.
Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that we may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, dosing convenience, price, coverage, reimbursement and public opinion. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors.
Accordingly, competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for any of our targeted indications by a competitor could render our product candidate non-competitive or obsolete, or reduce the demand for its product candidate before it can recover its development and commercialization expenses.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for batoclimab and any of our future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
While we seek broad coverage under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to any products we develop or processes we use may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringing our patent claims. In addition, patents, if granted, expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates.
Following our assumption of all rights, title, interest and obligations under the HanAll Agreement from RSG in December 2018, by virtue of the license of patent rights under the HanAll Agreement, ISG is the exclusive licensee of certain patents, patent applications and know-how directed to batoclimab, and certain back-up and next-generation antibodies, and products containing such antibodies, in the licensed territory. As of June 3, 2022, the in-licensed patent portfolio includes a patent family with pending patent applications and/or issued patent(s) in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, European Patent Office, Egypt, Israel, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. This in-licensed patent family discloses anti-FcRn antibodies, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, methods of treating autoimmune disease using the same, polynucleotides encoding such antibodies, expression vectors including such polynucleotides, host cells transfected with such recombinant expression vectors, methods of manufacturing such antibodies and methods of detecting FcRn in vivo or in vitro using such antibodies. Notably, in this in-licensed patent family, a U.S. patent was issued on July 2, 2019, with claims directed to an isolated anti-FcRn antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, and a pharmaceutical composition comprising such antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. Furthermore, another U.S. patent was issued in this in-licensed patent family on January 28, 2020, with claims directed to an isolated anti-FcRn antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, a pharmaceutical composition comprising such antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, as well as methods of treating various autoimmune diseases using such antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, polynucleotides and expression vectors encoding the same, host cells transfected with such expression vectors and methods of producing such antibody or antigen-binding fragment. The patents of this patent family may expire in 2035, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extension and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees. In addition, the in-licensed patent portfolio includes another patent family that discloses a pharmaceutical formulation for an anti-FcRn antibody. This patent family includes a pending international application that may be nationalized in the licensed territory in the future, as well as a pending application in Argentina, and any patent issued in this patent family may expire in 2041, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extension and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees. 
Additionally, as of June 3, 2022, independent of the licensed patent portfolio, ISG owns patent families directed to methods of treating thyroid eye disease (Graves’ ophthalmopathy) and methods of treating warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia using anti-FcRn antibodies that include patent applications in the United States as well as foreign counterparts in certain jurisdictions. Any patent issued from these patent families may expire in 2039 and 2040, respectively, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extension and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees. 
In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date, as the term of a patent granted on a utility patent application filed after June 8, 1995 expires 20 years after the non-provisional U.S. filing date (or any earlier filing date relied upon under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c)), with the timely payment of maintenance fees. In certain instances, the patent term may be adjusted to add additional days to compensate for certain delays incurred by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) in the examination process, issuing the patent and/or the patent term may be extended for a period of time to compensate for at least a portion of the time a product candidate was undergoing FDA regulatory review. However, the patent extension granted for FDA regulatory review is only applied to a single patent that covers either the product candidate or a method of using or manufacturing the same which has not expired at the time of FDA approval. Additionally, the period of time the patent is extended may not exceed five years, and the total patent term, including the period of time the patent is extended, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. The protection afforded by a patent with respect to a particular product varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in the particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent under the local laws. ISG owns a trademark for IMMUNOVANT, the corporate logo, and a composite trademark for its corporate logo with the IMMUNOVANT mark. As of May 20, 2022, this trademark portfolio includes pending trademark applications and/or registered trademarks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Under the HanAll Agreement, we have the right to market batoclimab in the Licensed Territory under the trademark(s) of our choice, subject to regulatory approval. However, upon termination of the HanAll Agreement, we must assign to HanAll all right, title and interest in and to any and all trademarks we use in the development, manufacture or commercialization of the licensed products.
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies for our product candidates or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future products may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.
Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory health authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various nonclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies and health authorities of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of batoclimab or any future product candidate.
FDA Drug Approval Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under both the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act and their implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with applicable regulations and guidance, including the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) regulations, International Council for Harmonisation (“ICH”) guidance, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated at least annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee for each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
•conduct of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), and other clinical-trial related regulations and guidance to evaluate the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for each proposed indication;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials that includes manufacturing information and substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency;
•potential FDA audit of selected clinical investigation sites, preclinical studies, and/or Immunovant as clinical trial sponsor to assess compliance with FDA’s GCP standards;
•payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies);
•agreement with FDA on the final labeling for the product and the design and implementation of any required Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”); and
•FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable, to permit commercial marketing or sale of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Our product candidates are being developed to be registered as pre-filled syringes and autoinjectors, which means that they are subject to regulation as combination products because they are composed of both a biologic product and device product. If approved and marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the biologic component of the product, which means that the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our product candidates. Accordingly, our product candidates are subject to the IND framework for premarket development and approval through the BLA pathway. Based on our understanding of FDA’s combination device expectations, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require a separate medical device authorization for the syringe, but this could change during the course of its review of any marketing application that we may submit.
European Union Drug Approval Process
In the E.U., there are a number of existing regulatory procedures for a medicinal product to be authorized for use in the Member States of the E.U. and the European Economic Area under the E.U. pharmaceutical legislation that harmonizes the regulatory standards and requirements for assessing safety, quality and efficacy.
A medicinal product for human use may be authorized either by the European Commission through the centralized procedure or by national competent authorities through a mutual recognition, decentralized or national procedure. We have focused on the centralized procedure as we expect it to be the relevant procedure for our product candidates.
The centralized procedure applies to a medicinal product for human use containing a new active substance which was not authorized in the E.U. for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of any of the following diseases: acquired immune deficiency syndrome, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder, diabetes, auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. In addition, the following product categories must also be centrally authorized: a medicinal product developed by means of recombinant DNA technology, controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes including transformed mammalian cells and hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods. A medicinal product that has been designated as an orphan medicinal product must also be evaluated through the centralized procedure. A medicinal product that is considered as constituting a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or its approval is in the interests of E.U. patients is also eligible for the optional centralized assessment. The centralized procedure requires applicants to submit an application for marketing authorization to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) which is responsible for the coordinating the scientific assessment to be performed by its relevant advisory committees, including the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Once a positive opinion is adopted by the CHMP, the European Commission will issue a binding decision on granting the centralized marketing authorization which is valid throughout the Member States of the E.U. and the European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein).
A reference medicinal product approved via the centralized procedure receives a period of 10 years data and market protection or exclusivity upon grant of a marketing authorization. This period is divided into eight years of data protection within which no generic applicant including a biosimilar applicant can cross-reference the non-clinical and clinical data contained in the file of the reference medicinal product. Even if an authorization is granted based on data cross-referencing, the follow-on manufacturer cannot market the product for two further years (the period of market protection). This period can be extended to a total period of 11 years if during the first eight years of the protection period one or more new therapeutic indications are determined, during the regulatory review, to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies and the indication application is approved.
On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) left the E.U. (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and accordingly is no longer a Member State. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which E.U. pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the U.K., which ended on December 31, 2020. A trade and cooperation agreement which outlines the trading relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. now that the transition period has concluded, applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 and formally entered into force on May 1, 2021. Since the regulatory framework in the U.K. covering the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of medicinal products is derived from E.U. regulations, Brexit has materially impacted, and could further materially impact, the regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K., as U.K. legislation now has the potential to further diverge from E.U. legislation. By way of example, the EU Clinical Trials Regulations which govern the conduct of clinical trials in the E.U. came entered into application in January 2022 and consequently do not apply in the U.K. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the U.K. in the long-term. As the U.K. is no longer an E.U. Member State, the U.K.’s participation in the European Medicines Regulatory Network has ceased and the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has assumed the functions that were previously undertaken by the E.U. for human medicines on the U.K. market (with the exception of Northern Ireland, which, pursuant to the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland has remained aligned with E.U. regulations). 
The MHRA offers new assessment procedures for applications for products containing new active substances and biosimilars. The procedures can lead to a marketing authorization in Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales), the United Kingdom, or Northern Ireland, depending on the procedure and pre-existing authorizations, as further explained below. The new assessments include:
•     The European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure will be in place until January 1, 2023 and is a targeted assessment of new applications for products containing new active substances or biosimilars under review via the centralized procedure with EMA. MHRA will review the application, CHMP assessment report, and applicant responses to CHMP within 67 days. Should that review be successful, it will lead to the grant of a marketing authorization in Great Britain, the centralized marketing authorization in the E.U. will already permit the marketing of the relevant product in Northern Ireland;
•    A full assessment as a national authorization can be chosen for new active substances, with a timeline of no more than 150 days (excluding clock-off periods where further information is requested) which can lead to the grant of a marketing authorization in Great Britain, the U.K., or Northern Ireland. If the application includes Northern Ireland then it must comply with the relevant E.U. requirements; 
•    The Unfettered Access Procedure for medicines already approved in Northern Ireland via the E.U. procedures or via the Northern Ireland national route which if successful will lead to a Great Britain marketing authorization; and
•    A ‘rolling review’, for new active substances and biosimilars, which allows companies to make an application in stages, throughout the product’s development, to better manage development risk which can lead to the grant of a marketing authorization in Great Britain, the U.K., or Northern Ireland. If the application includes Northern Ireland then it must comply with the relevant E.U. requirements.
Nonclinical and Clinical Development
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The IND includes the clinical protocols and general development plan, as well as results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology and PD characteristics of the product candidate; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold until the IND sponsor and the FDA resolve the outstanding concerns or questions. The FDA also may impose clinical holds at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Submission of an IND therefore does not guarantee that FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial will be granted or that, once begun, issues will not arise that adversely impact, suspend or terminate such studies.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments and additional information such as toxicology or Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) data in support of the investigational product(s). For new indications, a separate new IND is usually required. Outside of the U.S., clinical trial applications are generally required to conduct clinical studies in each country. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or independent data monitoring committee, which provides direction for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. For purposes of BLA/MAA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined. 
•Phase 1 — The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, tolerability, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on pharmacodynamics and effectiveness.
•Phase 2 — The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3 — The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple global clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to support chronic use of a product during marketing.
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA or, in certain circumstances, mandated after approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting or in some cases to support full approval for products that are approved via an accelerated pathway as described below. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA, and IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA, other regulators, and investigators within a regulated timeframe for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. The FDA may require such testing to occur on a lot-by-lot basis in order to release product for clinical use. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA Submission, Review and Approval
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other information. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA reviews the BLA within 60 days to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the FDA does not always meet PDUFA goal dates, and the review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification or Company submissions of substantial data during the review. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions with emphasis on risk and benefit of the molecule and proposed indications, and provide a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites, preclinical studies, and/or the sponsor to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, and where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter prior to inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification, completion of other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, and/or conduct of additional preclinical studies or manufacturing activities. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may determine that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and may require additional clinical testing or safety information.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed, which could limit the commercial value of the product. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product, and could include medication guides, healthcare professional and/or patient communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA will evaluate if any labeling or risk management plans are necessary to ensure safe use of the product in the targeted patient population and indication. Once approved, the FDA has the authority to withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre-and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may impose post-marketing requirements and commitments such as additional manufacturing data or testing; additional preclinical data or evaluation; additional clinical data from Phase 3 studies (e.g. long-term extension data); and may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval may be eligible for FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy and accelerated approval.
A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review designation means the FDA’s goal under PDUFA is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review). To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation is intended to facilitate development and expedite review of a product, and also provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team. The FDA may also review complete sections of the BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the entire application is submitted, if the sponsor and FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. The review clock generally does not begin until the final section of the BLA is submitted.
In addition, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA will take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a validated surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than survival or irreversible morbidity and is reasonably likely to predict an effect on survival, irreversible morbidity or another clinical benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA requires the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing confirmatory clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Approval may be withdrawn if the confirmatory study does not verify the anticipated clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which the sponsor must plan to provide all commercial materials and seek approval prior to the launch of the product.
In May 2022, the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research announced the launch of a new program for expediting the development of new treatment options for rare diseases called the Accelerating Rare Disease Cures (“ARC”) Program. Through the ARC Program, the FDA hopes to engage with different stakeholders, including patients, caregivers, advocacy groups, academics industry, and other partners, to address the unmet medical needs of patients living with rare diseases.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review and approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or automatically shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Orphan exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. A designated orphan product may not receive orphan exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Similarly, in the E.U., the European Commission grants binding decision on orphan designations after a satisfactory scientific assessment provided by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products. To qualify for orphan designation, a medicinal product must meet the following criteria set out in E.U. Orphan Medicinal Products Regulation:
•it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating;
•the prevalence of the condition in the E.U. must not be more than 5 in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and
•no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
The orphan designation granted is re-assessed at the time when the marketing authorization is granted in order to confirm whether the statutory criteria continue to be met. If the criteria are no longer met, then the orphan designation is removed.
If the orphan designation is maintained when the marketing authorization is granted, then the orphan medicinal product will receive 10-year orphan market exclusivity in respect of the approved indication. This exclusivity period prevents a similar medicinal product being accepted by the E.U. regulatory authorities for approval for the same indication. This exclusivity period can be extended to a total period of 12 years under the E.U. Pediatric Regulation in lieu of six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate, if certain requirements are met. The orphan exclusivity is run in parallel with the basic regulatory data/market protection or exclusivity period of 10 years in the E.U. However, the period of orphan exclusivity can be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met where it is shown on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Following the U.K.’ s departure from the E.U. there is no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation in Great Britain. Instead, orphan designation is applied for at the same time as applying for a marketing authorization. While the criteria for gaining orphan designation remain effectively the same in Great Britain as in the European Union, the designation will be based on the prevalence of the relevant condition in Great Britain.
The 10 years market exclusivity from competition from similar products in the approved orphan indication would be retained. If criteria for orphan status are met, this incentive would be awarded following grant of a U.K. marketing authorization. Similar to the E.U., orphan medicines which are authorized in Great Britain with the results of studies from a pediatric investigation plan included in the product information are eligible for an additional 2 years of market exclusivity.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FDASIA amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”), within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs.
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”), a drug or biologic product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study or studies in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a study or studies within a defined timeframe.
In the E.U., a sponsor is required to obtain an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) which describes a program of pediatric studies to generate meaningful data to inform the use of the product in the pediatric population. The data derived from the PIP must be submitted with the marketing authorization application unless a waiver or a deferral is granted. Otherwise, the application will not be accepted by the EMA for review. If the pediatric data required by the PIP are submitted, irrespective of whether the data have led to approval of a pediatric indication, the orphan exclusivity period is extended to a total period of 12 years. For a product which is not an orphan medicinal product, the supplementary protection certificate can be extended to a further six months under the E.U. pediatric rules. For a medicinal product which is no longer protected by a subsisting patent, a pediatric use marketing authorization can be sought and upon approval, a period of 10 years regulatory data exclusivity or protection is granted.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, mandated modification of promotional materials or issuance of corrective information, issuance by FDA or other regulatory authorities of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warnings or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions, consent decrees or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and misbranding. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including monetary penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication (or thirty days in advance of their first use if approved via the accelerated approval pathway). Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“Affordable Care Act”) signed into law in 2010 includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe, but no interchangeable biologic has been approved in the United States. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to the review and approval of biosimilars.
Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
In the E.U., a biosimilar product is approved under a different regulatory pathway, recognizing that a biosimilar product does not meet the conditions set out in the definition of a generic medicinal product owing to in particular differences relating to raw materials or differences in manufacturing processes of the biological medicinal product and the reference biological medicinal. In view of these differences, a biosimilar is required to provide the results of appropriate comparative clinical and non-clinical studies with the reference biological medicinal product to demonstrate that the biosimilar is both highly similar to the reference product (notwithstanding natural variability inherent to all biological medicines) and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and the reference medicine in terms of safety, quality, and efficacy. However, the biosimilar manufacturer is not required to replicate the testing results or trial data contained in the dossier of the reference biological medicinal product. 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation and oversight by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) or other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments and regulatory authorities. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. Our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may be subject to healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and transparency, and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to certain of these laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and, for example, prescribers, purchasers, third party payors, pharmacies, and pharmacy benefit managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from the reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The exceptions and safe harbors are interpreted narrowly by enforcement authorities, and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending any product payable by the federal health care programs may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, where an arrangement does not clearly meet the terms of an applicable exception or safe harbor, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on prudential factors that authorities, including the HHS of Inspector General, utilize to determine whether a particular arrangement poses a risk of fraud and abuse to the federal health care programs (e.g., increasing costs to government payors). Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, and we cannot rule out the possibility that enforcement authorities, including the Office of Inspector General, could scrutinize our practices in the future.
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) (discussed below).
The federal false claims laws, including the FCA, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or “qui tam” actions, and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been, and continue to be, prosecuted under these laws, among other things, for various conduct. For example, enforcement has pursued manufacturers allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, and also for causing false claims to be submitted because of the marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes that were added by HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
If we were to enter into a “business associate” relationship with a “covered entity” (“covered entities” being group health plans, certain healthcare providers, and “healthcare clearinghouses”), we would be subject to the HHS regulations related to data privacy, security and security breach notification under the Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA (Title II, Subtitle F of HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”). Those regulations authorize the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, attorneys’ fees and costs. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”) within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
Many states have similar statutes or regulations to the above federal laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor (i.e., are not exclusive to government payors). We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and/or state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, drug pricing or marketing expenditures. These laws may differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicating compliance efforts.
We are subject to the Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”) enacted by the U.S. government, which requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription biologic at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period from its enactment on November 27, 2013. In addition, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution. Compliance with DSCSA and current and future U.S. federal or state electronic pedigree requirements could require significant capital expenditures, increase our operating costs and impose significant administrative burdens. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Additionally, to the extent that we have business operations in foreign countries or sell any of our products in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including Canada or the E.U., we may be subject to additional regulation.
Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and results of operations.
Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security 
Because our business involves the collection, use, storage, and transmission of personal information, we are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security. Such laws may include Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), and the European Union’s ePrivacy Directive. Countries around the world have adopted or are proposing similar laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, and we may become subject to them as we expand our operations into new geographic markets. 
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which Immunovant may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which Immunovant receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance.
Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, which decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan;
•safe, effective and medically necessary;
•appropriate for the specific patient;
•cost-effective; and
•neither experimental nor investigational.
We cannot be sure that coverage or reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval.
We may develop products that, once approved, may be administered by a physician, and these products also may have difficulty obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement levels based on payor cost sensitivities and the potential application of formulary management controls (e.g., step edits through alternative therapies). Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to closely evaluating their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult given the potential cost sensitivities often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. It is not clear that third party payors will accept the pharmacoeconomic benefits of products that we commercialize, and we also may need to undertake detailed studies of any therapies that we commercialize in order to demonstrate their pharmacoeconomic benefits, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective for certain patients, including depending on the nature of the FDA approvals that we may receive. There is no assurance of coverage or adequate reimbursement for our products under either government programs or from commercial payors. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the E.U., governments influence the price of biopharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to establish their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become a close focus of government and state regulators. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement rates are attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future, which could have a downward pressure on our commercialization efforts.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the Affordable Care Act provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23% and 13% of the Average Manufacturer Price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price;
•a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
•extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
•a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
•expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
•a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
•requirements to report certain financial arrangements with certain healthcare providers and teaching hospitals;
•a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
•establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending; and
•a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
Since its enactment, there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. By way of example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the Affordable Care Act will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. On February 10, 2021, the Biden administration withdrew the federal government’s support for overturning the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. It is unclear how the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act. In addition, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation on the U.S. healthcare industry is also unclear.
Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. These Medicare sequester reductions were suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the former Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the former Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempted to implement several of the administration's proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The implementation of this rule has been delayed until January 1, 2026. Further, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump's Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles.
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to COVID-19.
We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding safe working conditions, environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Human Capital
Our Vision and Culture
We are driven by our vision of enabling normal lives for patients with autoimmune diseases. We champion an environment where all feel a sense of belonging by promoting a creative and collaborative workplace that leads to genuine connection and innovation. As a diverse workforce, we are committed to inclusion and equity across race, gender, age, religion, physical ability, identity, sexual orientation, and experience. Together, our vision and strength as a team are driven by our values focused on accountability to patients, constantly adapting to drive toward our vision and inviting all voices to bring powerful ideas to life. We believe if our employees are well aligned with our values and culture, they will be highly engaged, which will support their performance and impact on the organization.
Employees
As of June 3, 2022, we had 124 full-time permanent employees, primarily in the United States. Of these employees, approximately 52% have advanced degrees including but not limited to Ph.D., M.D., M.B.A., and approximately 75% were engaged in research and development activities. More than half of our workforce, as well as our senior management team, is comprised of women. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have not had any work stoppages. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
As the clinical development of our product candidates progresses, we also expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of clinical development, quality, regulatory affairs and, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, sales, marketing, reimbursement and distribution. In addition, we also expect to hire additional personnel in order to sustain operations as a public company.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purpose of our equity incentive plan is to attract, retain, and motivate our employees, non-employee directors, and consultants through the granting of stock-based compensation and performance cash awards. Our cash bonus awards are based on Company and departmental progress toward key annual goals and employee performance.
Response to COVID-19
We are focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees.  With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the best interest of the safety of our employees, we transitioned to a remote work model in March 2020 and our workforce continues to work remotely. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we hired a considerable number of employees and effectively onboarded talent through the remote work environment. We gained significant experience in hiring, onboarding and operating under a remote work environment. This valuable experience has enabled us to enhance our recruitment strategies by targeting high-potential talent based primarily on technical capabilities, skills, experience level and cultural alignment, regardless of geographic location. We believe our access to a broader talent pool will continue to contribute to our effectiveness in working in a remote environment.
