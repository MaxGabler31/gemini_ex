Item 1. Business
Overview
BMC Stock Holdings, Inc. is one of the leading providers of diversified building products and services in the U.S. residential construction market. Our objective is to provide best-in-class customer service and value-added products to our customers, which are primarily single- and multi-family home builders and professional remodelers. Our product offerings include lumber and lumber sheet goods and an array of value-added products, including millwork, doors, windows and structural components such as engineered wood products (“EWP”), floor and roof trusses and wall panels. Our whole-house framing solution, Ready-Frame®, which is one of our fastest growing product offerings, saves builders both time and money and improves job site safety. We also offer our customers important services, such as design, product specification, installation and installation management.
The 19 states in which we operate accounted for approximately 67% of 2018 U.S. single-family housing permits according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Our primary operating regions include the South and West regions of the United States (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), with a significant portion of our net sales derived from markets within Texas, California and Georgia. Given the local nature of our business, we locate our facilities in close proximity to our key customers and often co-locate multiple operations in one facility to increase customer service and efficiency.
The Company is a Delaware corporation and its common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol “BMCH.”
All references to “BMC,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to BMC Stock Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
Our Customers
We serve a broad customer base across 45 metropolitan areas in 19 states that includes a mix of large-scale production homebuilders, custom homebuilders, multi-family builders and professional repair and remodeling contractors. Our largest 10 customers accounted for approximately 21% of our 2018 net sales, with no single customer accounting for more than 6% of our 2018 net sales. Our largest customers comprise primarily large production homebuilders, including publicly traded companies such as D.R. Horton, Inc., Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc., Lennar Corporation, PulteGroup, Inc., Toll Brothers, Inc. and TRI Pointe Group, Inc. In addition to these large production homebuilders, we also service and supply regional and local custom homebuilders. We also serve professional residential remodeling contractors and multi-family and light commercial contractors in most of our markets.
Our Products and Services
We provide a wide variety of building products and services directly to homebuilder and professional contractor customers. We offer a broad range of products sourced through a network of suppliers with whom we have strategic supplier agreements. These products are available through our distribution locations and eCommerce platform and, in most instances, are delivered to the job site. We manufacture floor trusses, roof trusses, wall panels, stairs, specialty millwork, windows and pre-hung doors. We have developed several proprietary capabilities to design, pre-cut, label and bundle lumber and lumber sheet goods into customized framing packages, which we have branded Ready-Frame®. We also provide an extensive range of installation services and special order products.
We group our building products and services into four product categories: (i) structural components, (ii) lumber and lumber sheet goods, (iii) millwork, doors and windows, and (iv) other building products and services. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our sales of structural components and millwork, doors and windows products represented 43% of net sales. Each of these categories includes both manufactured and distributed products. Products in these categories typically carry a higher gross margin than lumber and lumber sheet goods and other building products and services, and provide us with opportunities to cross-sell other products and services. Information regarding net sales by product category for each of the last three fiscal years is set forth in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Structural components.    Structural components are factory-built substitutes for job-site framing and include floor trusses, roof trusses, wall panels and EWP that in many cases we design and cut for each home. Roof trusses, floor trusses and wall panels are built in a factory controlled environment. Engineered floors and beams are cut to the required size and packaged for the given

application at many of our locations. Without structural components, builders construct these items on site, where weather and variable labor quality can negatively impact construction cost, quality and installation time.

In addition to increased efficiency and improved quality, a primary benefit of using structural components is shortening cycle time from start to completion, eliminating job-site waste and clutter and minimizing the amount of skilled labor that must be sourced for a job site.
Lumber and lumber sheet goods.    Lumber and lumber sheet goods include dimensional lumber, plywood and oriented strand board (“OSB”) products used in on-site house framing. 
Millwork, doors and windows.    The millwork, doors and windows products category includes interior and exterior doors, windows, interior trim, custom millwork, moldings, stairs and stair parts, and cabinetry, among other products. We pre-hang interior and exterior doors in many of our markets, which consists of attaching hinges and door jambs to a door slab, thereby reducing on-site installation time and providing a higher quality finished door unit than those constructed on site. Selecting, designing and managing the procurement of the proper window package for performance and architectural reasons is a key service provided by our employees. 

Other building products and services.    Other building products and services consist of various products, including hardware, wood boards, gypsum, insulation, roofing, siding and flooring. This category also includes design assistance and professional installation services of products spanning most of our product categories. Through our installation services program, we offer scheduling, supplier and subcontractor management, and other services to many of our customers. We also provide professional estimating, product advisory and product display services that assist homebuilders and their clients in selecting the appropriate mix of products to meet their needs.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing facilities and related design capabilities are utilized to improve quality, cost and service to our homebuilder and repair and professional remodeling customers. We utilize specialized assembly and manufacturing technology and various design software packages in our manufacturing and assembly activities. Additionally, we have implemented, and continue to implement, automated manufacturing technology in certain markets. We manufacture and assemble products within two of our product categories: structural components and millwork, doors and windows.
Sales and Marketing
We seek to attract and retain customers through customer service, product quality, a range of product and service offerings and competitive pricing. This strategy is centered on building and maintaining strong customer relationships. We strive to add value for homebuilders through solution-based selling, improved product selection and procurement processes, lower material costs and general project coordination and support.
Our experienced sales and service professionals advise the homebuilder or contractor in areas such as opportunities for cost optimization, increased building or project efficiencies, new products and regional product preferences. The team coordinates a sequence of site deliveries with the customer. Our large delivery fleet and inventory management systems enable us to provide “just-in-time” product delivery. We believe this level of service is valued by our customers and generates customer loyalty. At January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 1,000 sales professionals.
Materials and Supplier Relationships
We purchase inventory primarily for distribution, some of which is also utilized in our manufacturing plants. The key materials we purchase include dimensional lumber, OSB, EWP, windows, doors and millwork. Our largest suppliers are national lumber and wood products producers and distributors such as Boise Cascade Company, Hampton Lumber, LP Building Products, Interfor Corporation, Norbord Inc., West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. and Weyerhaeuser Company and building products manufacturers such as James Hardie Industries plc, JELD-WEN Holding, Inc., Masonite International Corp., Metrie Inc. and MI Windows and Doors, LLC. We believe there is sufficient supply in the marketplace to source most of our requirements without reliance on any particular supplier and that our diversity of suppliers affords us purchasing flexibility. We also work with our suppliers to ensure that we have sufficient adaptability and flexibility to service our customers’ needs as they evolve and as their markets grow. For certain customers, we institute purchasing programs on raw materials such as OSB to align portions of our procurement costs with our customer pricing commitments. We balance our lumber and OSB purchases with a mix of contract and spot market purchases to ensure consistent quantities of product necessary to fulfill customer contracts, to source products at the lowest possible cost and to minimize our exposure to the volatility of commodity lumber prices.

We currently source products from over 2,000 suppliers in order to reduce our dependence on any single company and to maximize purchasing leverage. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no supplier accounted for more than 10% of our total materials purchases. We believe we are one of the largest customers for many of our suppliers and therefore have significant purchasing leverage.
Competition
The lumber and building materials (“LBM”) distribution industry in the United States is highly fragmented, with a number of retailers and distributors offering a broad range of products and services. Demand for our products is largely driven by the level of activity in the U.S. residential construction market, particularly in single-family new construction, which has experienced improving demand trends influenced by job growth, consumer confidence, market demographics, levels of household formations, interest rate levels, inventories of available housing units and other external factors. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, from 2005 to 2011, single-family housing starts in the United States declined by approximately 75% to 0.43 million, which was significantly less than the 50-year average rate of approximately 1.0 million per year. Following several challenging years, single-family housing starts increased on a year-over-year basis each year from 2012 to 2018, with starts in 2016, 2017 and 2018 reaching 0.78 million, 0.85 million and 0.87 million, respectively. 
We primarily compete in the professional building contractor segment of the U.S. residential new construction building products supply market (the “Pro Segment”). Our customers primarily consist of professional homebuilders and those that provide construction services to them. The principal methods of competition in the Pro Segment are developing long-term relationships with professional builders and retaining such customers by delivering a full range of high-quality products on time and offering trade credit, competitive pricing, flexibility in transaction processing, and integrated service and product packages, as well as offering value-added products and services such as structural components and installation. Our market positions in the highly competitive Pro Segment create economies of scale that allow us to supply our customers cost-effectively, which both enhances profitability and reduces the risk of losing customers to competitors. Approximately 11.6% of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 were to professional residential remodeling contractors. Competition in the professional remodeling segment includes other distributors, as well as home center retailers such as The Home Depot, Inc. and Lowe’s Companies, Inc. 
We have and will continue to experience competition for homebuilder business. Many of our competitors are predominantly small, privately owned companies, local and regional materials distributors, single or multi-site lumberyards, and truss manufacturing and millwork operations. Many of these companies have limited access to capital and lack sophisticated IT systems and large-scale procurement capabilities. We believe we have substantial competitive advantages over these smaller competitors due to our long-standing customer relationships, local market knowledge, integrated supply chain and competitive pricing. We also face competition from large national lumber and building materials companies. For example, our largest competitors in our local markets often include one or more of 84 Lumber Co., Builders FirstSource, Inc., Carter Lumber Company and US LBM Holdings, LLC.
Employees
At January 31, 2019, we had approximately 9,500 full-time equivalent employees, approximately 230 of whom were represented by unions. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Seasonality and Other Factors
Our first and fourth quarters have historically been, and are generally expected to continue to be, adversely affected by weather patterns in some of our markets, causing reduced construction activity. In addition, quarterly results historically have reflected, and are expected to continue to reflect, fluctuations from period to period arising from the following factors, among others: 

• | the volatility of lumber prices;


• | the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry;


• | general economic conditions in the markets in which we compete;


• | the pricing policies of our competitors;


• | the production schedules of our customers; and


• | the effects of weather.

History
On December 1, 2015, Stock Building Supply Holdings, Inc. (“SBS” or “Legacy SBS”) completed a business combination with privately-held Building Materials Holding Corporation (“BMHC” or “Legacy BMHC”) in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 2, 2015, by and between SBS and BMHC (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which BMHC merged with and into SBS (the “Merger”). As a result of the business combination, SBS survived the Merger and in connection therewith changed its name to BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.
BMHC was created in 1987 and initially operated approximately 20 lumber and building materials distribution facilities located in the West. BMHC grew primarily through acquisitions and expanded its footprint throughout the South and West regions of the United States.
SBS’s predecessor was founded as Carolina Builders Corporation in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1922 and began operating under the Stock Building Supply name in 2003. In addition, certain companies acquired by SBS were founded as early as 1822. On August 14, 2013, SBS completed its initial public offering.

We possess an array of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, trade names, proprietary technology and know-how and other proprietary rights that are important to our brand and marketing strategy. In particular, we maintain registered trademarks for BMC® and the BMC logo, Fortis® and Artrim®, two of our private label lines, and our Ready-Frame® system. In addition, we maintain registered trademarks for the trade names under which certain of our local branches operate. While we do not believe our business is dependent on any one of our trademarks, we believe that our trademarks are important to the development and conduct of our business as well as the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect all of our intellectual property rights.
Regulation and Legislation
We are subject to various federal, state and local government regulations applicable to the business generally in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, work place safety, transportation, zoning, business, environmental, contractor licensing and fire codes. We strive to operate each of our distribution, manufacturing, retail and service facilities in accordance with applicable laws, codes and regulations.
Transportation and Work Place Safety. Our operations in domestic interstate commerce are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation (“DOT”), which has broad administrative powers with respect to our transportation operations. We are subject to safety requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the DOT. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also are subject to both federal and state regulation. Our operations are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), which has broad administrative powers with respect to workplace and jobsite safety. Our operators are also subject to state and federal labor laws regulating hours worked and compensation paid.
Environmental. Our operations and properties are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, release, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, substances and wastes and relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, including off-site disposal locations, stormwater and other run-off and similar issues. We have not incurred material costs in the past to comply with environmental laws and regulations. However, we could be subject to material costs, liabilities or claims relating to environmental compliance in the future, especially in the event of changes in existing laws and regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement.
As current and former owners, lessees and operators of real property, we can be held liable for the investigation or remediation of contamination on or from such properties, in some circumstances regardless of whether we knew of or caused such contamination. Our current expenditures with respect to environmental investigation and remediation at our facilities are immaterial, although no assurance can be provided that more significant investigation and remediation will not be required in the future as a result of spills or releases of petroleum products or other hazardous substances or the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions, or changes in legislation, laws, rules or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement.
To date, costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources have not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not become more stringent in the future or that we will not incur costs in the future in order to comply with such laws and regulations. We did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls in fiscal year 2018 and do not anticipate material capital expenditures in this regard in fiscal year 2019.

Business. Our suppliers are subject to various laws and regulations, including in particular laws and regulations regulating labor, forestry and the environment. We consult with our suppliers as appropriate to confirm they have determined they are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Generally, our suppliers agree contractually to comply with our expectations concerning environmental, labor and health and safety matters.
Products that we import into the United States are subject to laws and regulations imposed in conjunction with such importation, including those issued and/or enforced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In addition, certain of our products are subject to laws and regulations relating to the importation, acquisition or sale of illegally harvested agricultural products and the emissions of hazardous materials. We work closely with our suppliers to help ensure material compliance with the applicable laws and regulations in these areas.
