Overview
FTD Companies, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (referred to herein as the “Company,” “FTD,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a premier floral and gifting company with a vision to be the world’s floral innovator and leader, creating products, brands, and technology-driven services our customers love. We provide floral, specialty foods, gift and related products and services to consumers, retail florists, and other retail locations and companies in need of floral and gifting solutions. Our business uses the highly recognized FTD® and Interflora® brands, both of which are supported by the iconic Mercury Man® logo.

Today, the “Mercury Man” is one of the most recognized logos in the world, and we are one of the largest e-commerce floral and gift retailers in the world. Our diversified portfolio of brands also includes ProFlowers®, Shari’s Berries®, Personal Creations®, Flying Flowers®, Gifts.com™, and ProPlants®. While floral arrangements and plants are our primary offerings, we also market and sell gift items, including gourmet-dipped berries and other specialty foods, personalized gifts, gift baskets, wine and champagne, jewelry, and spa products.

About FTD
In 1910, thirteen American retail florists, led by John Valentine, agreed to exchange orders for out-of-town deliveries. In telegraphing orders to each other from opposite sides of the country, they hoped to eliminate their reliance on trains to send flowers to far away recipients. At the time, lengthy transit times made sending flowers to friends and relatives in distant locations almost impossible. The flowers could not survive the long journey. Soon independent florists all over America were telegraphing and telephoning orders to each other using the FTD network. They found that, by working together, they were able to make the seemingly impossible, possible. For the first time, beautiful bouquets could be made and personally hand-delivered anywhere in the country within a day. The idea revolutionized the way flowers could be sent; customers could now mark special occasions with flowers from afar. Originally called “Florists’ Telegraph Delivery Association,” FTD was the world’s first flowers-by-wire service. In 1914, FTD adopted the Roman messenger god as its logo, and the Mercury Man has ever since been our iconic logo. In 1965, FTD expanded to include international transactions, and the company was renamed “Florists’ Transworld Delivery” to reflect its growing worldwide presence.
Not surprisingly, it was not long before florists outside of the U.S. wanted to provide the same delivery service to distant locations. In the U.K., a nursery owner from Essex and a florist in Glasgow brought the concept to the U.K., and in 1923, Florists’ Telegraph Delivery Association launched in the U.K. In the 1950s, the name Interflora was adopted, which is one of the most recognized brands in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. FTD acquired Interflora British Unit (“Interflora”) in 2006. Our Interflora brand recognition within the U.K. flower delivery market has the highest prompted awareness when compared to our competitors based on a survey completed in January 2019 by Aurora Market Research. In 2012, Interflora acquired certain assets of the Gifts Division of Flying Brands Limited, including the Flying Flowers business.
On December 31, 2014, we acquired from a wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail, Inc. (“Qurate”), formerly Liberty Interactive Corporation, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Provide Commerce, Inc. (the “Acquisition”). Provide Commerce, Inc. (“Provide Commerce”) was founded in 1998 under the name ProFlowers, Inc. In 2003, ProFlowers, Inc. changed its name to Provide Commerce, Inc. Subsequent to its initial public offering in 2003 and prior to its acquisition by Qurate in 2006, Provide Commerce was an independent, publicly traded company. At December 31, 2018, Qurate holds 36.0% of the outstanding shares of FTD common stock. For additional information and risks associated with the Acquisition and Qurate’s ownership interest in us, see “Risk Factors,” which appears in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
FTD Companies, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois that was formed in April 2008 in connection with United Online Inc.’s (“United Online”) acquisition of FTD Group, Inc. (“FTD Group”). FTD Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of FTD Companies, Inc., is a Delaware corporation that was formed in 2003 by a private investment fund affiliated with Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. solely for the purpose of acquiring majority ownership of FTD, Inc. FTD, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of FTD Group, is a Delaware corporation that commenced operations in 1994 when FTD converted from a not-for-profit cooperative to a for-profit corporation. FTD, Inc.’s principal operating subsidiaries are Florists’ Transworld Delivery, Inc., FTD.COM Inc., Interflora, and Provide Commerce.

On November 1, 2013, FTD Companies, Inc. became an independent, publicly traded company on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “FTD.” Prior to November 1, 2013, FTD was a wholly owned subsidiary of United Online. On November 1, 2013, as a result of a spin-off, United Online separated into two independent, publicly traded companies: FTD Companies, Inc. and United Online, Inc. (the “Separation”). The Separation was consummated through a tax-free dividend involving the distribution of all shares of FTD common stock to United Online’s stockholders. 
Recent Events
In July 2018, we announced that our board of directors initiated a review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value, including but not limited to, a sale or merger of the Company, pursuing value-enhancing initiatives as a standalone company, or the sale or other disposition of certain of our businesses or assets. 
In addition, in July 2018, we announced a corporate restructuring and cost savings plan, under which we identified opportunities to optimize our operations, drive efficiency, and reduce costs. Under this plan, we currently expect to generate approximately $25.0 million to $28.0 million in annualized run-rate cost savings in 2019. In conjunction with the corporate restructuring and cost savings plan, we currently expect to incur restructuring and corporate reorganization costs ranging between approximately $28.0 million and approximately $32.0 million. During the second half of 2018, we incurred restructuring costs of $18.2 million, which included employee severance costs to be paid in cash of $12.7 million and non-cash stock-based compensation related to the acceleration of certain equity awards of $5.5 million. Other costs associated with the corporate reorganization and cost savings plan, such as consulting fees and costs to retain key employees, are currently expected to range from approximately $10.0 million to approximately $12.0 million, of which $7.0 million was incurred during the second half of 2018.
Also in July 2018, our board of directors appointed Scott D. Levin, our then-current Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, as interim President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Levin succeeded John C. Walden, who stepped down from these positions and from our board of directors. On November 2, 2018, our board of directors appointed Mr. Levin President and Chief Executive Officer. On December 7, 2018, our board of directors appointed Mr. Levin as a director.
As detailed in Footnote 6—“Financing Arrangements,” during the year ended 2018, we entered into several amendments to the Credit Agreement (as defined herein) with our lenders. These amendments, among other things, restricted combined usage of the credit facility portion of the Credit Agreement, modified measurement dates and the required ratios for the consolidated net leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenant tests and updated fees.
On March 13, 2019, the Company entered into the Seventh Amendment to Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement, as previously amended and as further amended by the Seventh Amendment, the “Amended Credit Agreement”) with our lenders. The Amended Credit Agreement includes, among other terms, a minimum Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) covenant; further limitations on capital expenditures; a covenant requiring that, on or before June 1, 2019, the Company shall consummate one or more transactions (i) that would permit the Company and its subsidiaries to continue as a going concern, which must provide for the repayment in full of the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement no later than June 1, 2019, or (ii) from which all or substantially all of the aggregate net cash proceeds are used to repay obligations and permanently reduce the commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement; and updated limits on our combined usage of the revolving credit facility portion of the Credit Agreement throughout its remaining term. In addition, the consolidated net leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants were deleted for the period ending March 31, 2019 and subsequent periods. For additional information regarding the Amended Credit Agreement see Footnote 6—“Financing Arrangements.”

Industry Background 
Our consumer brands operate within the gifting industry. The gifting market is estimated to be greater than $100 billion annually in the U.S. (excluding cash and gift cards) according to a Unity Marketing report from 2015. 
Floral Industry
This market’s floral gifting segment, including self-purchase, accounts for roughly $12 billion annually within the gifting market, based on estimates from the Society of American Florists. In the U.K., floral industry retail purchases, including fresh-cut flowers and indoor plants, were over £2 billion in 2014, according to a study by Mintel, a market research company.

Both the U.S. and U.K. markets are highly fragmented, with thousands of floral industry participants that can be grouped into three broad channels:

• | Floral Mass Marketers: This channel, which includes our ProFlowers, FTD.com, and Interflora businesses, captures floral orders from consumers through websites, associated mobile sites and applications, and telephone. Floral mass marketers’ share of floral gifting has expanded due to shifting consumer preferences towards purchasing floral products online and through mobile sites and applications as well as the emergence of prominent brands with national or international reach. Increasing consumer interest in floral arrangements shipped directly to consumer recipients via common carrier has also benefited floral mass marketers.


• | Retail Florists: There were approximately 13,400 retail florists in the U.S. in 2018, the number of which has been declining in recent years, according to Dun & Bradstreet’s 2018 industry profile. Supermarkets, mass merchants, and other retailers have established or increased their presence in the floral gifting market by adding a variety of floral and related gift products to their merchandise assortments. The growth of supermarkets and mass merchants as important distribution channels within the floral gifting market has led many traditional retail florists to expand their merchandise offerings to include a larger selection of gift items, outdoor nursery stock, and seasonal decorations, among other items.


• | Supermarkets and Mass Merchants: Supermarkets, mass merchants, and other retailers continue to increase their presence in the floral gifting market by adding a variety of floral and related gift products to their product offerings.

Complementary to these channels, floral wire services are able to transmit orders to their specific network of retail florists for fulfillment. These orders include the aforementioned online and telephone orders made by end consumers as well as those placed by other florists. Floral wire services may offer a broad range of services to florists in their network, such as order transmission, clearinghouse services, marketing, and other business-to-business services, to promote these florists’ revenue growth and facilitate the efficient operation of their businesses. Order clearinghouse services ensure the flow of payment between a floral network member sending an order received from a consumer and the member receiving and fulfilling the order, thereby eliminating counterparty credit risk for the floral network members. Traditional retail florists often rely on floral network services to provide incoming order volume.
Specialty Food and Gift Industry
As described above, the total U.S. gifting market was estimated at greater than $100 billion annually in 2015 (Unity Marketing Gifting Report 2015) and is highly fragmented with consumers purchasing gifts for a broad array of occasions in both retail stores and online. In 2015, according to Unity Marketing, over 50% of consumers purchased gifts online, which increased from 39% in 2010.
Food gifting sales were projected to approach $20 billion in 2018, according to the “Food Gifting in the U.S.,” March 2018 study by Packaged Facts. Consumers view gourmet foods as relevant for a number of different gifting occasions including traditional holidays such as Valentine’s Day, winter holidays, and Mother’s Day as well as everyday gifting occasions such as “Thinking of You,” “Birthday,” and “Congratulations” events based on data from a consumer survey commissioned by us and conducted by a third-party in 2017. According to Packaged Facts’ research, of the food gifts purchased, boxed chocolates/candies remain the most prevalent gift for others totaling 28% of purchases during the twelve-month period tested. Other commonly purchased food gifts include sweet baked foods, coffee/tea/hot chocolate gifts, and nut/salty foods.
Personalized gifts are also important to consumers as they look to purchase a special, memorable gift for others. Personalized gifting in the U.S. in 2017 approximated $5.6 billion and is forecasted to be one of the faster growing markets, growing to $7.4 billion in 2020 based on the “Global Personalized Gifts Market for 2017-2021” report by Technavio.com. Consumers may purchase personalized gifts for a variety of reasons, but primarily for the winter holidays, new baby, and weddings and anniversaries, based on data from a consumer survey commissioned by us and conducted by a third-party in 2017.

Our Business Strategy 
Our vision is to be the world’s floral innovator and leader, creating products, brands, and technology-driven services our customers love. In 2018, we launched our long-term strategic growth plan to attain these goals through the following key components:

• | Strong Disruptive Brand that Earns the Trust and Wins the Hearts of Consumers: Our extensive range of fresh-cut flowers, floral arrangements, and plants provides our customers with innovative offerings in expressing life’s most important sentiments. We offer exclusive products by FTD, Interflora, ProFlowers, Shari’s Berries, and Personal Creations, and other exclusive products designed with our strategic partners. Our premium and branded floral gift products include FTD Luxe Collection, FTD Color Confection Collection, USO® Collection, and DaySpring®, among others. Any third party trademarks are the property of their respective owners. 

We also seek to provide higher value offerings to our customers, which may, for example, include bundled floral and gift product offerings. In addition, we believe our ability to acquire and retain customers effectively is critical to our success. We continue to seek expansion of our business by, among other things, marketing to our current and potential consumer and floral network customers. Our marketing efforts are primarily focused on generating orders from new and existing customers; increasing the value of our offerings to our customers thereby increasing average order value; increasing the penetration of sales of our services and products to our floral network members; attracting new members to our floral networks; and marketing our products and services to alternative channels such as supermarkets, mass merchants, and other retail locations. 
We believe that building greater awareness of our brands and communicating brand differentiation, both within and beyond the existing customer base, are important for growth. We promote our brands through a variety of traditional and digital marketing and promotional techniques, including online, social, print, radio, email, direct mail, public relations, and television.
In an effort to acquire and retain consumers, we engage in multi-channel, integrated marketing efforts, which include online advertising and marketing, including search engine marketing and optimization; social media and group-buying programs; co-marketing and affiliate partnerships and loyalty programs such as airlines and other corporate and travel companies; email promotions to existing consumer customers; direct mail and other forms of print advertising; an email-based reminder service that provides consumers with personalized reminders of occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, and key gift-giving holidays; and radio, public relations, television, and other offline advertising. 
As consumer shopping continues to migrate from computers to mobile devices, we are committed to providing the best shopping experience from all types of devices. We have reignited an enterprise-wide focus on this, launching new mobile-first, customer-centric websites and supporting the ongoing optimization with a strong, cross-functional team.
We believe that by continuing to offer innovative product and service offerings and delivering high-quality, consistent products to consumers, we can improve end-to-end customer experience and, in turn, increase customer loyalty, thereby enabling growth. We offer our customers a satisfaction guarantee for fresh, beautiful floral arrangements, plants, and gifts. We seek to offer a compelling customer experience through mobile, web or voice interactions. We also strive to deliver a high-caliber customer service to our consumer customers, floral network members, and other customers. We operate customer service centers at our headquarters in Downers Grove, Illinois; in San Diego, California; in other locations in the U.S. and U.K.; and in outsourced locations. High-quality products, superior customer experiences, and excellent customer service are critical to our brand strength and brand loyalty.
As part of our business strategy, we intend to continue to expand the breadth of our brands through organic growth and, where appropriate, through the acquisition of complementary businesses. We will explore opportunities to differentiate our floral and gift branded product offerings with a mind to providing customers greater options in expressing life’s most important sentiments.

• | Network of Strong Partnerships with the World’s Best Florists: Maintaining strong relationships with our floral network members is key to our success. We have both customer and supplier relationships with our florist network members. To maintain high standards among our floral network members, we have member training programs and a quality assurance program to review and test the quality offered by our floral network members. We believe that our florist network members have the blend of skills, creativity, and attention to detail needed to create unique and special handmade arrangements. Further, our floral network members have important roles in supporting our brands. We believe that the partnership between FTD and our member florists is and should be based on a mutually beneficial value proposition. Just as we seek to partner with the highest quality florists, we also strive to provide them with high quality products and services, including local websites, order processing, hard goods, order flow, and marketing services as examples, to help their business thrive. 

Broader engagement efforts related to our floral network members include member appreciation and training events, sponsorship and participation in floral and retail industry trade shows, and offline media campaigns. In addition, many of our consumer marketing efforts are also designed to integrate with and enhance the businesses of our floral network members. By enhancing the FTD and Interflora brands, we increase the possibility that a consumer will place an order directly with one of our floral network members since floral retailers frequently highlight their association with our floral networks in their own marketing efforts. We also employ dedicated sales forces to market our products and services to our floral network members and to encourage other floral retailers to buy floral and gift products and services from us.

• | High-Quality, Low Cost, Market Leading Fulfillment Capabilities: We believe a key differentiator for our brands is delivering high-quality, consistent products and services to our customers. Having strong relationships with quality suppliers is crucial to the success of our platforms. To maintain high standards, we have established quality assurance programs to review and test our suppliers on an ongoing basis. We continue to work with suppliers to explore new methods to preserve quality and freshness, ensure a diverse product offering, maintain efficient technology, and reduce costs. In addition, we regularly seek out new suppliers to provide the broadest available selection of quality products for the benefit of our customers. Our extensive flower selection is largely sourced from Colombia, the U.S., Kenya, Holland, Ecuador, Thailand, and Costa Rica. In addition, our strawberries are largely sourced from the U.S. and Mexico. Further, we offer a variety of delivery options, including same-day delivery to the U.S. and the U.K., next-day and future-day delivery service throughout the world (subject to certain limitations), and three-hour, as well as morning and afternoon delivery options in the U.K. 

Our fulfillment model includes independent retail florists, company-operated distribution facilities that ship product directly to our customers, and third-party suppliers who also ship directly to our customers. Further, we are part of an international network with over 30,000 floral shops displaying our iconic Mercury Man logo, enabling consumers to purchase products for delivery in more than 125 countries. We continue to optimize our distribution network, enabling us to deliver our products to customers in a high-quality manner while improving the efficiency of our fulfillment and logistics operations.

• | Complementary Non-Floral Categories: In addition to our floral and floral-related products, we also offer additional items, including gourmet-dipped berries and other specialty foods, personalized gifts, wine and champagne, jewelry, and spa products. These items provide innovative offerings for expressions of sentiment to help best deliver on a customer’s gifting needs, and they are shipped directly to a recipient in a gift box. We assemble or personalize many of our products in our company-operated facilities, with the remainder processed by third-party suppliers.

Reportable Segments
We report our business operations in three operating and reportable segments: U.S. Consumer, Florist, and International. Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company reported its business in four reportable segments. As a result of a change in the information provided to and utilized by the Company’s then-current Chief Executive Officer (who was also the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”)) to assess the performance of the business, the Company combined the previous Provide Commerce and Consumer segments into one reportable segment, our U.S. Consumer segment. Our Florist segment includes the Florist business. Our International segment includes the Interflora business. Our current CODM, Mr. Scott D. Levin, continues to receive and utilize information provided for these three segments to assess the performance of the business. For additional information about our reportable segments refer to the MD&A and Footnote 2—“Segment Information.”

Segment revenues from external customers, as a percentage of total revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
U.S. Consumer | 70 | % | | 71 | % | 71 | %
Florist | 15 | % | | 15 | % | 15 | %
International | 15 | % | | 14 | % | 14 | %
Total revenues | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Competition
Consumer market. The consumer market for flowers and gifts is highly competitive and fragmented, as consumers can purchase the products we offer from numerous sources, including traditional local retail florists, supermarkets, mass merchants, gift retailers, floral and gift mass marketers, specialty markets, and other online retailers. We believe the primary competitive factors in the consumer market are strength of brand, price, quality of products, selection, fulfillment capabilities, customer service, website performance, and ordering convenience. In the U.S., our key competitors include online floral and gift retailers, including such companies as 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., and certain mass merchants. In addition, the specialty foods category is also highly competitive and fragmented, with competition from online retailers, specialty companies, and certain mass merchants. Further, we compete with personalized gift retailers as well as mass merchants and other general gift companies which also offer personalized products.
Floral network services market. The floral network services market is also highly competitive, and retail florists and supermarkets may choose from a variety of providers that offer similar products and services. In addition, the number of retail florists has been declining over a number of years. As the number of retail florists declines, competition for the business of the remaining retail florists may intensify. We believe the primary competitive factors in this market are price, order volume, customer service, services offered, strength of brand, and fulfillment capabilities. Our key competitors in the U.S. floral network services market include providers of online or e-commerce services, retailers and wholesalers of floral-related products, and other floral network services providers, such as Teleflora and BloomNet Wire Service, a subsidiary of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. However, other non-florist retail locations and other companies may continue to expand their floral and gifting offerings.
International market. We face strong competition in the consumer markets in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland, with similar trends and competitive factors as those seen in the U.S. The markets in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland are also large and highly fragmented. Key competitors in the international consumer market include mass market retailers, grocery chains, online retailers, and specialty gift retailers. We also face competition in the business-to-business market for floral network services.
Although we believe that we can compete favorably with respect to many competitive factors, in both the consumer and the floral network services markets, some of our competitors may have an advantage over us with respect to certain factors. Some of our competitors may engage in more aggressive pricing, may devote significantly greater resources to marketing campaigns or other aspects of their business, or may respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities or customer requirements.
Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our revenues, operating results, and cash flows across our businesses typically exhibit seasonality. Revenues, operating results, and cash flows tend to be lower for the third quarter because none of the most popular floral and gift-giving holidays, which include Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day, Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving, fall within that quarter. In addition, depending on the year, Easter and the U.K. Mother’s Day sometimes fall within the first quarter and sometimes fall within the second quarter. Furthermore, depending on the year, certain of the most popular floral and gift-giving holidays, such as Valentine’s Day, may occur on a weekend or government holiday, which historically has negatively impacted orders. Our 
10

ProFlowers and Gourmet Foods businesses experience a greater level of seasonality and have historically generated an operating loss and used cash for operations during the third quarter. Historically, a significant portion of the revenues and operating profit of these businesses have been generated in the first half of the year. Our Personal Creations business is also highly seasonal with approximately half of its revenues and substantially all of its operating profits generated in the fourth quarter during the winter holiday season. As a result of these variations, we believe that comparisons of our revenues and operating results for any period with those of the immediately preceding period, or in some instances, the same period of the preceding fiscal year, may be of limited relevance in evaluating our historical performance and predicting our future financial performance. Our working capital and any short-term borrowings may also fluctuate during the year as a result of the factors described above.
Revenue Sources
We generate revenues primarily from the sale of products and services, as further described below:

• | Products revenues. Products revenues are derived primarily from selling floral, gourmet-dipped berries and other specialty foods, personalized gifts, and other gift items to consumers and include the related shipping and service fees. Products revenues also include revenues generated from sales of fresh flowers, branded and non-branded containers, packaging and promotional products, and a wide variety of other floral-related supplies to floral network members. Products revenues are recognized upon delivery of the product to the customer. 


• | Services revenues. Services revenues related to orders sent through the floral network are variable based on the number of orders and/or on the value of orders and are recognized in the period in which the orders are delivered. Services revenues also include monthly membership and other subscription-based fees from floral network members that are recognized as earned, on a month-to-month basis. 

International Operations
We have international operations primarily in the U.K. through which we provide floral, gift, and related products and services to consumers and to floral network members and other companies in need of floral and gifting solutions in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland.
We also have a wholly owned subsidiary in the Republic of India, FTD India Private Limited. Our operations in India are primarily responsible for technology development and support. We do not generate revenues directly from our operations in India. For information regarding risks associated with our international operations, see “Risk Factors,” which appears in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. For information regarding international long-lived assets, see Footnote 2—“Segment Information.”

Technology
Our floral network services use internally-developed order processing, order transmission, message processing, and customer service systems which provide communication to our floral network members and third-party suppliers. We also have developed reliable and secure e-commerce, supply chain, customer relationship, and transaction processing systems utilizing custom-built and third-party technologies, and have developed software to enhance the functionality of certain components of our services, including billing, email, customer support, logistics, and fulfillment for floral and gift products. We have multiple systems and platforms currently in place related to many of these technologies.
For all systems, we maintain data centers in multiple locations in the U.S. and the U.K. In most cases, we have redundant systems to provide high levels of service availability and connectivity. We host some of our data center services in third-party co-location facilities.

In addition to our proprietary technology, we license from third parties a number of our software applications and components, including applications for our customer support, as well as some of our client and server applications. These licenses generally have terms ranging from several years to perpetual.
Government Regulations
We are subject to a number of international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those relating to taxation, bulk email or “spam” advertising, user privacy and data protection, food production, safety, storage, marketing and distribution, consumer protection, supply chain operations, anti-bribery, labor, antitrust, and unclaimed property. In addition, proposed laws and regulations relating to some or all of the foregoing, as well as to other areas affecting our businesses, are continuously debated and considered for adoption in the U.S. and other countries, and such laws and regulations could be adopted in the future. For additional information regarding risks related to international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, see “Risk Factors” which appears in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Proprietary Rights
Our trade names, trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade secrets, and other intellectual property are important to the success of our business. We consider our trade names and trademarks, including the Mercury Man logo, FTD, Interflora, ProFlowers, Shari’s Berries, Personal Creations, Flying Flowers, Gifts.com, and ProPlants to be very valuable assets. Most of these trademarks have been registered in the U.S., the U.K. and/or, in certain cases, in other countries. We principally rely upon patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, domain name laws, and contract laws to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We also license rights to use some of our intellectual property, including the Mercury Man logo, to third parties. We continuously assess whether to seek patent and other intellectual property protections for those aspects of our business and technologies that we believe constitute innovations providing competitive advantages. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, and corporate partners, and generally seek to control access to, and distribution of, our technologies, documentation, and other proprietary information. Additionally, we hold a patent relating to certain manufacturing techniques. We also have pending patent applications relating to certain products and manufacturing techniques. Patents are generally valid for 14-20 years as long as their registrations are properly maintained. If the patents for which applications have been pending for numerous years are issued, the length of their validity may be shortened.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,333 employees, of which 975 were located in North America, 239 were located in the U.K., and 119 were located in India. In addition, we utilize part-time and temporary employees to respond to fluctuating seasonal demand around holidays and peak periods. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
