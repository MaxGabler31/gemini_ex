Through our experience in developing and delivering solutions for our clients, we believe we have acquired domain expertise that differentiates our firm. We use project teams that deliver high-value, measurable results by working collaboratively with clients and their partners through a user-centered, technology-based and business-driven solutions methodology. We believe this approach enhances return on investment for our clients by reducing the time and risk associated with designing and implementing technology solutions.
 
We serve our clients from locations in multiple markets throughout North America and through domestic and global delivery centers by leveraging an experienced sales team that is connected through a common service portfolio, sales process, and performance management system. Our sales process utilizes project pursuit teams that include those colleagues best suited to address a particular prospective client’s needs. Our primary target client base includes companies in North America with annual revenues in excess of $500 million. We believe this market segment can generate the repeat business that is a fundamental part of our growth plan. We primarily pursue solutions opportunities where our domain expertise and delivery track record give us a competitive advantage.
 
During 2017, we continued to implement a strategy focused on: expanding our relationships with existing and new clients; continuing to make disciplined acquisitions by acquiring substantially all of the respective assets of RAS & Associates, LLC (“RAS”), in January and Clarity Consulting, Inc. and Truth Labs, LLC (together, “Clarity”), in June; expanding our technical skill and geographic base through the acquisitions of RAS and Clarity; expanding our brand visibility among prospective clients, employees, and software vendors; leveraging our offshore capabilities in India and China; and leveraging our existing (and pursuing new) strategic alliances by targeting leading business advisory companies and technology providers. Approximately 98% of our revenues were derived from clients in the United States during each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Approximately 94%, 95% and 96% of our total assets were located in the United States as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with the remainder located in Canada, India, China, and the United Kingdom.
 
We have been able to extend or enhance our presence in certain markets through acquisitions, as well as expand or enhance the services and solutions we are able to provide our clients. Our acquisition of RAS on January 3, 2017 enhanced and expanded the Company’s management consultancy in strategy, operations and business process optimization expertise in the Denver, Colorado market. Our acquisition of Clarity on June 22, 2017 enhanced and expanded the Company’s management consultancy in custom development, cloud implementation, and digital experience design on Microsoft platforms and devices and enabled us to deepen our penetration in the Chicago, Illinois market.
 
We provide services primarily to the healthcare (including pharma and life sciences), financial services (including banking and insurance), automotive and transport products, retail and consumer goods, manufacturing, electronics and computer hardware,  telecommunications,  business services, leisure, media and entertainment, and energy and utilities markets.

We specialize in service-oriented architecture, application program interfaces (“APIs”), business process management, event-driven architecture, complex event processing, master data management, and enterprise application integration, often using these technologies together to modernize legacy application architecture and support multi-channel user experiences such as portals, B2B (business to business) APIs, social media and mobility applications.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Business Process Management (“BPM”). BPM combines people, process and technology to improve organizational performance and customer value.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
 The market for the services we provide is competitive and has low barriers to entry. We believe that our competitors fall into several categories, including:
 
  
• | small local consulting firms that operate in no more than one or two geographic regions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | boutique consulting firms, such as Prolifics and Avanade;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | national consulting firms, such as Accenture, Deloitte Consulting, Publicis.Sapient, EPAM Systems, and Globant;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | digital consulting firms/entities such as Accenture Interactive, Deloitte Digital, SapientRazorfish, Edgewater, and Computer Task Group;

• | in-house professional services organizations of software companies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | offshore providers, such as Infosys Technologies Limited, Cognizant and Wipro Limited.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 4
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market include domain expertise, track record and customer references, partner network with leading technology companies, quality of proposed solutions, service quality and performance, efficiency, reliability, scalability and features of the software platforms upon which the solutions are based, and the ability to implement solutions quickly and respond on a timely basis to customer needs. In addition, because of the relatively low barriers to entry into this market, we expect to face additional competition from new entrants. We expect competition from offshore outsourcing and development companies to continue.
 
Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger client bases, greater name recognition, and possess significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to attract customers to which we market our services and adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer or industry requirements.
  
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 3,024 employees, 2,362 of which were billable (excluding 216 billable subcontractors) and 446 of which were involved in sales, administration, and marketing. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage. We are committed to the continued development of our employees.
 
 Sales and Marketing. As of December 31, 2017, we had a 101-person direct solutions-oriented sales force. We reward our sales force for developing and maintaining relationships with our clients, seeking follow-up engagements, and leveraging those relationships to forge new relationships in different areas of the business and with our clients’ business partners.  Approximately 86% of our services revenues are executed by our direct sales force.  In addition to our direct sales team, we also have 51 dedicated sales support employees, 39 general managers and 9 vice-presidents who are engaged in our sales and marketing efforts.
 
We have sales and marketing partnerships with software vendors including IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, and Magento. These companies are key vendors of open standards-based software commonly referred to as middleware application servers, enterprise application integration platforms, business process management, cloud computing applications, business activity monitoring and business intelligence applications, and enterprise portal server software. Our direct sales force works in tandem with the sales and marketing groups of our partners to identify potential new clients and projects. Our partnerships with these companies enable us to reduce our cost of sales and sales cycle times and increase win rates by leveraging our partners’ marketing efforts and endorsements.


Talent Acquisition. We are dedicated to hiring, developing, and retaining experienced, motivated technology professionals who combine a depth of understanding of current Internet and legacy technologies with the ability to implement complex and cutting-edge solutions. We believe in an employee-centered environment that is built on a culture of respect.
 
 Retention. We firmly believe in the power of partnership and the spirit of innovation and approach every opportunity with these philosophies in mind. We focus on a core set of digital experience, business optimization, and industry solutions, applications, and software platforms and our commitment to our employees’ career development through continued training and advancement opportunities sets us apart as an employer of choice.
 
Compensation. Our compensation philosophy and programs are designed to attract, retain, motivate and reward employees based on performance and results. Our tiered incentive compensation plans help us reach our overall goals by rewarding individuals for their influence on key performance factors and allow for differentiation so that truly stellar performers may be rewarded.
