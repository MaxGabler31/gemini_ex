The Company products are sold through a global distribution network of established audio/video equipment retailers that have been selling the Simlatus products for approximately 20 years.
 
Simlatus Corporation (SIML or Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name Sunberta Resources Inc. on November 15, 2006, as a mining and exploration of mineral claims business.  On November 18, 2009, the Company changed its name to Grid Petroleum Corp. and continued with the mining and exploration of mineral claims operations, exploring mining claims in Alberta, Canada, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, England and the United States.
 
On March 9, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement) with RJM and Associates, LLC, a California limited liability company (RJM) whereby RJMs owners became the directors of the Company and were to be issued $6,250,000 worth of the Companys stock; $5,000,000 of Restricted Common Stock 90 days from the date of this agreement and $1,250,000 of Preferred Series-A Shares of the Companys Preferred Stock.

The Company did not recognize goodwill or any intangible assets in connection with the transaction. All costs related to the transaction are being charged to operations as incurred. The $6,250,000 worth of shares of Company stock, to be issued in conjunction with the transaction, was presented as a liability until such time that the shares were issued and the liability reduced. The historical financial statements include the operations of the accounting acquirer for all periods presented.
