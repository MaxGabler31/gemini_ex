Item 1. Business.
(a) Business Development
 Ultimate Holdings Group, Inc. (we, us, our, or the "Company") was incorporated by Thomas DeNunzio on July 30, 2021 in the State of Nevada.
 
The Company intends to serve as a vehicle to affect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business.
On July 30, 2021, Thomas DeNunzio was appointed Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Director of Ultimate Holdings Group, Inc.
 
The Company has elected July 31st as its fiscal year end.
 
We use home office space of our sole officer and director at no cost.
 
The Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company seeks to serve as a vehicle to pursue a business combination and has made no efforts thus far to identify a possible business combination. As a result, the Company has not conducted negotiations or entered into a letter of intent concerning any target business. The business purpose of the Company is to seek the acquisition of or merger with an existing company.
 
The Company is an “emerging growth company” (“EGC”), that is exempt from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act), that eases restrictions on the sale of securities; and increases the number of shareholders a company must have before becoming subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC’s) reporting and disclosure rules (See Emerging Growth Companies Section Below).
 
(b) Business Summary
 
The Company, based on proposed business activities, is a "blank check" company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) defines those companies as "any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51)-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies or other entity or person." Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a shell company, because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity.
 
The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.
 
The Company current business plan is to serve as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company’s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. The company may merge with or acquire another company in which the promoters, management, or promoters’ or managements’ affiliates or associates, directly or indirectly, have an ownership interest.
 
A business combination would help us grow and cease to be a shell company.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, Thomas DeNunzio, the sole officer and director of the Registrant. As of this date, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company. The Registrant has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Registrant will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

(a) | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Registrant or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(e) | The cost of participation by the Registrant as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(f) | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------


(g) | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and,
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(h) | Other relevant factors.
----+------------------------

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Registrant's limited capital available for investigation, the Registrant may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.

Additionally, Ultimate Holdings Group, Inc. will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with and acquisitions of business entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies which may be a merger or acquisition candidate for Ultimate Holdings Group, Inc. Nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than Ultimate Holdings Group, Inc. and, consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. Moreover, Ultimate Holdings Group, Inc. will also compete with numerous other small public companies in seeking merger or acquisition candidates.
 
We currently have no shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
 In the future we may issue shares of our common stock. Shares of our common stock which are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but are held by shareholders, cannot be sold under the exemptions from registration provided by Rule 144 under or Section 4(1) of the Securities Act (“Rule 144”) so long as the Company is designated a “shell company” and for 12 months after it ceases to be a “shell company,” provided the Company otherwise is in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations. Compliance with the criteria for securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely complex, especially in respect of those exemptions affording flexibility and the elimination of trading restrictions in respect of securities received in exempt transactions and subsequently disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or state securities laws.
 If the Company engages in a registration statement offering our securities for sale as a blank check company or with a company that would still be considered a shell company or blank check company, our securities will require registration subject to Rule 419. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a rule (Rule 419) which defines a blank check company as (i) a development stage company, that is (ii) offering penny stock, as defined by Rule 3a51-1, and (iii) that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies. Should we file a registration statement offering of our securities for sale before we complete a business combination with an operating company, the Company would be considered a blank check company within the meaning of Rule 419 and any sales of the stock issued in the offering would require a registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, furthermore, the registered securities and the proceeds from an offering subject to Rule 419 require the following:
 

a) | Deposit and investment of proceeds
---+-----------------------------------

 
All offering proceeds, after deduction of cash paid for underwriting commissions, underwriting expenses and dealer allowances, and amounts permitted to be released to the registrant shall be deposited promptly into the escrow or trust account; provided, however, that no deduction may be made for underwriting commissions, underwriting expenses or dealer allowances payable to an affiliate of the registrant.
 

b) | Deposit of securities
---+----------------------

 
All securities issued in connection with the offering, whether or not for cash consideration, and any other securities issued with respect to such securities, including securities issued with respect to stock splits, stock dividends, or similar rights, shall be deposited directly into the escrow or trust account promptly upon issuance. The identity of the purchaser of the securities shall be included on the stock certificates or other documents evidencing such securities.
 

c) | Release of deposited and funds securities
---+------------------------------------------

 
Post-effective amendment for acquisition agreement. Upon execution of an agreement(s) for the acquisition(s) of a business(es) or assets that will constitute the business (or a line of business) of the registrant and for which the fair value of the business(es) or net assets to be acquired represents at least 80 percent of the maximum offering proceeds, including proceeds received or to be received upon the exercise or conversion of any securities offered, but excluding amounts payable to non-affiliates for underwriting commissions, underwriting expenses, and dealer allowances, the registrant shall file a post-effective amendment disclosing the entire transaction.
 
If we publicly offer any securities as a condition to the closing of any acquisition or business combination while we are a blank check or shell company, we will have to fully comply with SEC Rule 419 and deposit all funds in escrow pending advice about the proposed transaction to our stockholders fully disclosing all information required by Regulation 14 of the SEC and seeking the vote and agreement of investment of those stockholders to whom such securities were offered; if no response is received from these stockholders within 45 days thereafter or if any stockholder elects not to invest following our advice about the proposed transaction, all funds that must be held in escrow by us under Rule 419, as applicable, will be promptly returned to any such stockholder. All securities issued in any such offering will likewise be deposited in escrow, pending satisfaction of the foregoing conditions. In addition, if we enter into a transaction with a company that would still be considered a shell company or blank check company, the exemption from registration available from Rule 144, for the resales of our securities by our shareholders, would not be available to us.
 
In addition, the ability to register or qualify for sale any shares of stock for both initial sale and secondary trading would be limited because a number of states have enacted regulations pursuant to their securities or "blue-sky" laws restricting or, in some instances, prohibiting, the sale of securities of "blank check" issuers, such as the Company, within that state. In addition, many states, while not specifically prohibiting or restricting "blank check" companies, may not register the shares for sale in their states. Because of such regulations and other restrictions, the Company's selling efforts, if any, and any secondary market which may develop, may only be conducted in those jurisdictions where an applicable exemption is available or a blue sky application has been filed and accepted or where the shares have been registered thus limiting the issuers ability to complete this offering.

Form of Acquisition
 
The manner in which the Registrant participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of the Registrant and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the Registrant and such promoters.
 
It is likely that the Registrant will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the Registrant. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called "tax free" reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other "tax free" provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 10% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity.
 
Our management anticipates that we will likely be able to affect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing.
 
We anticipate difficulty in obtaining financing from other sources since we have no income and zero cash reserves. We are presently reliant on capital contributions towards expenses from our sole officer and director, Thomas DeNunzio. Our sole officer and director has not guaranteed that he will continue to support our capital needs. Therefore, we may not have the ability to continue as a going concern.
 
The present stockholders of the Registrant will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Registrant following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, all, or a majority of, the Registrant's directors may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.
 
The Company anticipates that prior to consummating any acquisition or merger, the Company, if required by relevant state laws and regulations, will seek to have the transaction approved by stockholders in the appropriate manner. Certain types of transactions may be entered into solely by Board of Directors approval without stockholder approval.
 
Under Nevada law, certain actions that would routinely be taken at a meeting of stockholders, may be taken by written consent of stockholders having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a meeting of stockholders. Thus, if stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares decide by written consent to consummate an acquisition or a merger, minority stockholders would not be given the opportunity to vote on the issue. If stockholder approval is required, the Board will have discretion to consummate the transaction by written consent if it is determined to be in the Company’s best interest to do so. Regardless of whether an acquisition or merger is approved by Board action alone, by written consent or by holding a stockholders' meeting, the Company will provide to its stockholders’ complete disclosure documentation concerning the potential target including requisite financial statements. This information will be disseminated by proxy statement in the event a stockholders' meeting is held, or by an information statement if the action is taken by written consent.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. We estimate such cost to be approximately $15,000. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
 
We presently have no employees apart from our management, which consists of one person, our sole officer and director, Mr. Thomas DeNunzio. Our sole officer and director is engaged in outside business activities and anticipates that he will devote to our business approximately five (5) hours per week until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.
 
Furthermore, the analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, Thomas DeNunzio, the sole officer and director of the Company, who is not a professional business analyst and in all likelihood will not be experienced in matters relating to the target business opportunity. The inexperience of Mr. DeNunzio and the fact that the analysis and evaluation of a potential business combination is to be taken under his supervision may adversely impact the Company’s ability to identify and consummate a successful business combination. There is no guarantee that Mr. DeNunzio will be able to identify a business combination target that is suitable for the Company. Thomas DeNunzio, the sole officer and director of the company, may hire third parties to conduct an analysis for a target company or any other business opportunities.
 
(c) Reports to security holders.
 

(1) | The Company is not required to deliver an annual report to security holders and at this time does not anticipate the distribution of such a report.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The Company will file reports with the SEC. The Company will be a reporting company and will comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | The public may read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC in the SEC's Public Reference Section, Room 1580, 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Section by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Additionally, the SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, which can be found at http://www.sec.gov.

Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:
 

(a) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,070,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement; 
(c) the date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or 
(d) the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto. 

 
As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.
 
As an emerging growth company, we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes.
 
We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
