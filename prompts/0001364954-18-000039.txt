ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 

Chegg is the smarter way to student. As the leading direct-to-student learning platform, we strive to improve educational outcomes by putting the student first in all our decisions. We support students on their journey from high school to college and into their career with tools designed to help them pass their test, pass their class, and save money on required materials. Our services are available online, anytime and anywhere, so we can reach students when they need us most.
Our Chegg Services include Chegg Study, Chegg Writing, Chegg Tutors, Brand Partnership, Test Prep and Internships. Our Chegg Study service combines both step-by-step Textbook Solutions and Expert Answers, which help students understand and master their course work. Chegg Writing is comprised of our writing tools properties, including EasyBib, Citation Machine, BibMe, CiteThisForMe, RefMe and NormasAPA, which help students create citations for their papers. Additionally, in October 2017, we launched a service, on our BibMe writing tools property, that helps students prevent unintentional plagiarism and find grammar and spelling mistakes in their writing. For students who need additional human help, Chegg Tutors provides live online help for a wide variety of topics online, anywhere and anytime. In October 2017, we acquired Cogeon GmbH (Cogeon), a provider of adaptive math technology and developer of the math application, Math 42, which will become Chegg Math, and which leverages artificial intelligence to provide additional homework help for students specifically struggling with math. We offer unique and compelling ways for student-relevant brands to reach and engage high school and college students through our Brand Partnerships. Chegg and Kaplan Test Prep (Kaplan) have launched co-branded test prep programs, in December 2017, starting as low as $99 to provide students with an online adaptive test preparation service. Our platform also provides access to internships to help students gain skills and experiences that are critical to securing their first job. In 2017, over 2.2 million students subscribed to our Chegg Services, an increase of 45% year over year from 1.5 million in 2016.
Through our strategic partnership with Ingram Content Group (Ingram) and agreements with other partners, we offer Required Materials, which includes an extensive print textbook and eTextbook library for rent and sale, helping students save money compared to the cost of buying new. In 2017, students rented or bought over 5.4 million textbooks and eTextbooks from Chegg. 
To deliver these services, we partner with several third parties. We have a large network of students and professionals who leverage our platform to earn money by tutoring in their spare time. In 2017, we sourced print textbooks through our strategic partnership with Ingram and agreements with other partners as well as eTextbooks and supplemental materials directly or indirectly from thousands of publishers in the United States, including Pearson, Cengage Learning, McGraw Hill, Wiley and MacMillan. Further, thousands of employers leverage our platform to post their internships and jobs. In addition, because we have a large student audience, local and national brands partner with us to reach the college and high school demographic through our Brand Partnership service. 
Our Offering 
We offer products and services that help students improve their outcomes throughout their educational journey. Our offerings fall into two categories: Chegg Services, which encompasses all of our digital products and services, and Required Materials, which primarily includes our print textbook and eTextbook offering. 
Chegg Services
Chegg Study. Our Chegg Study service helps students master challenging concepts on their own. For high demand print textbooks and eTextbooks, primarily in the subjects of sciences, technology, engineering, mathematics, statistics, business and economics, we offer “Textbook Solutions,” which are step-by-step explanations that help students understand how to solve the questions at the end of each chapter in their textbooks. For non-textbook questions, we offer our “Expert Answers” service, which allows students to ask questions on our website and receive similarly detailed explanations from subject matter experts. As of December 31, 2017, Chegg had an archive of 7 million Textbook Solutions and 13 million Expert Answers, which students can immediately access through their paid subscription. These services are available on our website and on mobile devices through our native application and our mobile website.
Chegg Writing. In May 2016 we acquired Imagine Easy Solutions (Imagine Easy), the provider of the popular EasyBib, Citation Machine, BibMe, CiteThisForMe, NormasAPA and other tools with capabilities such as citation, 
4

bibliography and anti-plagiarism. When students need to cite their sources in written work, they can use our writing tools to automatically generate sources in the required formats. These tools offer a variety of advertising-supported and paid subscription products. In 2017, students logged more than 304 million individual online sessions, lasting on average more than 8 minutes per session. Since the launch of EasyBib, students worldwide have created more than 2.1 billion citations using Imagine Easy's writing productivity tools. Additionally, in October 2017, we launched a service, on our BibMe writing tools property, that helps students prevent unintentional plagiarism and find grammar and spelling mistakes in their writing.
Chegg Tutors. Complementing our other study tools, students can find human help on our learning platform through our network of live tutors. Students can access help online, anywhere, anytime, either synchronously or asynchronously. Instead of paying for expensive, offline tutors that require scheduling and travel time, students can come to Chegg to find tutors whenever they need additional help on a subject and pay as little as $0.40 per minute. Our tutors are qualified to help students with a wide range of topics, including science, technology, engineering, mathematics, business, history, foreign languages, and English literature, along with test prep and a variety of other highly-requested subjects. Students can subscribe to weekly or monthly packages, or choose to use the service on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
Chegg Math. In October 2017, we acquired Cogeon, a provider of adaptive math technology and developer of the math application, Math 42. With this acquisition, students in both high school and college will be able to get math help through self-guided and individualized math solutions. We expect to leverage Cogeon's unique A.I.-driven math technology to enhance current capabilities inside Chegg Study and expect to launch an integrated new product, Chegg Math, in the second half of 2018.
Brand Partnership. We offer unique and compelling ways for student-relevant brands to reach and engage high school and college students. Our Brand Partnership service includes digital advertising on our platform, product samples, white label integrations, discounts, and other promotions shipped directly to students in our distinctive orange Chegg boxes and experiential offerings that may include, for example, on-campus events, sponsorships and other brand ambassador work. 
Test Prep. We entered into a partnership with Kaplan in August 2017 to provide students with an online adaptive test preparation service. Chegg and Kaplan have launched co-branded test preparation programs, in December 2017, starting as low as $99. Additionally, we provide students access to Kaplan's test prep courses, practice products, and books through our website.
Internships. For students who are seeking job-ready skills through work experience before graduation, we offer our internships service. Students can search for internships, upload their resume, and apply for open positions and employers can post their internships and connect with students who are actively seeking positions. As of December 31, 2017, we provide students access to approximately 250,000 internships across the country. We currently offer internships as a free service to both students and employers.
Required Materials
Print Textbooks and eTextbooks. For students looking to save on the cost of required materials, we rent and sell print textbooks and eTextbooks. Most of the print textbook transactions are rentals, although we also offer both new and used books for sale at a slight markup to our acquisition cost. In 2014, we implemented a partnership with Ingram, which we expanded in May 2015, so that Ingram fulfills all of our print textbook rentals and sales. We have also entered into agreements with other partners to provide their textbooks for rental or sale. In participation with certain publishers, we also offer “Instant Access” to eTextbooks that is a one-week free trial of our eTextbook service, and allows the student to access the eTextbook while the print copy is in transit. All eTextbooks obtained from Chegg are accessed through the VitalSource Bookshelf which provides students with access to eTextbooks on PCs, tablets and smart phones, providing access anytime, anywhere that students are connected to the Internet and students can save a portion of the book for offline access. The eTextbook reader enables fast and easy navigation, keyword search, text highlighting, note taking and further preserves those notes in an online notepad with persistence of highlighting and notes across platforms.
Supplemental Materials. In addition to textbooks, we offer students access to other materials from publishers, professors, students and subject matter experts. These include related materials like study guides, lab manuals or digital services provided by publishers, commonly known as “Whole Course Solutions” or “Integrated Learning Systems.” We tailor our merchandising of these materials based on the student’s core textbook.
Textbook Buyback. We offer students, on behalf of our fulfillment partner Ingram, the ability to sell us their textbooks, even if they were not originally purchased from us, and in turn those textbooks are offered to other students for purchase or 
5

rent, or sold to wholesalers. If our buy-back offer to the student is accepted, we provide a pre-printed label and shipping instructions. Ingram reimburses us the amounts we pay to students for these purchases.
Technology and Platform Integration 
Our technology is designed to create a direct-to-student learning platform that will continue to enable our growth at scale. We employ technological innovations whenever possible to increase efficiency and scale in our business. Our products rely upon and leverage the information underlying our Student Graph discussed in more detail below. We will continue to invest in building technologies around our data, search and solutions. The key elements of our technology platform are: 
Personalization and Merchandising Technology. We create a personalized experience for each student throughout our learning platform, building awareness of our multiple services and also connecting them with opportunities through third-party partners and brands. We are able to accomplish this personalization and customization as a result of our Student Graph and our search technology. 
Student Graph. Our Student Graph is the accumulation of the collective activity of students in our learning platform. Students generate valuable information each time they engage with our learning platform. Our Student Graph also includes information we access from public and private sources such as textbook information, information about colleges and scholarship data. We are able to collect, organize and process this information to algorithmically create a personalized experience for each student on our network. 
Search. Search is an easy on-ramp for students to discover all of our services. Students can search by book, ISBN, author’s name or course. Many students come to us for textbook rentals, and in our search results we not only provide the relevant textbook, but also begin to build awareness of our other services. For instance, when a student searches for a textbook, we can also expose that student to relevant Chegg Study solutions and available Chegg Tutors that are knowledgeable about the searched textbook. 
Data Sourcing and Graph Technology. Not all information relevant to students on our platform is made available by service, product, list or user-input. Therefore, we have developed proprietary technologies to collect disparate, distributed sets of data. For example, we access data from public and private sources to integrate into our platform to inform our decisions about our textbook catalog and pricing. 
Mobile Solutions. We have mobile applications on Apple iOS and Google Android. Our mobile apps are built as hybrid applications leveraging the Chegg application programming interface (API) and server-side HTML5. We also maintain a mobile version of our website: m.chegg.com. Taking advantage of capabilities unique to the mobile platform, we offer some functionality on mobile that is not available on our website, such as textbook barcode scanning for price comparisons and Chegg Flashcards. 
Content Conversion Platform. We have developed a proprietary set of technologies that ingests each publisher’s unique source files and creates HTML5-based documents. The web-based eTextbook Reader we utilize, which is embedded with digital rights management, allows us to provide our content across technology platforms, have a deep understanding of how content is consumed and deliver content securely. 
Real-time Sourcing and Pricing Technologies. We have internally developed proprietary pricing and sourcing systems which consider market price, content selection and availability, and other factors, in determining price and origin of content and services we offer to students. 
Programmatic Advertising. With our acquisition of Imagine Easy, we acquired programmatic advertising technology under the brand StudyBreak Media (SBM). Through SBM, we combine a deep understanding of programmatic technology trends with data science, engineering and machine learning. The result is a mediation platform that blends with our direct sales force to maximize the value of the digital impressions we serve.

Infrastructure. Our technology resides at a major cloud-hosting provider divided between the U.S. West Coast and U.S. East Coast. We use one region for our test/development/stage/failover environment and the other for our production environment. The architecture is also designed to allow for expansion into new international markets. 
Network Security. Our platform includes encryption, antivirus, firewall and patch-management technologies to help protect our systems distributed across cloud-hosting providers and our business offices.

Internal Management Systems. We rely on third-party technology solutions and products as well as internally developed and proprietary systems, in which we have made substantial investment, to provide rapid, high-quality customer service, internal communication, software development, deployment, and maintenance. 
Our technology and development expenses were $81.9 million, $66.3 million and $59.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For more information about our technology and development expenses, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 - Technology and Development.”
Customers 
In 2017, 4.2 million individuals paid for our products and services, up from approximately 3.5 million and 3.1 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Sales and Marketing 
Students 
We use several major direct marketing channels to reach students. We deploy search engine optimization (SEO) techniques designed to increase the visibility of Chegg.com content in organic, unpaid search engine result listings. We supplement our SEO efforts through search engine marketing using keyword simulation and bid management tools to analyze and categorize search keywords, optimize bidding, increase impressions and drive conversion. We also drive brand awareness through the use of streaming radio and display advertising on major online and mobile advertising networks, such as Google Display Network. We integrate our textbook services on affiliates’ websites and work with a large advertising network that recruits individual online affiliates in exchange for pre-determined revenue share or commissions. We utilize three types of email marketing campaigns: onboarding programs to drive activation and retention, personalized cross-sell campaigns to deepen engagement, and promotional campaigns to drive sales and interests. We use social media to manage organic and paid programs across top websites, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. We also acquire and engage students through content generated by student bloggers, syndicated through partners, around key student concerns and interests such as admissions, transition to college, picking a major, and resume preparation. Through our campus activation programs, we partner with brands and influencers to bring entertainment events, such as concerts, trial promotions, and product giveaways to students. 
Colleges and Brands 
We secure contracts with brands through direct sales by our field sales organization, which sells brand advertising services to large brand advertisers and advertising agencies seeking to reach and engage college and high school students. This team has field sales people and inside client success managers as well as operations and marketing support. In January 2017, we signed a strategic alliance agreement with NRCCUA. Under this agreement, we provide fulfillment services for digital targeting products which NRCCUA sells to colleges and universities. 
Student Advocacy 
We are committed to providing a high level of customer service to our students. We trust our students, understand the critical role our products and services have in their education, and strive to resolve all problems quickly and thoroughly. Our student advocacy team can be reached directly through phone, email, and online chat during business hours. We also proactively monitor social media to identify and solve problems before we are otherwise informed of their existence. We endeavor to respond to students’ concerns within five minutes. 
Competition 
While we do not have any competitors that compete with us across our business in its entirety, we face significant competition in each aspect of our business. The actual and potential competition in each of our primary areas of operations is described below. 
Products and Services for Students. Our Chegg Services face competition from different businesses depending on the offering. For Chegg Study, our competitors primarily include publishers that provide study materials and 
7

online instructional systems. Additionally, we face competition from free services such as Yahoo! Answers and Brain.ly for our Expert Answers service. For our Chegg Writing service, we primarily face competition from other citation generating services such as Noodle Tools. For our Chegg Tutors services, we face competition from other online tutoring services such as Wyzant, Tutors.com and Varsity Tutors. The market for textbooks and supplemental materials is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We face competition from college bookstores, some of which are operated by Follett and Barnes & Noble Education, online marketplaces such as Amazon.com and providers of eTextbooks such as Apple iTunes and Blackboard, as well as various private textbook rental websites. Many students purchase from multiple textbook providers, are highly price sensitive and can easily shift spending from one provider or format to another. As a consequence, our Required Materials product line, which includes eTextbooks, competes primarily on price and further on selection and functionality and compatibility of the eTextbook Reader we utilize across a wide variety of desktop and mobile devices.
Brands Advertising. With respect to brands, we compete with online and offline outlets that generate revenues from advertisers and marketers, especially those that target high school and college students. In this area, we seek to partner with brands that have offerings that will interest or delight students and have received very positive comments and feedback from students on these offerings. We provide these brands with preferential access to our audience, which we believe represents a highly engaged portion of the target demographic of our brand partners.
We believe that we have competitive strengths, some of which are discussed above, that position us favorably in each aspect of our business. However, the education industry is evolving rapidly and is increasingly competitive. A variety of business models are being pursued or may be considered for the provision of digital learning tools, print textbooks and eTextbooks, some of which may be more profitable or successful than our business model. 

Intellectual Property 
We use proprietary technology to operate our business and our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 20 patents which will expire between 2032 and 2037 and 18 patent applications pending in the United States. We own three U.S. copyrights registrations and have unregistered copyrights in our software documentation, marketing materials and website content that we develop. We own the registered U.S. trademarks “Chegg,” “Chegg.com,” “Chegg Study,” “Chegg for Good,” “Student Hub,” “internships.com,” “Research Ready,” “EasyBib” and “#1 In Textbook Rentals,” among others as well as a variety of service marks. As of December 31, 2017, we owned over 600 registered domain names. We also have a number of pending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions and unregistered marks that we use to promote our brand. From time to time we expect to file additional patent, copyright and trademark applications in the United States and abroad. 
Government Regulation 
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and in the education industry, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the Internet and students in general and how they will relate to our business in particular, are often unclear. For example, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the e-commerce and online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, defamation, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, financial aid, scholarships, student matriculation and recruitment, quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement. 
Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States, and in some cases internationally, that have a direct impact on our business and operations. For example: 
The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws adopted by a number of states, regulate unsolicited commercial emails, create criminal penalties for emails containing fraudulent headers and control other abusive online 
8

marketing practices. Similarly, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has guidelines that impose responsibilities on us with respect to communications with consumers and impose fines and liability for failure to comply with rules with respect to advertising or marketing practices they may deem misleading or deceptive. 
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) restricts telemarketing and the use of automated telephone equipment. The TCPA limits the use of automatic dialing systems, artificial or prerecorded voice messages, SMS text messages and fax machines. It also applies to unsolicited text messages advertising the commercial availability of goods or services. Additionally, a number of states have enacted statutes that address telemarketing. For example, some states, such as California, Illinois and New York, have created do-not-call lists. Other states, such as Oregon and Washington, have enacted “no rebuttal statutes” that require the telemarketer to end the call when the consumer indicates that he or she is not interested in the product being sold. Restrictions on telephone marketing, including calls and text messages, are enforced by the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, states and through the availability of statutory damages and class action lawsuits for violations of the TCPA. 

The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, or CARD Act, and similar laws and regulations adopted by a number of states regulate credit card and gift certificate use fairness, including expiration dates and fees. Our business also requires that we comply with payment card industry data security and other standards. In particular, we are subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. 

Regulations related to the Program Participation Agreement of the U.S. Department of Education and other similar laws and regulate the recruitment of students to colleges and other institutions of higher learning.


The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act imposes additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In addition, certain states, including Utah and Massachusetts, have laws that impose criminal penalties on the production and distribution of content that is “harmful to a minor.” 
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) provides relief for claims of circumvention of copyright protected technologies and includes a safe harbor intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for hosting, listing or linking to third-party content that infringes copyrights of others. 
The Communications Decency Act provides that online service providers will not be considered the publisher or speaker of content provided by others, such as individuals who post content on an online service provider’s website. 
Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we had 893 full-time employees. We also engage temporary, seasonal employees and consultants. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Seasonality

Information about seasonality is set forth in the section “Seasonality of Our Business” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Information about Segment and Geographic Revenues 
Information about segment and geographic revenues is set forth in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
