ITEM 1.
 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
Overview

Historically we have operated as a digital media holding company for online assets primarily targeted to the military and public safety sectors. We are dedicated to providing those that keep us safe places to go online where they can do everything from staying current on news and events affecting them, look for jobs, share information, communicate with the public, and purchase products. In addition to our corporate website, we own and/or manage 25 websites which are customized to provide our niche users, including active, reserve and retired military, law enforcement, first responders and other public safety employees with products, information and news that we believe may be of interest to them. We also own an ad network, Daily Engage Media, which was acquired in September 2017. We have placed a particular emphasis on providing quality content on our websites to drive traffic increases. Our websites feature timely, proprietary and aggregated content covering current events and a variety of additional subjects targeted to the specific demographics of the individual website. Our business strategy requires us to continue to provide this quality content to our niche markets and to grow our business, operations and revenues both organically and through acquisitions.

While we have had significant losses (a significant part of which was non-cash) since inception, these losses were anticipated and tied to the strategy described herein. We have invested in our infrastructure and acquisitions and placed an emphasis on providing quality content on our websites necessary to drive traffic to our websites. With the acquisition of Daily Engage Media and the recent completion of its RTB (real time bidding) exchange platform, we intend to launch the Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network in the third quarter of 2018. This will advance our transition to a digital media company. We believe that with these actions our business, results of operations and financial condition will be positively impacted.

Acquisition of Daily Engage Media 

In September 2017 pursuant to the terms of an Amended and Restated Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, we acquired 100% of the membership interests of Daily Engage Media. The terms of this transaction are described later in this Memorandum. Launched in 2015, Daily Engage Media is an advertising network company that matches advertisers with publishers. It offers video, display, mobile and native ads, providing focused promotion for advertisers of products and services while helping websites monetize their visitor traffic. Its advertising exchange platform is being designed to be a trading desk for publishers and advertisers where they will be able to log-in and choose from various features. Publishers will be able to select a variety of advertising units for their video, mobile, display and native advertisements and also have the ability to create their own unique advertising formats. Advertisers will be able to choose where their advertisements will be seen using our filters or by connection directly with the publisher through our platform. Daily Engage Media's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 (audited) were $1,647,596 and it reported a net loss of $33,607. 

Since inception, Daily Engage Media has grown its business through aggressive sales efforts and branding, including:


· | establishing favorable contract terms with many key advertising demand parties; 
· | supply relationships with approximately 200 digital publishers and a pipeline of 700 others;
· | proprietary software to collect and report results for publisher clients; 
· | ability and software to quickly and efficiently detect fraudulent traffic; and 
· | highly scalable sales and ad operations functions.

Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network

Subject to the availability of sufficient working capital, we expect to complete the development of the ad exchange platform that Daily Engage Media has under development and utilize that technology for the basis of launching our Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network. Our Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network will be a trading desk for publishers and advertisers where they will be able to login and choose from various features to maximize their earning potential. Publishers will be able to select a variety of ad units for their video, mobile, display and native advertisements and have the ability to create their own unique ad formats. Advertisers will be able to choose where their ads will be seen using our filters or by connection directly with the publisher through our platform.

This new platform is expected to have a significant impact on our revenues and its capabilities will include:


· | server integration with several ad exchanges, making for extremely quick ad deployments; 
· | leading targeting technology, allowing advertisers to pinpoint their marketing efforts to reach the military-public safety demographic across mobile, tablet, and desktop;
· | capable of handling any ad format, including video, display, and native ads; and 
· | ad serving and self-service features for publishers and advertisers. 


The Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network will be a custom-built platform, which will be user friendly for both the publisher and the advertiser. It will have technology that will allow ads to be served at the highest speeds in the industry and the ability to precisely geo target the area the ads will be shown. 

We believe that the acquisition of Daily Engage Media and the development of the ad exchange network has and will have the following benefits:


· | allow us to immediately begin selling advertising to the thousands of other publishers (websites) in our military-public safety demographic; 
· | disrupt the digital market for military-public safety audiences and advertisers by being the first vertically integrated publisher/ad network in our demographic; and 
· | place us into the position as the only fully integrated digital business that serves the publisher, ad network, ad exchange and e-commerce needs of the military-public safety demographic.


The key components of the Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network are expected to include:


· | the sale of all digital advertising inventory on Bright Mountain Media owned websites directly to brands and advertisers, as well as on ad exchanges which are online marketplaces where digital advertising spaces are bought and sold;
· | the sale of digital advertising inventory from similar web properties not owned by us directly to brands, advertisers and ad exchanges for which we will receive a commission; 
· | software that will facilitate the sale of ad inventory as well as software that will deliver the paid-for advertising to all websites within the Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network; 
· | the ability to leverage our combined audience size in the Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network to command higher paying advertising across our network of web properties; 
· | the eventual expansion to represent websites beyond our initial niche scope to include broader male demographic segments; and 
· | expansion of our heroes demographic to include all men aged 18 to 50.

Our Strategy

We believe that the combination of our owned websites ad inventory with an ever-growing ad inventory from websites which we represent will uniquely position our company as the largest single source for brands and advertisers to reach these desired hero audiences.

The Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network, a programmatic and directly sold advertising network, is a key element to our strategy. The Ad Network will allow us to substantially increase the size of our audience within our niche demographic that can be sold to advertisers and brands. Programmatic advertising networks are designed to help marketers and their agencies connect with consumers through digital media at moments when that connection is most likely to be influential and most likely to achieve the advertisers objectives. Programmatic buying is the automated purchase of digital advertising inventory through a combination of machine-based transactions, data and algorithms. RTB, a subset of programmatic buying, is the real-time purchase and sale of advertising inventory on an impression-by-impression basis on ad exchanges. Programmatic buying and RTB are emerging and growing trends in the buying and selling of digital advertising inventory. The recognition by advertisers that an increased use of programmatic buying and RTB systems may constitute an effective way to achieve their campaign goals and cost savings, and the recognition by digital media property owners that they may achieve greater returns from an increased use of programmatic buying and RTB systems may prove beneficial to us. Daily Engage Media has just launched an RTB platform.

The Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network is expected to market all the Bright Mountain Media owned advertising inventory together with similar websites in our demographic. We believe this strategy will create scale to attract interest from potential brands and advertisers, advertising networks and advertising exchanges. Simply put, the programmatic nature of this network will allow for:


· | first, selling the advertising inventory in real time at the highest possible price; 
· | second, the program will interact with all the publishers in the Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network reporting impressions, ad fill rates, CPMs, click through rates, and estimated revenue; and
· | third, we plan to incorporate into this software a platform where advertisers can directly make purchases on the Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network. 


To implement this strategy, subject to the availability of sufficient capital we intend to:


· | accelerate the growth of the Daily Engage Media acquisition; 
· | achieve a dominant market share of our ‘heroes’ and young male audience segments in order to be a single source for advertisers and brands to connect them all;
· | add IT, administration, sales support and advertising operation personnel; and 
· | acquire additional websites and improve existing websites. 

Terms of Daily Engage Media Acquisition

The consideration for the acquisition of Daily Engage Media was as follows:


· | $380,000 paid through the delivery of unsecured, interest free, one year promissory notes (the Closing Notes). As set forth later in this report, the total amount of these notes has been reduced by $125,313 for post-closing working capital adjustments;
· | an aggregate of 1,100,233 shares of our common stock valued at $432,987 (the “Consideration Shares”); and 
· | the forgiveness of $204,411 in working capital loans we had previously advanced Daily Engage Media. 


In addition, at closing we satisfied $123,913 owed by Daily Engage Media to various lenders.

Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement, upon Daily Engage Media achieving certain revenue and operating income tests as projected by the Daily Engage Media Members, we agreed to issue additional consideration as follows:


· | if Daily Engage Media's revenues are at least $20,228,954, and it has operating income of at least $3,518,623 (the Year-One Daily Engage Target) during the first 12 months following the closing date (the Year-One Earnout Period) as determined by us in accordance with GAAP, we agreed to pay the seller and the third party collectively an additional $500,000 in cash and issue an additional 1,008,547 shares of our common stock (the Year-One Earnout Shares); 
· | if Daily Engage Media's revenues are at least $60,385,952, and operating income of at least $11,380,396 (the Year-Two Daily Engage Target) during the first 12 months following the Year-One Earnout Period (the Year-Two Earnout Period) as determined by us in accordance with GAAP, we agreed to pay the sellers and the third party an additional $500,000 in cash and issue an additional 796,221 shares of our common stock (the Year-Two Earnout Shares). In addition, if the Year-Two Daily Engage Target is met, at the time of payment of the Year-Two Earnout Shares and the year-two earnout cash, the sellers and the third party collectively will also be entitled to receive the Year-One Earnout Shares and the year-one earnout cash to the extent not previously received; and 
· | if Daily Engage Media's revenues are at least $96,512,204, and it has operating income of at least $18,524,967 (the Year-Three Daily Engage Target) during the 12 months following the Year-Two Earnout Period (the Year-Three Earnout Period) as determined by us in accordance with GAAP, we agreed to pay the sellers and the third party an additional $500,000 in cash and issue an additional 723,523 shares of our common stock (the Year-Three Earnout Shares). In addition, if the Year-Three Daily Engage Target is met, at the time of payment of the Year-Three Earnout Shares and the year-three earnout cash, the sellers and the third party collectively will also be entitled to receive the Year-One Earnout Shares, the year-one earnout cash, the Year-Two Earnout Shares and the year-two earnout cash, to the extent not previously received.


The Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement contained customary confidentiality and non-compete provisions, and we entered into a separate letter agreement with the third party which contained invention assignment and non-compete provisions.

BrightWatches.com, BlackHelmet.com and GoPoliceBlotter.com are web-based stores where shoppers can purchase a variety of products including watches, clocks, apparel and accessories. We maintain an inventory of watches and clocks. The proprietary Black Helmet Apparel product line of clothing and accessories features designs that are hand drawn, unique and relay the fearless side of firefighting, including:


· | T-shirts | · | jackets 
· | sweatshirts | · | drinkware 
· | wallets | · | knives 
· | hats | · | jewelry, including bracelets, earrings and pendants
· | decals and patches | · | phone accessories 
· | sunglasses | · | backpacks 


We sell these products through various distribution portals, which include Amazon and eBay, and through direct sales. 

In 2017 Black Helmet Apparel performed a market test for subscription sales to its customers for mystery boxes. Based on the success of the market testing, the Company plans to begin offering this subscription to all customers in the second quarter of 2018. We will be using software that allows us to match our products with our customers interests and focus on specific demographic groups that we feel will be most successful to the program. The fee for the monthly subscription will be approximately $30. We believe that this price point will allow us to reach a large audience, while maintaining profitable margins. Based on the variety of merchandise mentioned above, we feel our mystery boxes will be an attractive product line for our audience however there are no assurances that we will develop any significant revenues from this offering. 

Intellectual Property

We currently rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our software documentation and other proprietary information. We own various service marks and trademarks, which are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office including the following: 

THE BRIGHT NETWORK Design and Service Mark;
 THEBRIGHT.COM Logo Trade Mark and Service Mark;
 BRIGHT MOUNTAIN Service Mark; and
 BLACK HELMET Trademark

In addition to www.brightmountainmedia.com and www.thebright.com, we own multiple domain names that we may or may not operate in the future.

Technology

Our top technical priority is the fast and reliable delivery of pages and ads to our users. Our systems are designed to handle traffic and network growth. We rely on multiple tiers of redundancy/failover and third-party content delivery network to achieve our goal of 24 hours, seven-days-a-week Website uptime. Regular automated backups protect the integrity of our data. Our servers are continuously monitored by numerous third-party and open-source monitoring and alerting tools.

Competition

The internet and industries that operate through it are intensely competitive. We compete with other companies that have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and distribution resources. Our competitors include FoxNews.com, Yahoo!, AOL and its subsidiary Huffington Post. Yahoo!, AOL and Huffington Post were recently acquired by Verizon Communications as it looks for growth in the digital, mobile and video marketplace.

We believe that we can effectively compete in the marketplace for the following reasons:


· | the acquisition of Daily Engage Media will accelerate the development of the Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange Network; 
· | we have limited ourselves to certain niche, but significant and identifiable, markets; 
· | we have customized our websites to the interests of our users and provide excellent content and news; and 
· | our CEO, W. Kip Speyer, has had extensive entrepreneurial and management experience, including experience with public companies.


Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources as well as greater experience in the industry than we have. There are no assurances we will ever be able to effectively compete in our marketplace. Our websites may not be competitive with other technologies and/or our websites may be displaced by newer technology. If this happens, our sales and revenues will likely decline. In addition, our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships with larger companies, to gain access to greater development or marketing resources. Competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share.

Government regulation

Aspects of the digital marketing and advertising industry and how our business operates are highly regulated. We are subject to a number of domestic and, to the extent our operations are conducted outside the U.S., foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet and through other electronic means, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In particular, we are subject to rules of the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and potentially other federal agencies and state laws related to our advertising content and methods, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM Act, which establishes certain requirements for commercial electronic mail messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial electronic mail messages that follow a recipients opt-out request or are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content, and federal and state regulations covering the treatment of member data that we collect from endorsers.

U.S. and foreign regulations and laws potentially affecting our business are evolving frequently. We currently have not developed our internal compliance program, nor do we have policies in place to monitor compliance. Instead, we rely on the policies of our publishing partners. If we are unable to identify all regulations to which our business is subject and implement effective means of compliance, we could be subject to enforcement actions, lawsuits and penalties, including but not limited to fines and other monetary liability or injunction that could prevent us from operating our business or certain aspects of our business. In addition, compliance with the regulations to which we are subject now or in the future may require changes to our products or services, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon material aspects of our services. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The FTC adopted Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising on October 5, 2009. These guides recommend that advertisers and publishers clearly disclose in third-party endorsements made online, such as in social media, if compensation was received in exchange for said endorsements. Because some of our marketing campaigns entail the engagement of consumers to refer other consumers in their social networks to view ads or take action, and both we and the consumer may earn cash and other incentives, any failure on our part to comply with these guides may be damaging to our business. We currently do not take any steps to monitor compliance with these guides. In the event of a violation, the FTC could potentially identify a violation of the guides, which could subject us to a financial penalty or loss of endorsers or advertisers.

In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to Californias Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.

We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data. Any failure by us to comply with these privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws, and their application to the internet is unclear and in a state of flux. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our members privacy and data could result in a loss of member confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of members and customers, which could adversely affect our business.

Employees

At March 20, 2018 we had 19 full-time and five part-time employees. We also utilize the services of 22 independent contractors who provide content, operational and related website services.
