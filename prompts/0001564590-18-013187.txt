ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 Ennis, Inc. (“we” or the “Company”) was organized under the laws of Texas in 1909. The Company and its subsidiaries print and manufacture a broad line of business forms and other business products.  We distribute business products and forms throughout the United States primarily through independent dealers.  This distributor channel encompasses independent print distributors, commercial printers, direct mail, fulfillment companies, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies, among others.  We also sell products to many of our competitors to satisfy their customers’ needs.
 On April 30, 2018, we acquired the assets of a tag and label operation located in New York for $4.75 million in cash plus the assumption of trade payables.  On July 7, 2017, we acquired the assets of a tag operation located in Ohio, for $1.4 million in cash plus the assumption of certain accrued liabilities.  Management considers both of these acquisitions immaterial.
 On January 27, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Independent Printing Company, Inc. and its related entities (collectively “Independent”) for $17.7 million in cash consideration, in a stock purchase transaction.  Independent’s main facility located in DePere, Wisconsin. The business produces presentation folders, checks, wide format and commercial print. Independent operates under its brand name and generated approximately $37.0 million in sales during the 2016 calendar year.  Independent sells mainly through distributors and resellers. We now have four folder facilities located in Michigan, Kansas, California and Wisconsin, as well as wide format capabilities in Colorado and Wisconsin.
 On May 25, 2016 the Company sold its apparel business, consisting of Alstyle Apparel, LLC and its subsidiaries (the “Apparel Segment”) to Gildan Activewear Inc. (“Gildan”) for an all-cash purchase price of $110.0 million, subject to a working capital adjustment, customary indemnification arrangements, and the other terms of the Unit Purchase Agreement dated May 4, 2016.  In connection with the sale of the Apparel Segment to Gildan, the Company was required to place $2.0 million of the purchase price in escrow as a source of funds to pay any liabilities that arose post-closing from an employment contract with a former officer of the Company.  The Company believed in good faith, based on consultation with its advisors, that no liability existed with respect to the employment contract, and as such, recorded a receivable for the full amount of the funds held in escrow.  In January 2017, the purchaser, without notice to the Company, voluntarily paid $2.0 million to the former officer of the Company and requested that all of the escrowed funds be released to it as reimbursement.  The Company denied the request, due in part because of the purchaser’s failure to provide the Company prior notice and a right to defend as the Company believes was contractually required.  In February 2018 an arbitrator ruled in favor of Gildan but did not authorize the release of the escrow funds, as his opinion was appealable.  Although the Company has filed a complaint to vacate the arbitrator’s opinion, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 the Company wrote off the full amount of the receivable.
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we moved our folder operations from Omaha, Nebraska to Columbus, Kansas, due to the landlord’s desire to sell the facility.  The move and inefficiencies associated with starting-up and training new employees had a negative impact on revenues and operational margins over the first half of fiscal year 2017.  However, during the second half of fiscal year 2017 we saw a turnaround and the operations were marginally profitable.  This momentum largely carried over into the 2018 fiscal year.  In addition, our medical claims during fiscal year 2017 exceeded historical levels, which resulted in us incurring an additional $4.3 million in increased medical charges that had a negative impact on our earnings.  To mitigate further medical charges, we implemented a new cost reimbursement program, as well as other changes to our health plan, as of the start of the calendar year 2017.  At the completion of the first year of this program, we are encouraged with the results.

Business Overview
 Our management believes we are the largest provider of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders to independent distributors in the United States.
 We are in the business of manufacturing, designing and selling business forms and other printed business products primarily to distributors located in the United States. We operate 56 manufacturing plants throughout the United States in 20 strategically located states. Approximately 95% of the business products manufactured are custom and semi-custom products, constructed in a wide variety of sizes, colors, number of parts and quantities on an individual job basis, depending upon the customers’ specifications.
 The products sold include snap sets, continuous forms, laser cut sheets, tags, labels, envelopes, integrated products, jumbo rolls and pressure sensitive products in short, medium and long runs under the following labels: Ennis®, Royal Business Forms®, Block Graphics®, Specialized Printed Forms®, 360º Custom LabelsSM, ColorWorx®, Enfusion®, Uncompromised Check Solutions®, VersaSeal®, Ad ConceptsSM, FormSource LimitedSM, Star Award Ribbon Company®, Witt Printing®, B&D Litho®, Genforms®, PrintGraphicsSM, Calibrated Forms®, PrintXcelSM, Printegra®, Curtis Business FormsSM, Falcon Business FormsSM, Forms ManufacturersSM, Mutual GraphicsSM, TRI-C Business FormsSM, Major Business SystemsSM, Independent PrintingSM, Hoosier Data Forms®, and Hayes Graphics®.  We also sell the Adams McClure® brand (which provides Point of Purchase advertising for large franchise and fast food chains as well as kitting and fulfillment); the Admore®, Folder Express®, and Independent Folders® brands (which provide presentation folders and document folders); Ennis Tag & LabelSM (which provides custom printed, high performance labels and custom and stock tags); Atlas Tag & Label®, Kay Toledo Tag® and Special Service Partners® (SSP) (which provides custom and stock tags and labels); Trade Envelopes®, Block Graphics®, Wisco® and National Imprint Corporation® (which provide custom and imprinted envelopes) and Northstar® and General Financial Supply® (which provide financial and security documents).
 We sell predominantly through private printers and independent distributors, as well as to many of our competitors. Northstar Computer Forms, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, also sells direct to a small number of customers, generally large banking organizations (where a distributor is not acceptable or available to the end-user).  Adams McClure, LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary, also sells direct to a small number of customers, where sales are generally through advertising agencies.
 The printing industry generally sells its products either predominantly to end users, a market dominated by a few large manufacturers, such as R.R. Donnelley and Sons, Staples, Inc., Standard Register Co. (a subsidiary of Taylor Corporation), and Cenveo, Inc., or, like the Company, through a variety of independent distributors and distributor groups. While it is not possible, because of the lack of adequate public statistical information, to determine the Company’s share of the total business products market, management believes the Company is the largest producer of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders in the United States distributing primarily through independent dealers. 
 There are a number of competitors that operate in this segment, ranging in size from single employee-owned operations to multi-plant organizations. We believe our strategic locations and buying power permit us to compete on a favorable basis within the distributor market on competitive factors, such as service, quality, and price.
 Distribution of business forms and other business products throughout the United States is primarily done through independent dealers, including business forms distributors, resellers, direct mail, commercial printers, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies.
 Raw materials principally consist of a wide variety of weights, widths, colors, sizes, and qualities of paper for business products purchased from generally one major supplier at favorable prices based on the volume of business.
 Business products usage in the printing industry is generally not seasonal. General economic conditions and contraction of the traditional business forms industry are the predominant factors in quarterly volume fluctuations.

Environment
 We are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, air emissions and solid waste disposal.

We do not believe that our compliance with federal, state, or local statutes or regulations relating to the protection of the environment has any material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that future changes in federal, state, or local regulations, interpretations of existing regulations or the discovery of currently unknown problems or conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures. Similarly, the extent of our liability, if any, for past failures to comply with laws, regulations, and permits applicable to our operations cannot be determined.
Employees
 At February 28, 2018, we had 2,183 employees.  210 employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic negotiations.
