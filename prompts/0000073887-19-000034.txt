Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are the leading global industrial aviation services provider based on the number of aircraft operated. We have a long history in industrial aviation services through Bristow Helicopters Ltd. (“Bristow Helicopters”) and Offshore Logistics, Inc., which were founded in 1955 and 1969, respectively. We have major transportation operations in the North Sea, Nigeria and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and in most of the other major offshore energy producing regions of the world, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Russia and Trinidad. We provide private sector SAR services in Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia, Trinidad and the United States. We provide public sector SAR services in the U.K. on behalf of the Maritime & Coastguard Agency. We also provide regional fixed wing scheduled and charter services in the U.K., Nigeria and Australia through our consolidated affiliates, Eastern Airways International Limited (“Eastern Airways”) and Capiteq Limited, operating under the name of Airnorth, respectively. These operations support our primary industrial aviation services operations in those markets, creating a more integrated logistics solution for our clients. 
During fiscal year 2018, we generated approximately 68% of our consolidated operating revenue from external clients from oil and gas operations, approximately 17% from U.K. SAR operations and approximately 15% from fixed wing services, including charter and scheduled airline services that support our global helicopter operations.
We conduct our business in one segment: industrial aviation services. The industrial aviation services segment operations are conducted primarily through two hubs that include four regions:

• | Europe Caspian,


• | Africa,


• | Americas, and


• | Asia Pacific.

We primarily provide industrial aviation services to a broad base of major integrated, national and independent offshore energy companies. Our clients charter our helicopters primarily to transport personnel between onshore bases and offshore production platforms, drilling rigs and other installations. To a lesser extent, our clients also charter our helicopters to transport time-sensitive equipment to these offshore locations. These clients’ operating expenditures in the production sector are the principal source of our revenue, while their exploration and development capital expenditures provide a lesser portion of our revenue. The clients for SAR services include both the oil and gas industry, where our revenue is primarily dependent on our clients’ operating expenditures, and governmental agencies, where our revenue is dependent on a country’s desire to privatize SAR and enter into long-term contracts.
Helicopters are generally classified as small (four to eight passenger capacity), medium (12 to 16 passenger capacity) and large (16 to 25 passenger capacity), each of which serves a different transportation need of the offshore energy industry. Medium and large helicopters, which can fly in a wider variety of operating conditions, over longer distances, at higher speeds and carry larger payloads than small helicopters, are most commonly used for crew changes on large offshore production facilities and drilling rigs. With these enhanced capabilities, medium and large helicopters have historically been preferred in international markets, where the offshore facilities tend to be larger, the drilling locations tend to be more remote, located in harsh environments and the onshore infrastructure tends to be more limited. Additionally, local governmental regulations in certain international markets require us to operate twin-engine medium and large aircraft in those markets. Global demand for medium and large helicopters is driven by drilling, development and production activity levels in deepwater locations throughout the world, as the medium and large aircraft are able to travel to these deepwater locations. Small helicopters are generally used for shorter routes and to reach production facilities that cannot accommodate medium and large helicopters. Historically, our small helicopters have operated primarily over the shallow waters offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria. We are able to deploy our aircraft to the regions with the greatest demand, subject to the satisfaction of local governmental regulations. SAR operations utilize medium and large aircraft that are specially configured to conduct these types of operations in environments around the world. The commercial aircraft in our consolidated fleet are our primary source of revenue. To normalize the consolidated operating revenue of our commercial helicopter fleet for the different revenue productivity and cost, we developed a common weighted factor that combines large, medium and small commercial helicopters into a combined standardized number of revenue producing commercial aircraft assets. We call this measure Large AirCraft Equivalent (“LACE”). Our commercial large, medium and small helicopters, including owned and leased helicopters, are weighted as 100%, 50%, and 25%, respectively, to arrive at a single LACE number, 
3

which excludes fixed wing aircraft, unconsolidated affiliate aircraft, aircraft held for sale and aircraft construction in process. We divide our operating revenue from commercial contracts relating to LACE aircraft, which excludes operating revenue from affiliates and reimbursable revenue, by LACE to develop a LACE rate, which is a standardized rate. 
The SAR market is continuing to evolve and we believe further outsourcing of public SAR services to the private sector will continue in the future, although the timing of these opportunities is uncertain. The clients for our SAR services include both the oil and gas industry and governmental agencies. We are pursuing other public and oil and gas SAR opportunities for multiple aircraft in various jurisdictions around the globe and other non-SAR government aircraft logistics opportunities. 
Our business has traditionally been significantly dependent upon the level of offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production activity. We have begun diversification with recent investments into other new business growth areas within the industrial aviation services to lessen the cyclical effects of a downturn in any one industry or economy. There are also additional markets for aviation services beyond the offshore energy industry and SAR, including air medical, agricultural support, corporate transportation, firefighting, military, police, tourism and traffic monitoring. The existence of these alternative markets enables us to better manage our helicopter fleet by providing potential purchasers for older aircraft and for our excess aircraft during times of reduced demand in the offshore energy industry. 
Additionally, we have fixed wing operations in the U.K., Nigeria and Australia that create a more integrated logistics solution for our global clients and further diversify our business.
Most countries in which we operate limit foreign ownership of aviation companies. To comply with these regulations and at the same time expand internationally, we have formed or acquired interests in a number of foreign aviation operators. These investments typically combine a local ownership interest with our experience in providing industrial aviation services to the offshore energy industry. These arrangements have allowed us to expand operations while diversifying the risks and reducing the capital outlays associated with independent expansion. We lease some of our aircraft to a number of unconsolidated affiliates, which in turn provide industrial aviation services to clients locally.
We regularly engage in discussions with potential sellers and strategic partners regarding the possible purchase of assets, pursuit of joint ventures or other expansion opportunities that increase our position in existing markets or facilitate expansion into new markets. We may also divest portions of our business or assets to narrow our product lines and reduce our operational footprint to reduce leverage and improve return on capital. These potential expansion opportunities and divestitures may consist of both smaller transactions as well as larger transactions that could have a material impact on our financial position, cash flow and results of operations. We cannot predict the likelihood of completing, or the timing of, any such transactions.
The oil and gas business environment experienced a significant downturn beginning during fiscal year 2015. Brent crude oil prices declined from approximately $106 per barrel at July 1, 2014 to a low of approximately $26 per barrel in February 2016, with an increase to approximately $65 per barrel as of March 31, 2018. The decrease in oil prices was driven by increased global supply and forecasts of reduced demand for crude oil resulting from weaker global economic growth in many regions of the world. The oil price decline negatively impacted the cash flow of our clients and resulted in their implementation of measures to reduce operational and capital costs, negatively impacting activity beginning in fiscal year 2015. These cost reductions have continued into fiscal year 2018 and have impacted both the offshore production and the offshore exploration activity of our clients, with offshore production activity being impacted to a lesser extent. Although the largest share of our revenue relates to oil and gas production and our largest contract, the U.K. SAR contract (as defined herein), is not directly impacted by declining oil prices, the significant drop in the price of crude oil resulted in the rescaling, delay or cancellation of planned offshore projects which has negatively impacted our operations and could continue to negatively impact our operations in future periods. 
The oil price environment is showing signs of stabilizing with crude oil prices at levels not seen since the end of calendar year 2014. We are seeing an increase in offshore market activity off of a very low base level with an increased number of working floaters and jackups in our core markets, including the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and North Sea. There have also been significant increases in front end engineering and design awards that, along with the stabilization of tie-back work and floating production storage and offloading unit utilization, has historically been a leading indicator of increased offshore activity. The helicopter transportation industry is benefiting from relatively low day rates for rigs, which in turn reduces our oil and gas clients’ costs and generates increased demand for offshore transportation like helicopters. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, our success in reducing costs and our faster hub response has made us more competitive, and we are gaining market share in this new environment for short-cycle requirements created by the changing market; however, we are uncertain as to whether this increased activity will lead to a recovery in offshore spending, and an extended period of reduced offshore spending may have a material impact on our financial position, cash flow and results of operations.

Region Operations
Europe Caspian
Based on the number of aircraft operating, we are one of the largest providers of industrial aviation services in the North Sea, where there are harsh weather conditions and geographically concentrated offshore facilities. As of March 31, 2018, we operated our oil and gas operations in our Europe Caspian region from four bases in the U.K. and four bases in Norway. The offshore facilities in the Northern North Sea and Norwegian North Sea are large and require frequent crew change flight services. In the Southern North Sea, the facilities are generally smaller with some unmanned platforms requiring shuttle operations to up-man in the morning and down-man in the evening. We deploy the majority of the large aircraft in our consolidated fleet in the North Sea where our clients are primarily major integrated and independent offshore energy companies. Our North Sea operations are subject to seasonality as drilling activity is lower during the winter months due to harsh weather and shorter days.
We provide commercial SAR services for a number of oil and gas companies operating in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. 
We have a contract with the U.K. Department for Transport (the “DfT”) to provide public sector SAR services for all of the U.K. (the “U.K. SAR contract”). The U.K. SAR contract has a phased-in transition period that began in April 2015 and continued to July 2017 with a contract length of approximately ten years. We are currently operational at all ten bases as follows: Humberside and Inverness (April 2015), Caernarfon (July 2015), Lydd (August 2015), St. Athan (October 2015), Prestwick and Newquay (January 2016), Lee-on-Solent (March 2017), and two previously awarded Gap SAR bases of Sumburgh (June 2013) and Stornoway (July 2013). One Gap SAR base transitioned to the U.K. SAR contract on March 31, 2017 and the remaining Gap SAR base transitioned to the U.K. SAR contract on July 1, 2017. Although the U.K. SAR contract calls for 11 U.K. SAR configured S-92s and 11 U.K. SAR configured AW189s, as of March 31, 2018, we are servicing this contract utilizing the following U.K. SAR configured aircraft: 14 S-92s (11 of which are leased), nine AW189s (two of which are leased) and four AW139s (all four are leased). 
Bristow Helicopters owns a 100% interest in Eastern Airways, a regional fixed wing operator based in the U.K. Eastern Airways has approximately 650 employees and its operations focus on providing scheduled and charter services targeting U.K. oil and gas transport. Eastern Airways operates 34 fixed wing aircraft and provides technical support for two fixed wing aircraft operating in our Africa region. We believe our investment in Eastern Airways strengthens our ability to provide a complete suite of point to point transportation services for existing European based passengers, expand industrial aviation services in certain areas like the Shetland Islands and create a more integrated logistics solution for global clients.
Additionally, our Europe Caspian region includes operations in Turkmenistan. We operate one medium aircraft through our 51% interest in Turkmenistan Helicopters Limited, a Turkmenistan corporation that provides industrial aviation services to an international offshore energy company from a single location.
7

Africa
As of March 31, 2018, most of the aircraft in our Africa region operated in Nigeria, where we are the largest provider of industrial aviation services to the offshore energy industry. We have historically deployed a combination of small, medium and large aircraft in Nigeria and service a client base comprised mostly of major integrated offshore energy companies. We have four operational bases located as follows: one in Lagos, one in Eket and two in Port Harcourt. The marketplace for our services had historically been concentrated predominantly in the oil rich swamp and shallow waters of the Niger Delta area. More recently we have been undertaking work further offshore in support of deepwater exploration. Operations in Nigeria are subject to seasonality as the Harmattan, a dry and dusty trade wind, blows between the end of December and the middle of February. At times when the heavy amount of dust in the air severely limits visibility, our aircraft are unable to operate. 
In October 2015, we began providing fixed wing services to provide end-to-end transportation services for principally oil and gas industry customers and currently operate two fixed wing aircraft in support of this service.
We own a 25% interest in PAS, an Egyptian corporation which provides helicopter and fixed wing transportation to the offshore energy industry. Additionally, spare fixed wing capacity is chartered to tourism operators. PAS operates 41 helicopters and seven fixed wing aircraft from multiple locations. The remaining 75% interest in PAS is owned by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation.
Americas
As of March 31, 2018, we operated from three operating facilities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We are one of the largest suppliers of industrial aviation services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Our clients in this region are mostly independent and major integrated offshore energy companies. The U.S. Gulf of Mexico is a major offshore energy producing region. The shallow water platforms are typically unmanned and are serviced by small aircraft. The deepwater platforms are serviced by medium and large aircraft. Among our strengths in this region, in addition to our operating facilities, are our advanced flight-following systems and our widespread and strategically located offshore fuel stations. Operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are subject to seasonality as the months of December through March typically have more days of harsh weather conditions than the other months of the year. Additionally, during the months of June through November, tropical storms and hurricanes may reduce activity as we are unable to operate in the area of the storm.
We also operate a SAR base at the South Lafourche Airport in Galliano, Louisiana. From this base, we have two medium and one large aircraft that provide SAR and/or medical evacuation services to oil and gas operators.
Additionally, we operate seven medium and one large aircraft in Trinidad from a base located at Trinidad’s Piarco International Airport and three medium aircraft in Guyana from a base located at Ogle International Airport. Our clients in Trinidad and Guyana are primarily engaged in offshore energy activities. We also provide rescue and recovery services for our clients in Trinidad and Guyana.
We own a 40% economic interest in Cougar Helicopters Inc. (“Cougar”), the largest offshore energy and SAR helicopter service provider in Atlantic Canada. Cougar has approximately 220 employees and its operations are primarily focused on serving the offshore oil and gas industry off Canada’s Atlantic coast. We leased eight large helicopters and four shore-based facilities to Cougar as of March 31, 2018, including state-of-the-art helicopter passenger, maintenance and SAR facilities located in Newfoundland and Labrador.
We also own a 41.9% economic interest in Líder, a provider of helicopter and corporate aviation services in Brazil. Líder has approximately 1,250 employees and operates through five primary operating units: helicopter service, maintenance, chartering, ground handling and aircraft sales, and provides commercial SAR and medical evacuation services to the oil and gas industry. Líder’s fleet includes 41 rotor wing and 20 fixed wing aircraft (including owned and managed aircraft). Líder also has a vast network of bases located strategically in Brazil. including locations in Macae, Rio de Janiero and Vitória, and is headquartered in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
Asia Pacific
As of March 31, 2018, we operated in Australia from three bases located in Western Australia, one base in Victoria and one base in Northern Territory. Our operating bases are located in the vicinity of the major offshore energy exploration and production fields in the North West Shelf, the Browse and Carnarvon basins of Western Australia and the Bass Straits in Victoria. Our clients in Australia are primarily major integrated offshore energy companies. Additionally, we provide SAR and medical evacuation services to the oil and gas industry in Australia and engineering support to the Republic of Singapore Air Force’s fleet of helicopters at their base in Oakey, Queensland. Operations in the Asia Pacific region during the months of November through April may be impacted by cyclones that may reduce activity as we are unable to operate in the area of the storm.

Bristow Helicopters Australia owns a 100% interest in Airnorth, a regional fixed wing operator based in Darwin, North Territory, Australia. Airnorth has approximately 250 employees and its operations focus on providing both charter and scheduled services targeting the energy and mining industries in Northern and Western Australia as well as international services to Dili, Timor-Leste. Airnorth operates 14 fixed wing aircraft. We believe this investment strengthens our ability to provide point to point transportation services for existing Australian based passengers, expand industrial aviation services in certain areas in Southeast Asian markets and create a more integrated logistics solution for global clients.
Additionally, we operate seven large aircraft in Russia from three locations on Sakhalin Island, where we provide industrial aviation services to international and domestic offshore energy companies and operate a local SAR service.
Clients and Contracts
Our principal clients are major integrated, national and independent offshore energy companies and the U.K. Department for Transport. The following table presents our top ten clients in fiscal year 2018 and their percentage contribution to our consolidated gross revenue during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 and includes any clients accounting for 10% or more of our consolidated gross revenue during such fiscal years.

(2) | As discussed above, we own a 40% economic interest in Cougar.

Our helicopter contracts are generally based on a two-tier rate structure consisting of a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown. We also provide services to clients on an “ad hoc” basis, which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter contract duration. Our charges for ad hoc services are generally based on an hourly rate, or a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown. Generally, our ad hoc services have a higher margin than our other helicopter contracts due to supply and demand dynamics.
Generally, our oil and gas helicopter contracts are cancelable by the client with a notice period ranging from 30 to 180 days and in some cases up to one year. In the Americas region, we generally enter into short-term contracts for twelve months or less. Outside of the Americas, contracts are typically between two and five years in term. These long term contracts may also include escalation provisions allowing annual rate increases, which may be based on a fixed dollar or percentage increase, an increase in an agreed index or our actual substantiated increased costs, which we negotiate to pass along to clients. Cost reimbursements from clients are recorded as reimbursable revenue with the related reimbursed cost recorded as reimbursable expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
Generally, SAR services contracts include a monthly standing charge, which average approximately 85% of the total contract revenue, and a monthly variable charge that covers flying, fuel and ancillary items, which average approximately 15% of the total contract revenue. See further details on the U.K. SAR contract in “— Region Operations — Europe Caspian.”
Our fixed wing services are generally provided through scheduled charter service or regular public transport service. For scheduled charter service, our contracts typically include variable rates based on the number of passengers, flights or flight hours. These agreements may also include a monthly standing charge; however, this is much less common as compared to helicopter contracts. We also provide charter services to clients on an “ad hoc” basis, which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter contract duration. Regular public transport service is provided through established daily or weekly flight schedules and is based upon individual ticket sales to customers.

Competition
The helicopter and fixed wing businesses are highly competitive throughout the world. We compete directly against multiple providers in almost all of our operating regions. We have several significant competitors in the North Sea, Nigeria, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Australia, and a number of smaller local competitors in other markets. Globally, we have seen a recent increase in competitive pressure and new regulation that could impact our ability to win future work. Competition has intensified and new competitors could enter our industry if they are willing to make a significant capital investment, have access to working capital, onshore and offshore bases, personnel and operating experience. These requirements can be achieved with the appropriate level of client support and commitment. In addition, while not the predominant practice, certain of our clients and potential clients in the offshore energy industry perform their own industrial aviation services.
In most situations, clients charter aircraft on the basis of competitive bidding. On limited occasions, our clients renew or extend existing contracts without employing a competitive bid process. Contracts are generally awarded based on a number of factors, including price, quality of service, operational experience, record of safety, quality and type of equipment, client relationship and professional reputation. Incumbent operators typically have a competitive advantage in the bidding process based on their relationship with the client, knowledge of the site characteristics and existing facilities to support the operations. Because certain of our clients in the offshore energy industry have the capability to perform their own industrial aviation services, our ability to increase charter rates may be limited under certain circumstances.

We will disclose any amendment to the Code or waiver with respect to our senior officers on our website or, alternatively, through the filing of a Form 8-K.
Safety, Industry Hazards and Insurance
Hazards such as severe weather and mechanical failures are inherent in the transportation industry and may result in the loss of equipment and revenue. It is possible that personal injuries and fatalities may occur. We believe our air accident rate per 100,000 flight hours, which has historically been lower than the reported global offshore energy production helicopter average data, indicates that we have consistently performed better than the industry average with respect to safety. In fiscal year 2016, one Sikorsky S-76C+ and one Sikorsky S-76C++ aircraft operated by us were involved in accidents. In one of these accidents, two of our crew members and four passengers were fatally injured. The second accident resulted in no significant injuries or fatalities. During fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we had no accidents that resulted in fatalities.
Our well-established global safety program called “Target Zero” focuses on improved safety performance. Our safety vision is to have zero accidents, zero harm to people, and zero harm to the environment. The key components to achieving this are to improve safety culture and individual behaviors, increase the level of safety reporting by the frontline employees, increase accountability for addressing identified hazards by the operational managers and provide for independent oversight of the operational safety programs. 
We maintain hull and liability insurance which generally insures us against damage to our aircraft and the related liabilities which may be incurred as a result. We also carry insurance for war risk, expropriation and confiscation of the aircraft we use in certain of our international operations. Further, we carry various other liability and property insurance, including workers’ compensation, general liability, employers’ liability, auto liability, and property and casualty coverage. We believe that our insurance program is adequate to cover any claims ultimately incurred related to property damage and liability events.

Governmental Regulation
United States
As a commercial operator of aircraft, our U.S. operations are subject to regulations under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the “Federal Aviation Act”), and other laws. We carry persons and property in our helicopters under an Air Taxi Certificate granted by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”). The FAA regulates our U.S. flight operations and, in this respect, exercises jurisdiction over personnel, aircraft, ground facilities and certain technical aspects of our operations. The National Transportation Safety Board is authorized to investigate aircraft accidents and to recommend improved safety standards. Our U.S. operations are also subject to the Federal Communications Act of 1934 because we use radio facilities in our operations.
Under the Federal Aviation Act, it is unlawful to operate certain aircraft for hire within the U.S. unless such aircraft are registered with the FAA and the FAA has issued an operating certificate to the operator. As a general rule, aircraft may be registered under the Federal Aviation Act only if the aircraft are owned or controlled by one or more citizens of the U.S. and an operating certificate may be granted only to a citizen of the U.S. For purposes of these requirements, a corporation is deemed to be a citizen of the U.S. only if at least 75% of its voting interests are owned or controlled by U.S. citizens, the president of the company is a U.S. citizen, two-thirds or more of the directors are U.S. citizens and the company is under the actual control of U.S. citizens. If persons other than U.S. citizens should come to own or control more than 25% of our voting interest or if any of the other requirements are not met, we have been advised that our aircraft may be subject to deregistration under the Federal Aviation Act, and we may lose our ability to operate within the U.S. Deregistration of our aircraft for any reason, including foreign ownership in excess of permitted levels, would have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct certain operations within our Americas region operations. Therefore, our organizational documents currently provide for the automatic suspension of voting rights of shares of our outstanding voting capital stock owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens, and our right to redeem those shares, to the extent necessary to comply with these requirements. As of March 31, 2018, approximately 6,214,000 shares of our common stock were held of record by persons with foreign addresses. These shares represented approximately 17% of our total outstanding common stock as of March 31, 2018. Our foreign ownership may fluctuate on each trading day because our common stock is publicly traded.
We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), which generally prohibits us and our intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business.
We are subject to regulations imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and other U.S. laws and regulations that prohibit dealings with sanctioned countries and certain other third parties.
We are also subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) that control the export and import of defense-related articles, services and technical data. ITAR dictates that information and material pertaining to defense and military related technologies may only be shared with U.S. persons or organizations unless authorization from the U.S. State Department is received or a special exemption is used. We are also subject to the Export Administration Regulations (the “EAR”) that control the export of commercial and “dual use” goods. Persons or organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction may incur heavy fines if they violate ITAR or the EAR.
United Kingdom
Our operations in the U.K. are subject to the Civil Aviation Act 1982 and other similar English and E.U. statutes and regulations. We carry persons and property in our aircraft pursuant to an operating license issued by the Civil Aviation Authority (the “CAA”). The holder of an operating license must meet the ownership and control requirements of Council Regulation 2407/92. To operate under this license, the company through which we conduct operations in the U.K., Bristow Helicopters, must be owned directly or through majority ownership by E.U. nationals, and must at all times be effectively controlled by them. To comply with these restrictions, we own only 49% of the ordinary shares of Bristow Aviation, the entity that owns Bristow Helicopters. In addition, we have a put/call agreement with the other two stockholders of Bristow Aviation which grants us the right to buy all of their Bristow Aviation ordinary shares (and grants them the right to require us to buy all of their shares). Under English law, to maintain Bristow Helicopters’ operating license, we would be required to find a qualified E.U. owner to acquire any of the Bristow Aviation shares that we have the right or obligation to acquire under the put/call agreement. In addition to our equity investment in Bristow Aviation, we own deferred stock, essentially a subordinated class of stock with no voting rights, and hold subordinated debt issued by Bristow Aviation.

The CAA regulates our U.K. flight operations and exercises jurisdiction over personnel, aircraft, ground facilities and certain technical aspects of those operations. The CAA often imposes improved safety standards. Under the Licensing of Air Carriers Regulations 1992, it is unlawful to operate certain aircraft for hire within the U.K. unless such aircraft are approved by the CAA. Changes in U.K. or E.U. statutes or regulations, administrative requirements or their interpretation may have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or on our ability to continue operations in the U.K.
Also, we are subject to the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the “U.K. Bribery Act”), which creates criminal offenses for bribery and failing to prevent bribery. We are also subject to new U.K. corporate criminal offenses for failure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion pursuant to the Criminal Finances Act 2017, which imposes criminal liability on a company where it has failed to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion by a person associated with the company.
Additionally, we are obligated to comply with U.K. and E.U. Export Controls and Economic Sanctions. U.K. and E.U. regulations may prevent the export of certain controlled items to certain controlled persons or destinations. In some circumstances, export authorizations may be available in respect of such exports. A variety of penalties, both criminal and civil, may be imposed for breaches of these regulations.
Nigeria
Our operations in Nigeria are subject to the Nigerian Content Development Act 2010, which requires that oil and gas contracts be awarded to a company that is seen or perceived to have more “local content” than a “Foreign” competitor. Additionally, the Nigerian Content Development Act allows the monitoring board to penalize companies that do not meet these local content requirements up to 5% of the value of the contract. 
Other
Our operations in other markets are subject to local governmental regulations that may limit foreign ownership of aviation companies. Because of these local regulations, we conduct some of our operations through entities in which citizens of such countries own a majority interest and we hold a noncontrolling interest, or under contracts which provide that we operate assets for the local companies and conduct their flight operations. Such contracts are used for our operations in Russia and Turkmenistan. Changes in local laws, regulations or administrative requirements or their interpretation may have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or on our ability to continue operations in these areas.
Environmental
Our operations are subject to laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. If we fail to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, administrative, civil and criminal penalties may be imposed, and we may become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders. We may also be subject to civil claims arising out of a pollution event. These laws and regulations may expose us to strict, joint and several liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for our own acts even though these actions were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Increased public awareness and concern over the environment may result in future changes in the regulation of the offshore energy industry, which in turn could adversely affect us. The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and there can be no assurance as to the effect of such regulation on our operations or on the operations of our clients. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the cost of such compliance. We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. We cannot be certain that future events, such as changes in existing laws, the promulgation of new laws, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Below is a discussion of the material U.S. environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all of these environmental laws and regulations.

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and related state laws and regulations, strict, joint and several liability can be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a contaminated site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances, even from inactive operations or closed facilities that have been released into the environment. In addition, neighboring landowners or other third parties may file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response cost. We currently own, lease, or operate properties and facilities that, in some cases, have been used for industrial activities for many years. Hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment and disposal or release of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA and analogous state statutes. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for our acts that were in compliance with applicable laws at the time the acts were performed. We have been named as a potentially responsible party in connection with certain sites. See further discussion under Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
In addition, since our operations generate wastes, including some hazardous wastes, we may be subject to the provisions of the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and analogous state laws that limit the approved methods of disposal for some types of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and require owners and operators of facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste and to clean up releases of hazardous waste constituents into the environment associated with their operations. Some wastes handled by us that currently are exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA or other applicable statutes. If this were to occur, we would become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the U.S. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited unless the discharge is permitted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or applicable state agencies. Some of our properties and operations require permits for discharges of wastewater and/or stormwater, and we have a system in place for securing and maintaining these permits. In addition, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 imposes a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages, including natural resource damages, resulting from such spills in the waters of the U.S. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the cost of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges.
Some of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The Federal Clean Air Act and analogous state laws require permits for facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative, civil and even criminal penalties.
Our facilities and operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to worker health and workplace safety, including the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA. We believe that appropriate precautions are taken to protect our employees and others from harmful exposure to potentially hazardous materials handled and managed at our facilities, and that we operate in substantial compliance with all OSHA or similar regulations.
In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs.
Our operations outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign governmental controls relating to protection of the environment. We believe that, to date, our operations outside of the U.S. have been in substantial compliance with existing requirements of these foreign governmental bodies and that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our operations. There is no assurance, however, that future expenditures to maintain compliance will not become material.
