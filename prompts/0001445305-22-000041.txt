Item 1. Business
Overview
Workiva’s mission is to power transparent reporting for a better world. We believe that consumers, employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders today expect more from business – more action, transparency, and disclosure of financial and non-financial information. We build solutions to meet that demand and streamline processes, connect data and teams, and ensure consistency – all within a controlled, secure, audit-ready, cloud platform.
Workiva delivers the world’s leading cloud platform for regulatory, financial and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) reporting. Workiva provides more than 4,300 organizations with software-as-a-service solutions to help solve some of the most complex reporting and disclosure challenges. People all over the world use our connected, cloud platform to seamlessly enable collaboration and deep integration into existing work streams to simplify their most complex reporting challenges.
While our customers use our platform for more than 100 different use cases, we organize our sales and marketing resources into four solution groups focusing primarily on the office of the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”): regulatory reporting, non-regulatory reporting, financial services and integrated risk. Our platform empowers our customers by connecting and transforming data from enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), governance risk and compliance (“GRC”), human capital management (“HCM”) and customer relationship management (“CRM”) systems, as well as other third-party cloud and on-premise applications. Customers use our platform to create, review and publish data-linked documents and reports with greater control, consistency, accuracy and productivity. Our platform is flexible and scalable, so customers can easily adapt it to define, automate and change their business processes in real time.
We have experienced strong revenue growth since we released our first solution in March 2010. Our revenue increased from $297.9 million in 2019 to $443.3 million in 2021, representing a 22% compound annual growth rate. We incurred net losses of $47.5 million in 2019, $48.4 million in 2020 and $37.7 million in 2021. Approximately 86% of our revenue in 2021 was derived from subscription and support fees, with the remainder from professional services. 
Macro Trends
We designed our cloud-based platform to simplify complex work, supporting both remote and hybrid work environments. Six macro trends have been driving demand for Workiva's platform: the shift to the cloud; digital transformation; remote and hybrid work; influx of disparate data sources; increased regulatory environment; and increased investor demands for ESG data. 
Shift to the Cloud. Enterprises around the world have been shifting deployment of data management systems from on-premises to the cloud. A shift to the cloud started more than two decades ago with CRM and other front-office systems. In the last 10 years, enterprises also began adopting the cloud for managing middle- and back-office systems, owing to advantages in data security, data accessibility and total cost of operation. Having always delivered a cloud native platform, we have assisted many of our clients in adopting our cloud solutions and believe that the market has shifted to a cloud first or in many cases a cloud only set of purchasing requirements.
Digital Transformation. While the importance of digital transformation has been increasing in recent years, we believe that the pandemic accelerated that need and underscored the critical importance of collaborative cloud platforms for reporting and disclosure. As the world economy underwent increasing disruption, we believe that those companies that have embraced digital transformation were better able to maintain business continuity and improve productivity. Each of our fit-for-purpose solutions helps in critical aspects of our customers’ digital transformation journeys and simplifies the complex work around reporting and disclosure.
Remote and Hybrid Work Environments. We believe that remote and hybrid work are here to stay. To attract and retain talent in the marketplace of knowledge workers, enterprises are responding to pressure to adopt more flexible work environments. Companies that manage a growing number of digital workplace employees are implementing collaborative technologies to streamline work processes and automate decision-making, actions and responses. 
Influx of disparate data sources. As organizations capture and collect more data in more systems, the assembly, aggregation, and consolidation of that data becomes more complex. Integrating with and connecting to source systems and applications is one of the key requirements to address the technical complexity of reporting and disclosure, and is top of mind for the organizations we serve. 
Increased Regulatory Environment. The regulatory environment continues to expand globally in both scope and complexity. Regulations are increasing as are demands for more data and disclosure. Regulators are also demanding greater use of structured, machine-readable data in companies’ disclosures. Many regulators have already or will be implementing structured data mandates, requiring companies to tag data in their financial statements using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”), which is a royalty-free, international standard designed specifically for digital reporting of financial, performance, risk and compliance information. XBRL provides a unique, machine-readable tag for individual disclosures within business reports. To our knowledge, 60 countries have issued over 180 mandates for XBRL, and we expect use of the standard to continue to grow. 
Increased Investor Demands for ESG Data. We believe it is more critical than ever for companies to be transparent and accountable not just to shareholders and investors but to all stakeholders: employees, customers, suppliers, partners and communities. Today, more than ever, environmental impact, social responsibility and corporate governance are impacting the valuations of companies and the ability of institutions to invest in those companies. ESG reporting is complex. It requires the ingestion, capture, management, and reporting of financial and non-financial data from many disparate sources, and it requires the collaboration of multiple internal stakeholders. 
Growth Vectors
We are focusing investment on five major growth opportunities: global expansion, ESG, European Single Electronic Format (“ESEF”), capital markets, and our partner ecosystem.
Global Expansion. We believe growth outside of North America presents an attractive opportunity because the factors that drive demand for our solutions in North America are similar to those in other developed countries, including the need to manage complex datasets, reduce errors and risk, improve efficiency and respond to regulatory requirements. In 2021, attendees from 108 countries attended our virtual annual user conference Workiva Amplify. 
In 2021, we generated approximately 10% of our consolidated revenue from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”), and we expect these global markets to contribute an increasing percentage of total revenue. 
Environmental, Social, Governance Reporting. We plan to accelerate our investments to meet stakeholders’ growing need for ESG information. In an increasingly transparent world, organizations across the globe are disclosing non-financial key performance indicators around environmental, social, and governance issues. ESG-related information is beginning to appear in mainstream financial reports like 10-Ks and we believe this trend will accelerate in the coming years. Workiva’s fit-for-purpose ESG solution provides an effective platform to help organizations manage, collaborate, and disclose their ESG information to stakeholders.
European Single Electronic Format. We believe ESEF is an accelerator for modernization of corporate reporting in Europe. ESEF is an annual financial reporting regulation specified by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”). The ESMA mandate requires all specified issuers on European Union (“E.U.”) regulated markets to file annual account statements in a digital format using iXBRL. The key driver for ESEF is greater transparency and requires standardized reporting, consistently structured and accessible for stakeholders, thus we believe making it an ideal fit for Workiva.
Capital Markets. Capital Markets aligns well with Workiva’s product and platform offering. We have an end-to-end technology platform supporting our customers throughout their journey as they move from being a privately held company to being publicly traded. We believe that our platform approach and fit-for-purpose solutions provide a competitive differentiation in the market. Private companies can purchase the Workiva platform for financial reporting, management reporting and controls management. They may do this up to a year or two in advance of their target initial public offering (“IPO”) date. As these companies go through the IPO process, they then have the opportunity to use the capital markets solution on our platform to manage the creation of their Form S-1 to register their securities with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Around the time they go public, many of these customers may then purchase our SEC solution, which enables companies to prepare and file all major SEC reports, and expand the use of our platform to support their audit requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”).
Partner Ecosystem. We believe that our ecosystem of partners extends our geographic reach, accelerates the usage and adoption of our platform, and enables more efficient delivery of professional services. We intend to expand and deepen our relationships with global and regional partners, including global consulting firms, systems integrators, large and mid-sized independent software vendors and implementation partners. Our advisory and service partners offer a wider range of domain and functional expertise that broadens our platform’s capabilities and promotes Workiva as part of the digital transformation projects they drive for their customers.
Workiva Solutions
We organize our sales and marketing resources into four solution groups: Regulatory Reporting, Non-Regulatory Reporting, Integrated Risk and Financial Services.
Regulatory Reporting
Changing regulations and mandates create complexity in regulatory and compliance reporting, which is often executed by teams distributed across different departments and geographies within organizations. While changes to future regulations are unpredictable, we expect demand for our platform to remain strong owing to its ability to improve transparency, accountability and insight into data.
ESG Reporting. Our platform streamlines the entire ESG process from automating data collection, utilizing frameworks, and integrating financial and non-financial data, including from disparate ESG sources. It enables organizations to deliver high-quality disclosures to their most important stakeholder by connecting information directly into sustainability reports, surveys, statutory disclosures, annual reports, SEC filings, earnings call scripts, and also enables XBRL tagging. 
SEC and System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR”) Reporting. Our platform gives customers control over the entire SEC reporting process, from data collection to drafting to embedding supporting documentation to the actual filing with Inline XBRL. Our SEC reporting solution allows our customers to prepare and file all major SEC reports, such as Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, as well as Form S-1 and other registration statements, proxy statements and Section 16 reports. Features tailored to the SEC reporting process include the capability to concurrently create reports in the HTML format required for filing on the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) system and the ability to perform XBRL tagging as well as to submit SEC reports with Inline XBRL. Foreign Private Issuers can use our platform to include XBRL tagging in their 20-F and 40-F filings with the SEC. Workiva also enables customers to create earnings press releases, earnings call scripts, presentations and other investor relations materials with data linked to the corresponding filing. Canadian issuers can use our platform to draft and submit reports through SEDAR.
ESEF Reporting. We market our platform in Europe to help companies comply with the ESMA mandate to use Inline XBRL for its ESEF taxonomy. More than 5,000 European issuers are subject to the required taxonomy for their annual financial reports.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) Reporting. We market our platform to help companies comply with the FERC XBRL mandate. More than 200 utility, natural gas, oil pipeline and centralized service companies are required to file quarterly and annual reports using XBRL.
Global Statutory Reporting. We see growing demand for our platform in the U.S. and in Europe for statutory reporting, which is a complex process for our multinational customers that are required to report statutory financial information throughout different countries and local jurisdictions where they do business. Currently, most of these enterprises rely on hundreds of legacy word-processing documents and spreadsheets with no digital audit trail. This disconnected, manual process is prone to errors and creates risk of accounting inconsistencies in reports between legal entities across jurisdictions. Without a standardized process and central oversight, companies face enormous risk and high expenses related to outsourcing to a bevy of consultants and accounting firms, which weakens control and extends review time. 
Government Regulatory Reporting. State and local governments use our platform to streamline and modernize Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (“CAFR”) and budgeting. We are also expanding adoption of our platform across U.S. government agencies. With our FedRAMP authorization, we can help federal agencies connect, control and report up to 80 percent of their information types. 
Non-Regulatory Reporting
Public and private companies, government agencies and higher-education institutions must create a vast array of complex financial and managerial reports. Organizations of all sizes typically have to collect, track, manage and report on a wide range of operating metrics to drive better business outcomes. Our customers continuously find new use cases across their organizations, including Financial Planning and Analysis (“FP&A”), board/committee and quarterly reporting, C-Suite reporting, strategic business plans, financial statements, variance reports, monthly management reports, managing and tracking key performance indicators, data collection for domestic sales, performance reporting and employee benefit financial statements.
Integrated Risk
We sell our platform to teams that work in SOX compliance, internal audit management, enterprise risk management and policy and procedure management.
SOX Compliance. Our customers use our platform to increase efficiency in documenting, implementing and assessing internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”) as required by SOX. SOX also requires public company CEOs and CFOs to individually certify that their annual and quarterly financial reports are accurate and complete and to assess the effectiveness of their ICFR. Increased scrutiny from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board on audits of management’s assessment of internal controls – and the transition in the framework used for assessing internal controls – is driving public companies to find more efficient and accurate solutions for SOX compliance. Our customers can collect data from multiple departments, centralize that information in a linked platform, create and track process narratives and flows with co-workers, embed evidence and directly test controls. 
Internal Audit Management. We sell to the broad-based audit market because users in that market often collaborate with colleagues working in SOX, risk and controls across an organization. Internal audit management extends throughout an organization, attracting Workiva customers from a wide range of departments. Internal audit management includes audit risk assessments, the audit planning process, workpaper management, testing, issues management and audit reports that encompass the audit committee report and the internal audit group. Workiva enables simultaneous collaboration with control and accountability and enables robust documentation, accurate audit conclusions and complete audit trails, which are essential to auditors, executives and boards. With permission controls, administrators can restrict access at all levels for each user to create, review and edit data and documents that relate directly to them. This control feature also enables users to grant access to their external auditors, which further streamlines the review process and reduces expenses. 
Enterprise Risk Management. With our platform, our customers can integrate their risk management practices throughout the organization while maintaining information privacy, audit trails and security resulting in highly efficient and transparent compliance. We also sell a solution for ERM to help enterprises identify systemic risks, determine risk probabilities, assess risk magnitude, plan strategic responses, report to boards and other stakeholders and ultimately make real-time ERM decisions.
Policy and Procedure Management. Our customers can use our platform to establish a connected, enterprise-wide policy and procedure management process. Teams can access and manage all content for policies, standards, procedures and guidelines for the entire enterprise in our platform, and they can efficiently manage ongoing policy review cycles throughout the year. Customers can map policies directly to risks, controls, processes and regulations and create a consistent template-driven format or taxonomy for all policies. Customers can also distribute and track employee attestation of policies and procedures with automated certification reminders and progress dashboards. 
Financial Services
We market our platform to address regulatory compliance risk and enterprise risk at banks, insurance companies and other financial services companies. Examples of regulations facing our customers include the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III, Capital Requirements Regulation (“CRR”), Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD”), Resolution and Recovery Plans (“RRP”), Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”), and Dodd-Frank Stress Testing (“DFAST”). We also help investment management companies streamline industry-specific compliance and capital markets transactions.
We also market our platform to help organizations comply with the European Banking Authority’s Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (“SREP”), which requires institutions to report on their Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (“ICAAP”) and the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (“ILAAP”). In addition, our platform helps financial services firms in the UK comply with regulations from The Financial Conduct Authority, which requires reporting under the Client Asset Sourcebook (“CASS”) rules for registered firms who hold or control client money or custody assets.
Workiva Platform
The Workiva platform is single instance, multi-tenant software deployed in the cloud. Our platform, built on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, is composed of both proprietary and open-source technologies. Customers can access Workiva solutions with any standard web browser. 
We believe the following characteristics highlight our platform’s key competitive advantages:
Features and Functionality. Our platform allows customers to connect data from ERP, GRC, HCM and CRM systems, as well as other third-party cloud and on-premise applications with complete control, context, and clarity. Workiva's drag-and-drop data transformation and preparation capabilities deliver previews and provide insights on the fly. Organizations can simply extract data from sources into the Workiva platform where they can perform queries, filter, and clean the datasets, and do it across millions of records that typical spreadsheets can’t handle. Once the data is connected in the Workiva platform, users can automate data and workflow updates, track every change and seamlessly collaborate with colleagues to create trusted reports and regulatory filings.
With our platform’s data-linking capabilities, every change is automatically updated in all linked instances—including narrative and numbers—throughout spreadsheets, word-processing documents, charts and graphs, presentation decks and dashboards in our platform. Linking enables data consistency and ensures that collaborators are working with the most current data. 
Our platform's detailed audit trail provides accountability and transparency by tracking every change made by every user over time. A complete record of data provenance and all changes helps our customers mitigate risk, gain insights and make better, data-driven decisions.
 With permission controls in our platform, administrators can manage access at all levels so each user can create, review and edit data and documents. This control feature also enables users to grant access to their external auditors, outside counsel and other consultants, which further streamlines the review process and reduces expenses. 
Easy to Deploy and Configure. The Workiva platform can be deployed within days or weeks for new customers and can be easily configured by the customer for individual employees or entire teams. Because our solutions are browser-based, customers avoid costly, time-intensive deployments typically associated with on-premise enterprise software.
High Performance. The architecture, design, deployment and management of our solutions provide enterprise-grade scalability, availability and security. The performance of the Workiva platform has been tested and proven by some of the largest, most demanding enterprises in the world. 
Continuous Improvement. Frequent collaboration with customers and development iteration allow us to make continuous improvements by releasing a new version of our platform several times each week. 
Scales Rapidly. The Workiva platform is designed to support millions of end users as a result of its scalability and our relationship with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. A number of our customers have reported millions of links to single sources of data, among multiple documents, spreadsheets and presentations, without any discernible negative effects on performance. 
Secure. Many of the largest enterprises in the world trust us with their most sensitive data. We employ stringent data security, reliability, integrity and privacy practices. In addition to our regular customer security assessments, we engage in continuous and ongoing penetration and vulnerability testing (manual and automatic, internal and third-party) and adhere to standards established by third parties such as FedRAMP and ISO 27001. We also engage third-party auditors to evaluate our controls against the service organization controls (“SOC”) compliance frameworks.
Marketplace. The Workiva Marketplace enables organizations to streamline existing processes and solve new business problems by activating more than 140 ready-made templates, 70+ no-code data connectors, and services from industry experts and trusted partners — all within the Workiva platform’s connected and secure ecosystem. Its offerings include process checklists, carefully organized and linked reports, style guides, perfectly formatted presentations, and more. Accounting, sustainability, audit, financial planning & analysis, financial services, and legal teams can easily add templates or connectors directly into an existing Workiva workspace and optimize workflow with process automation, practical examples, and industry best practices.
Recent Platform Milestones
In January 2021, we completed the migration of all Workiva customers onto our new platform, which is faster and more scalable with dozens of new capabilities, including improved real-time collaboration, new data importers and exporters, multi-monitor support, drag and drop capabilities, better charts, Workspaces for teams, additional languages and currencies, an improved filing wizard and additional ways to link data.
In April 2021, we launched our newest fit-for-purpose solution, ESG. This end-to-end solution empowers businesses to keep pace with the demand from regulators, ratings agencies, institutional investors and other stakeholders for trusted, transparent data and proof of ESG forward-looking business goals. 
In July 2021, we launched the Workiva Marketplace, filled with more than 140 Workiva-built and partner templates, services and 70+ no-code connectors that streamline existing processes and solve new business problems all within the Workiva cloud platform’s connected and secure ecosystem. 
In August 2021, we announced the strategic tuck-in acquisition of OneCloud, a pioneer in integration platform as a service (“iPaaS”) technology. We acquired OneCloud to extend our platform capabilities in data integration and preparation. OneCloud had been an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partner of ours since July 2019. OneCloud’s technology expanded the Workiva platform, enabling our customers to connect data from third-party sources, such as ERP, GRC, HCM and CRM systems, as well as other third-party cloud and on-premise applications. We believe connecting, harmonizing and controlling data across multiple, disparate source systems further differentiates the Workiva platform. By acquiring OneCloud, we now fully own the complete end-to-end technology of our platform.
In September 2021, we launched a new data preparation capability within the Workiva platform (“Data Prep”) that streamlines compliance reporting and empowers collaboration among financial and operational teams across organizations. Data Prep enables everyday business users as well as financial professionals to cleanse, transform, and map incoming data from enterprise systems of record via a simple, no-code interface. Data Prep provides dozens of prebuilt transformations that address the most common data preparation activities, eliminating inconsistencies caused by varying data definitions and harmonizing data into a single reporting standard, easily and intuitively.
In December 2021, we announced the acquisition of AuditNet. AuditNet created the world’s first online portal for the global audit community and serves as a primary communications resource with a digital network where 160,000+ audit practitioners access and share content, resources, and audit program tools and templates. AuditNet’s content guides internal auditors through changing regulations, emerging risks, different approaches to testing, and new risk and control frameworks. Workiva’s acquisition of AuditNet adds to our integrated risk offering and ensures that organizations of all sizes and maturity can turn to the Workiva platform to quickly scale their teams, strengthen risk assurance and greatly improve efficiency in the audit process. The acquisition comes on the heels of Workiva being named a Leader in The Forrester WaveTM: Governance Risk and Compliance Platforms Q3 2021 Report, and showcases Workiva’s investment in and commitment to the future transformation of audit.
In December 2021 we completed the acquisition of Arelle, the only open-source XBRL validation engine that transforms and improves data quality, transparency and trust for global businesses. Arelle technology is already deeply integrated into the Workiva platform, utilized by all Workiva solutions that use XBRL, including SEC reporting, FERC reporting, global statutory reporting, ESEF and ESG.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and validation of our platform and fit-for-purpose solutions. We focus on innovating and developing new solutions and furthering the openness and extensibility of our platform. We believe that delivering new functionality for our customers is an integral part of our product strategy and provides our customers with access to a broad array of options and information critical to enhancing their reporting, disclosure and digital transformation efforts. We have made, and expect that we will continue to make, significant investments in research and development to broaden our platform capabilities, strengthen our existing solutions, enhance our user experience, and develop new solutions. We focus on customer engagement to envision the future of our platform to bring about new capabilities and versions of existing solutions to market quickly in order to remain competitive in the marketplace.
Customers
Thousands of organizations, including global enterprises with hundreds of thousands of employees, trust Workiva. As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 4,300 customers. Our customers are passionate, loyal supporters of our solutions, as demonstrated by our subscription and support revenue retention rate of 97.0% as of the December 2021 measurement date. Our subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-on solutions was 110.0% as of December 31, 2021.
Competition
The intensity and nature of our competition vary significantly across our different solutions, as changes in regulation and market trends result in evolving customer requirements and demand for enterprise software. Our primary competitors include: 
•Status quo, manual business processes that rely on legacy software productivity tools;
•Diversified enterprise software providers;
•Niche software providers that provide point solutions;
•Providers of professional services, including consultants and financial printers;
•Governance, risk and compliance software providers; and
•Business intelligence / performance management software providers.
As our markets expand, we expect to compete with more highly specialized software vendors, as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively. 
The principal competitive factors in our market include: product features, reliability, performance and effectiveness; product line breadth, diversity and applicability; product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures; price and total cost of ownership; adherence to industry standards and certifications; strength of sales and marketing efforts; and brand awareness and reputation. We believe that our cloud-based platform has the combination of features and value to our customers that will continue to allow us to compete effectively. 
Sales and Marketing
Our “land-and-expand” sales strategy focuses on acquiring new customers and selling additional solutions to existing customers. We believe that we have penetrated only a small fraction of our market opportunity. We intend to continue investing in sales and marketing to drive growth in the U.S., Canada, Europe and parts of the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. 
Sales
Our sales organization employs a combination of field sales, inside sales and partnership channels. 
Our sales organization comprises sales development representatives, pre-sales engineers and account managers. Our sales development representatives qualify sales-accepted opportunities for our account managers. Our pre-sales engineers focus on solutions and custom product demonstrations and consultative sales. Our account managers work to attract new customers as well as expand our platform into new use cases and departments across our current customers’ organizations. 
Our customer success and professional services teams also help our account managers build our existing customer relationships by providing advice and best practices that enable users to harness the full power of our platform.
We plan to continue strengthening our sales coverage in our current markets, as well as expand our sales footprint in locations where we see a demand for our solutions. To achieve this growth, we plan to continue hiring motivated sales people with experience in enterprise software sales and in specific geographical regions. We believe that our approach to hiring sales people, along with a progressive training, culture and compensation package will allow us to retain sales talent and continue to drive growth.
In 2021, we continued to expand our ecosystem of partners, including global consulting firms, systems integration and technology firms, and leading regional consulting firms. Our highly skilled advisory and implementation partners offer a wide range of subject-matter expertise that broadens our platform’s capabilities and promotes Workiva as part of the digital transformation projects they implement for their customers. Our technology partners enable powerful data and process integrations that enable our customers to connect their existing ecosystem of solutions directly to our platform. Our partners help to extend our customer reach through marketing and promotion and help accelerate the sale and delivery of our platform.
Marketing 
Our marketing organization promotes our brand, generates demand for our offerings, and researches and assesses product market needs. Our advance planning team assesses customer needs, conducts industry-based research and identifies new markets. Our product marketing team develops the go-to-market strategy for Workiva solutions and manages pricing and licensing strategies. The product marketing team also supports our sales team with playbooks that include profiles of typical buyers, key messages, value propositions, competitive analysis and sales strategies. 
Our demand generation programs are categorized by technology solution and industry and are focused on engaging business leaders, process owners and technology teams. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target current and prospective customers. Our marketing team hosts virtual and in-person events to educate prospects and customers and generate demand for our solutions. 
Customer Success and Professional Services
Our customer success and professional services teams help our account managers build relationships with customers by providing advice that enables them to harness the full power of our platform. 
Customer Success. Our customer success team partners with users of our platform to understand their business objectives and offers best practices in the use of our software. We deliver 24/7 live customer support via phone, digital messaging and web-based conferencing. We provide intensive training to our customer success team and segment them for each solution and market focus.
Professional Services. Our professional services include initial setup of documents; XBRL mapping, tagging and review; best practices implementation; and business process consulting. Our XBRL team of accounting and financial reporting professionals provide XBRL mapping, tagging and review services to our customers. We also employ a team of consultants who offer services to customers to improve and streamline their Workiva-related data processes. 
We pay for employees to maintain professional certifications and licenses that are important to our customers, and we host regular company-wide employee education sessions on business, industry, technology and workplace topics.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the United States and other jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 63 issued patents and 15 patent applications pending relating to our platform. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow or otherwise limit our claims. Any patents issued may be contested, designed around, found unenforceable, or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We also license software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses, and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade-secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
If we continue to be successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop solutions and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our platform infringes their proprietary rights.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the enterprise software industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, may assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us, and our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify our customers against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain solutions or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages (including enhanced damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents, copyrights or other proprietary rights.    
We have registered a number of trademarks and logos, including “Workiva,” “Wdesk” and “Wdata” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in several jurisdictions outside the United States. We have also registered other trademarks in the United States and in other jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and we cannot assure you that these names will be available for use in all such jurisdictions.
Litigation
From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of any currently pending legal proceedings to which we are a party will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Government Regulations
We believe that our businesses and operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable government laws and regulations. Any additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations. Various legislative and administrative regulations applicable to us have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on our revenues, earnings or cash flows. However, if new or amended laws or regulations impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our business, our capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information.
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
We believe society expects more from the business community: authenticity, trust, truth, and transparency. These expectations lie at the heart of what Workiva does for customers and ourselves. We are committing to ESG through authentic and purposeful action—supporting our people and customers, protecting the environment, and conducting good business practices. When it comes to our company’s ESG responsibilities, Workiva tracks a course for consistent progress and excellence. We’ve established a guiding ESG strategy to ensure that we advance trust and belonging in our workforce and industry, stand for truth in our customer and partner interactions and in marketing practices, and stay consistently transparent about our impact with society and our employees across our value chain.
Along with the creation of our ESG strategy, we have also created our ESG governance structure, materiality approach, stakeholder engagement process, and alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures (TFCD). To learn more about Workiva’s ESG efforts, track our progress in developing forward-looking commitments and key performance indicators, go to workiva.com/sustainability.

Workiva offers market-competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain the best employees.
By staying true to our company values, we have become a stronger and even more innovative team. As of December 31, 2021, Workiva employed 2,106 full-time people worldwide. Our headcount as of December 31, 2021 increased 22.6% from 1,718 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020. 
Innovation thrives when people feel welcomed, valued, respected, and heard. Diversity, equity and inclusion are core values at Workiva, and an important component of our social commitment in our ESG strategy. We strive to create a workplace where everyone is comfortable bringing their best, authentic self to work every day. As we scale, we know that continuing to develop our workforce is essential to our growth.
Workiva fosters a work environment that encourages fairness, teamwork, and respect among all employees. We value all backgrounds, beliefs and interests, and we recognize this diversity as an important source of our innovation and success. We believe that our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion increases employee engagement, empowerment and satisfaction. As of December 31, 2021, women represented 39% of our global workforce and 33% of our leadership (director and above). As of December 31, 2021, 18% of our U.S. employees and 15% of our U.S. leadership (director and above) were from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. Increasing diversity in our workforce and key operational leadership roles will remain an organizational priority. Current key initiatives include Employee Resource Groups (“ERG”), learning and development and talent acquisition. The Company maintains its ERG chapters globally across seven categories: Ethnic diversity, LGBTQ+, Veterans, Women in Technology, Women in Sales, Parents and Caregivers, and Employees who work remotely. Each ERG is sponsored and supported by senior leaders across the enterprise.
The health and safety of our colleagues and anyone who enters our workplace around the world is of paramount importance to Workiva. As part of our ongoing response to the global pandemic of respiratory disease (abbreviated “COVID-19”), we continued reopening our offices in 2021 with reduced capacity due to local business necessities, differences in laws, culture and employee needs. We have had to close certain offices at different times during the year to account for developments related to 
COVID-19, and in accordance with local laws and regulations. For those offices that have remained open, we have advised all employees that working from home is the safest course of action. Additionally, in order to maximize the health and safety of our workforce and promote transparency about our plans, we continued with bi-monthly communication from senior leaders regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on the workforce and the Company and work from home flexibility, while initiating new protocols across all offices under the direction of our COVID-19 task force.
None of our U.S. employees is represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, employee compensation and benefits accounted for approximately 83% of our total operating expense.
