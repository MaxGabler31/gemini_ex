Item 1. Business.
 
This business description should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”), which are incorporated herein by this reference.
 
Company Overview
 
Fluent, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Fluent,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is an industry leader in data-driven digital marketing services. We primarily perform customer acquisition services by operating highly scalable digital marketing campaigns, through which we connect our advertiser clients with consumers they are seeking to reach. We deliver data and performance-based marketing executions to our clients, which in 2021 included over 500 consumer brands, direct marketers and agencies across a wide range of industries, including Media & Entertainment, Financial Products & Services, Health & Wellness, Retail & Consumer and Staffing & Recruitment.
 
We attract consumers at scale to our owned digital media properties primarily through promotional offerings and employment opportunities. To register on our sites, consumers provide their names, contact information and opt-in permission to present them with offers on behalf of our clients. Approximately 90% of these users engage with our media on their mobile devices or tablets. Our always-on, real-time capabilities enable users to access our media whenever and wherever they choose.
 
Once users have registered with our sites, we integrate proprietary direct marketing technologies and analytics to engage them with surveys, polls and other experiences, through which we learn about their lifestyles, preferences and purchasing histories. Based on these insights, we serve targeted, relevant offers to them on behalf of our clients. As new users register and engage with our sites and existing registrants re-engage, we believe the enrichment of our database expands our addressable client base and improves the effectiveness of our performance-based campaigns.
 
Since our inception, we have amassed a large, proprietary database of first-party, self-declared user information and preferences. We have permission to contact the majority of users in our database through multiple channels, such as email, home address, telephone, push notifications and SMS text messaging. We leverage this data in our performance offerings primarily to serve advertisements that we believe will be relevant to users based on the information they provide, and in our data offerings to provide our clients with users' contact information so that our clients may communicate with them directly. We have also begun to leverage our existing database into new revenue streams, including utilization-based models, such as programmatic advertising.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded revenue of $329.3 million and $310.7 million, net (loss) of ($10.1) million and net income of $2.2 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $23.2 million and $41.2 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP"), adding back income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, and other adjustments. See our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this 2021 Form 10-K, and for further discussion and analysis of our results of operations, including a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA from net income (loss), see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Market Opportunity
 
According to eMarketer, aggregate spending on digital media exceeded aggregate spending on offline media in the U.S. for the first time in 2019. Industry spending on digital media is projected by eMarketer to have exceeded $211 billion in 2021, representing approximately 67% of total media spend in the U.S., and to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.5% through 2025. Of this total media spend, the predominant component is expected to represent media spend on mobile platforms with a growing demand on advertising video that's projected to grow from 127.7 million to 164.0 million viewers in 2025, according to eMarketer. Further, according to a recent study by McKinsey, investments in data-driven marketing solutions will triple from $900 million in 2018 to $2.6 billion in 2022.
 
According to the Winterberry Group, marketers spent approximately $29 billion on data and related services and solutions in 2021 in the U.S., data-related tactics as a percentage of total media spend will grow from 11.6% in 2021 to 12.3% in 2022. Further, marketers are increasing their focus and spend on recognizing consumer identities and tracking consumer behaviors across channels and devices, rather than simply targeting their advertising based on anonymized online behaviors.

Key Challenges Facing our Clients
 
While performance-based pricing models dominate digital media spend, we believe that a significant portion of such spend represents an intermediary step in an advertiser’s process of securing new customers, such as a click on a banner advertisement. According to The Nielsen CMO Report, only one in four marketers reports a high level of confidence in their ability to measure the return on investment, or ROI, of their media spend. We believe advertisers are operating in an environment where greater accountability is being mandated and, therefore, are increasingly focused on the ability to precisely measure return on their media spend.
 
In addition, many companies seeking to learn more about their existing customers or target new customers either gather data themselves or purchase data to inform their advertising and marketing strategies. However, the data they obtain is often either not first-party, not sufficiently recent or not sufficiently complete. Moreover, these companies may not have the ability to capture real-time signals that are indicated by a consumer’s behavior, even if it is observable. As a result, we believe many companies who offer products and services to consumers do not have ready access to accurate consumer data or timely alerts through which they could programmatically target their advertising, nor the ability to resolve data sets and thereby confirm consumer identities or enrich data profiles.
 
Our Offerings and Solutions
 
We primarily provide performance marketing solutions to our clients based on their desired outcomes, or specific actions in their marketing funnels, including the submission of a registration form, an app installation or a completed transaction. Our owned and operated media properties include Flash Rewards, The Smart Wallet and Find Dream Job in order to meet our clients need. We believe our solutions are well-aligned with the needs and objectives of our clients, providing measurability, scalability and flexibility. In addition, by using the data consumers provide about themselves when registering on our sites, our advertiser clients are able to reach the precise audiences they are targeting through the modes of contact these consumers prefer and at the times they are most receptive to being contacted.
Performance Campaigns
 
For clients who seek the completion of certain actions by consumers, such as the submission of a registration form, the installation of a mobile application or a trial subscription of a good or service, we provide performance campaigns that meet the criteria specified by the client.
 
We bear the cost and risk of paying various media sources to generate consumer traffic to our digital media properties or to media properties owned or operated by our clients, without the assurance of a subsequent revenue-generating event from such activity. By leveraging our scale and expertise in acquiring consumer traffic, we work with our clients to define billable events and pricing tolerances that meet both our and our clients' profitability objectives, the latter of which may be difficult for them to achieve themselves economically, if at all.
 
Consumer Data 
 
For clients who prefer to contact consumers through means such as direct mail, email, telephone, messaging and other channels by which they can operate or manage a campaign, we generally transmit contact information for consumers who meet certain qualifications that we develop with the client. We generate revenue through the delivery of qualifying data and through certain performance-based triggers that may be met based upon the client’s subsequent efforts to contact and market to such consumers.
 
The data records we provide contain varying depths of user profiles, ranging from basic contact information to in-depth self-declared preferences and behaviors. We believe the scale and depth of first-party, self-declared information captured in our database and reflected in our data profiles is a competitive advantage in the industry. Many other providers of consumer data offer data or information that is inferred from a consumer’s behavior but not directly observed or stated by such a consumer. We believe our first-party data is more reliable and reflective of consumers' current interests and preferences.

Emerging Data Offerings
 
In 2018, we began to offer data sets pertaining to certain audience segments from our database in programmatic environments, thereby enabling advertisers, such as those in the healthcare industry, to leverage our data in an anonymized, privacy-minded manner to target high-intent prospects for their offerings. This offering has established commercial viability and grown considerably during the past two years. Although still representing a small percentage of our overall revenue, we believe it represents a strategically significant and incremental revenue stream for our existing database.
Social Media Campaigns
 
Through AdParlor Holdings, Inc., a provider of digital advertising solutions that includes social media buying, we offer clients a sophisticated suite of social media strategy, planning and buying, along with highly tailored creative services.
Telephony Solutions
 
Through our acquisition of a 50% interest in Winopoly, LLC, effective April 1, 2020 (the “Initial Winopoly Acquisition”), and the remaining 50% interest, effective September 1, 2021 (the "Full Winopoly Acquisition"), a contact center operation which serves as a marketplace matching consumers sourced by Fluent with advertiser clients, we now offer clients a high-value source of live call transfers and phone verified prospective customers for their businesses. Shortly after the Full Winopoly Acquisition, the Company rebranded Winopoly's contact center operations as Fluent Sales Solutions ("FSS"). Through this capability, we contact consumers by phone through FSS, thereby providing a consumer experience we believe to be both effective and of high quality. In so doing, we extend our relationship with these consumers, bringing them further along in their journey and enabling us to capture greater value from the leads we initially source.
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our competitive strengths will continue to enable us to provide a compelling value proposition to our clients and drive differentiation of our offerings in the marketplace.
Scale and Ingenuity in Purchasing Media - Our ability to effectively access, at scale, channels and sources of media that supply consumer traffic to our media properties and those of our clients has been critical to our growth. Since our inception, we have deployed approximately $1 billion in media spend. Our team has gained knowledge and experience that we believe allows us to generate higher levels of profitability from given media sources, thereby enabling us to acquire media more competitively than others. This capability allows us to run thousands of campaigns simultaneously and cost-effectively for our clients, at acceptable media costs and margins to us.
Proprietary and Innovative Technology Platform - We believe our internally developed technology platform is unique in the industry, having been purpose-built for performance marketing and developed with a mobile-first user experience in mind, since our founding in 2010. Our platform deploys proprietary machine-learning capabilities to build upon our experience with various promotional offers, consumer segments and advertisers, through which we continuously optimize our digital marketing campaigns.
Unique and Extensive Database of First-Party Consumer Information - We attract a substantial volume of consumers to our owned media properties on a daily basis and collect significant demographic, behavioral and other data as they engage with our direct marketing experiences. This data is utilized in real-time, as consumers respond to dynamically populated survey questions, thereby enabling intelligently targeted ads to be served in response. This data is also stored and analyzed and can be further enhanced as consumers return to our sites and declare and exhibit additional preferences and behaviors through additional surveying, allowing for the development of deeper insights and additional monetization opportunities.
Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe that the performance marketing industry has significant opportunities for growth. Elements of our strategy include:
 
Increasing Traffic Quality to Our Owned Digital Media Properties. As our business has grown, we have attracted larger and more sophisticated clients to our platform. To further increase our value proposition to clients and to fortify our leadership position in relation to the evolving regulatory landscape of our industry, we commenced a Traffic Quality Initiative in 2020. We believe that significant value can be created by improving the quality of traffic we source to our media properties, through higher participation rates on our sites leading to higher conversion rates, resulting in increased monetization and ultimately increasing revenue and profitability.
 
Through this initiative, we substantially curtailed the volume of lower quality affiliate traffic that we source beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020. To replace this lower quality traffic, we continue to work to source traffic that meets our quality requirements through new suppliers, channels and media buying strategies. We believe these actions will benefit the Company over time, providing the foundation to support sustainable long-term growth and positioning us as an industry leader.
 
Increasing Monetization of Our Traffic. By presenting consumers with a broad array of offers particularly curated to their preferences, as informed by their responses to our surveys and our platform’s ad serving logic, we seek to facilitate transactions that are beneficial for the advertiser, the consumer and us. As we continue to improve consumer engagement on our platform, we expect to strengthen our relationships with existing advertisers and build new relationships with potential advertisers. We continuously enhance our product offerings for consumers and targeting capabilities for advertisers to ensure we are optimizing the value of our traffic. We recently revamped our rewards program to allow more users opportunities to claim rewards at different reward values, provided more deal choices, and changed the number of deals required to get rewards. 
Developing and Enhancing Products that Increase the Quality of Our Offering to Consumers, Advertisers and Partners. Our product development efforts are intended to appeal to consumers, drive traffic, increase monetization and increase affiliate and partner opportunities. Examples of some areas on which our product development team is currently focused include designing new consumer-facing creative concepts, enhancing site experiences, developing mobile app products to expand our media footprint beyond our mobile web presence, and improving our domain reputations.

Sales and Marketing
 
We generate new client sales primarily through our in-house sales team. We service established clients through our in-house account directors and managers, who seek to optimize results for and expand our business with these clients.
Our Competition
 
Our traditional competitors have been digital marketing and database marketing services providers, online and traditional media companies, and advertising agencies. We believe the competitive landscape is changing and becoming more complex. We believe our data and our ad serving and customer acquisition technologies enable our clients to better target, engage, qualify and communicate with relevant consumers, in a more profitable manner than our competitors.
 
Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources, better name recognition and a larger customer base.
 
Concentration
 
We have an extensive list of clients across a wide range of industries. For the year ended December 31, 2021, there was a single long-standing advertiser client of the Company that accounted for 11.7% of the Company's consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any single advertiser client account for more than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenue.
Corporate History
 
On August 19, 2010, our founders, Ryan Schulke and Matthew Conlin, formed Fluent, Inc., a private corporation providing digital marketing services.
 
On March 20, 2015, the entity now known as Fluent, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware under the name Tiger Media, Inc. On April 30, 2015, Tiger Media, Inc. changed its name to IDI, Inc.
 
On December 9, 2015, IDI, Inc. completed the acquisition of Fluent, Inc., which merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of IDI, Inc. and continued as the surviving company under the name Fluent, LLC. IDI, Inc. subsequently changed its name to Cogint, Inc. on September 26, 2016.
 
On June 8, 2016, IDI completed the acquisition of QInteractive, LLC.  On January 1, 2017, IDI contributed QInteractive to Fluent, LLC which subsequently changed its name to Vesey Studios, LLC.
 
On March 26, 2018, Cogint, Inc. completed a spin-off (the "Spin-off") of its risk management business by way of a pro rata distribution of all the shares of common stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Red Violet, Inc., to its stockholders of record as of March 19, 2018 and certain warrant holders.
 
Following the Spin-off, Cogint, Inc.’s common stock continued trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ"), with our founders and management team taking over the management of the public company parent, while continuing to operate the original digital marketing business run by Fluent, Inc. since its inception.
 
On April 16, 2018, to better reflect our operations following the Spin-off, we changed our name to Fluent, Inc., and our common stock continued trading on NASDAQ under our new ticker symbol "FLNT."
 
On July 1, 2019 we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of AdParlor Holdings, Inc.
 
On April 1, 2020 we acquired a fifty percent (50%) interest in Winopoly, LLC, and acquired the remaining fifty percent (50%) interest on September 1, 2021.
 
Our Intellectual Property
 
We rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law, confidentiality agreements, and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We have filed a patent application on our ad serving and lead generation system and also avail ourselves of applicable trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our proprietary technology. With respect to our trademarks, we maintain a portfolio of perpetual common law and federally registered trademark rights across several brands and domains relating to our business units, products, services and solutions. We claim copyright protection in our original content that is published on our websites and included in our marketing materials.
Regulatory Matters
 
Our business is subject to a significant number of federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations applicable to online advertising, commercial email marketing, telemarketing and text messaging. We are also subject to laws, rules and regulations regarding data collection, privacy and data security, intellectual property ownership and infringement, sweepstakes and promotions and taxation, among others. Some of our clients operate in regulated industries, such as financial services, credit repair, consumer and mortgage lending, healthcare and medical services, health insurance including Medicare Advantage and related Medicare insurance plans and secondary education, and, to the extent applicable, we must comply with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to marketing activities in those industries. We own and operate consumer facing websites in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia and are subject to the laws, rules and regulations of those countries as they impact our operations.
 
These laws, rules and regulations, which generally are designed to regulate and prevent deceptive practices in advertising, online marketing and telemarketing, protect individual privacy rights and prevent the misuse and unauthorized disclosure of personal information, are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws, rules and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the rapidly evolving industry in which we operate.
 
See "Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters," for further discussion of the impacts of various laws, rules and regulations on our business.

Human Capital
 
Fluent is committed to providing our employees with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, comprehensive medical and wellness benefits, continuous learning, and regular programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. Our values — to connect, learn, innovate, and succeed — are foundational to our success. We embrace challenges and welcome opportunities to make our tomorrow-selves proud. As we continue to evolve and grow as an organization, we are dedicated to creating an inclusive and safe work environment where diversity is celebrated, and each person feels they belong and add a fresh, unique perspective to our business and culture. 
 
We have been the recipients of many awards for our corporate culture including being on Crains’s Best Places to Work for the last seven years.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 265 employees, of which 261 were full-time employees. This represents an increase of 17.8% over the number of employees as of December 31, 2020. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization, and none are party to any collective bargaining agreement with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages and strive to maintain a positive relationship with our team of employees. While the COVID-19 pandemic continued throughout 2021, our employees have continued to work through these challenging times, developed new skills, improved work-from-home efficiency, and demonstrated their resilience. However, as is the case with many organizations, we have experienced higher levels of turnover during the pandemic and hiring has been increasingly difficult with new hires commanding higher salaries.
 
Investing in our People
 
Competition in the recruitment of top talent within our industry is intense, and our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate and retain qualified sales and marketing, executive and administrative and technical personnel. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining qualified employees. Fluent offers generous and competitive salaries and bonus/commission plans and we currently match up to 4% of employees' contributions in their 401(k) to help our employees plan for their futures. We reward positive performance and results and celebrate our employees for their persistent drive to succeed.
 
We also prioritize the health and well-being of our people, who we want to be their best and authentic selves both personally and professionally. We offer multiple health insurance plans to choose from, on-demand instructor-led fitness and meditation sessions, and mental health resources like real-time texting therapy.
 
We also encourage curiosity and provide our people with the tools and resources to learn and grow. From internal Fluent University courses, company-wide Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) workshops and corporate She Runs It memberships, we offer continuous opportunities for personal and professional development. Through these courses, we created approximately 1,500 hours of learning for our employees to date. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we regularly held in-office events and workshops to keep our team engaged and connected. Since we implemented company-wide work-from-home beginning on March 13, 2020, we have held a number of virtual company-wide events such as virtual trivia nights, wheel of tenure and cooking classes, allowing our employees to connect and share ideas from the comfort and safety of their own homes. 
 
We provide a discretionary time off policy that does not limit vacation days and flexible work schedules to allow our team to maintain a balanced worklife schedule. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have recognized that many employees have taken on new personal responsibilities and in response, we continue to encourage our people to take the time they need for themselves and their loved ones.
 
Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion
 
We are constantly striving to make Fluent a more inclusive and compassionate place to work. Our dedicated DEI team is designed to create opportunities for connection, education, and service that drive reflection, empathy, and positive change at Fluent – as well as in our communities and industry. In 2021, our DEI team, increased the number of events by organizing five speaker series, including two sessions led by internal teams and three sessions with external guests. These events were attended by the vast majority of our work force. In 2021 our Fluent Women Leaders Employee Resource Group ("Women Leaders") emerged. Both the DEI and Women Leaders meetings provide resources to our employees, including information on upcoming networking events, mentorship programs, panels, workshops, service opportunities, and a space to discuss a wide range of topics. Additionally, we hosted company-wide bias and privilege trainings to ensure all of our employees share a foundational knowledge.
 
Additionally, at Fluent, giving back is at our core. We’ve always been strong believers in paying it forward. From the top down, our people are generous, compassionate and eager to make real impact. We organize company-wide community service days, match employees’ donations to the causes they value and support, and regularly come together as a team to help those in need. In 2021, we partnered with the Hope Program so that our employees could share their expertise to help people develop their interview skills to secure employment. People in the Hope Program consists of individuals facing deep structural barriers to employment, including histories with the criminal legal system, current and/or past homelessness, substance abuse disorders, low educational attainment and more. Our people enjoy helping others unlock their potential. This partnership will continue into 2022. We believe these service-based activities and donation matches help our employees stay engaged with and give back to their communities and help them create real change.
