    ARATANA THERAPEUTICS ®
 ﻿
 Our Company
 Aratana Therapeutics, Inc. is a pet therapeutics company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for dogs and cats. As a pioneer in pet therapeutics, Aratana’s mission is to deliver safe and effective therapeutics that elevate the standard of care in veterinary medicine. We work with companion animal veterinarians to bring new therapeutics to market that support the needs of pets and their owners.
 We were incorporated on December 1, 2010 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We have completed several licensing transactions and acquisitions to build our pipeline. The address of our principal executive offices is 11400 Tomahawk Creek Parkway, Suite 340, Leawood, Kansas 66211. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Aratana,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this 2018 Annual Report refer to Aratana Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
 We have three marketed therapeutics in the U.S., including NOCITA® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) as a local post-operative analgesia for cranial cruciate ligament surgery in dogs and as a peripheral nerve block to provide regional post-operative analgesia following onychectomy in cats; ENTYCE® (capromorelin oral solution) for appetite stimulation in dogs; and GALLIPRANT® (grapiprant tablets) for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs, which we co-promote under an agreement with Elanco Animal Health, Inc. (“Elanco”). Our Canine Osteosarcoma Vaccine, Live Listeria Vector (AT-014) is conditionally licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture’s (“USDA”) Center for Veterinary Biologics (“CVB”) and is available at approximately two dozen study sites across the United States.

     Our pipeline has multiple therapeutic candidates in development for potential treatments of feline and canine conditions with recognizable needs. For example, in 2018 we in-licensed exclusive, worldwide rights to a second-generation EP4 receptor antagonist. With the approval and initial commercial success of GALLIPRANT, the EP4 receptor antagonist’s mechanism of action has been validated as a treatment for pain and inflammation in canine osteoarthritis. We believe the therapeutic candidate, AT-019, has potential in pain, inflammation and other indications in dogs and cats. 
 Our Goal and Strategies
 Our goal is to develop and commercialize highly differentiated pet therapeutics in compelling markets. We plan to accomplish this by:
 ﻿
 Establishing brand recognition for Aratana and our innovative therapeutics.    We have strong aided brand recognition of more than 70 percent on our three therapeutics with our target customers, veterinarians, and we believe our aided brand recognition will continue to increase through continued use and promotion. We strive to establish the Aratana brand as a leader or pioneer in developing and delivering therapeutics that are highly differentiated and specifically designed for dogs and cats. Aratana is recognized for our category leadership and we are building a presence because we have fulfilled veterinarians’ need for new, innovative options. 
 Making our portfolio of pet therapeutics commercially successful.We believe we have a strong opportunity to grow our commercial success for NOCITA and ENTYCE, as well as a strong revenue stream on GALLIPRANT. Our team of veterinary medical liaisons in the field is able to partner with veterinarians to provide vet-to-vet training on our practice-building therapeutics. Our direct sales organization calls directly on veterinary clinics, works alongside distributors and collaborates with corporate accounts to make our therapeutics available in the United States.
 Building a differentiated commercial foundation.We aim to build a commercial organization with a competitive advantage – our sales representatives and veterinary medical liaisons in the field partner directly with veterinarians. We believe our sales force is highly trained and has already started to successfully unlock the potential in veterinary clinics, especially in specialty clinics. Our sales force calls and in-clinic visits are typically with the veterinarian rather than other staff members who do not prescribe therapeutics. We collaborate with veterinarians to provide education on conditions, doctor-to-doctor conversations, technician training, sampling, help with case selection and in the case of NOCITA, offer hands-on training. Our comprehensive service is unique because we are able to collaborate with a veterinarian to adjust their current treatment protocol to utilize our first-of-their-kind therapeutics. We believe our results from these mutually beneficial relationships with veterinarians show our strategy generates strong initial use and helps us drive re-orders.
 Advancing and developing our pipeline of therapeutic candidates. We have a proven ability to access innovation and translate into regulatory success as evidenced by our FDA-approved new chemical entities (“NCEs”). We have received four United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approvals of our lead therapeutic candidates and several USDA licensures in the past few years. Our therapeutic candidates are in various stages of development for cats or dogs, or both. In addition, we believe there are opportunities for lifecycle management with our therapeutics, including different formulation or delivery, additional species and additional indications. We believe our research and development team has a strong track record with safety and efficacy studies, as well as our ability to quickly and effectively earn regulatory approvals.
 Accessing innovation for our therapeutic portfolio.We believe the pet therapeutics market is compelling and there are recognizable needs for many conditions or diseases. We have identified therapeutic areas that are highly differentiated and overlap with areas of human pharmaceutical development. Our strategy is to identify candidates and when appropriate, to seek exclusive, worldwide rights to these compounds in animal health. In addition to candidates that require development, we seek opportunities to collaborate with companies where we can provide commercialization for pet therapeutics. We have built strong relationships with more than half a dozen companies we consider our collaboration partners, including: Advaxis, Inc. (“Advaxis”), Atopix Therapeutics Ltd. acquired by Chiesi Farmaceutici Spa in November 2016 (“Atopix”), Elanco, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Pacira”), RaQualia Pharma Inc. (“RaQualia”), Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (“Ajinomoto”), AskAt Inc. (“AskAt”), and Katholieke University Leuven Research and Development (“KU-Leuven”).
 Exploring global initiatives. We have a collaboration, license, development and commercialization agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) and co-promotion agreement (the “Co-Promotion Agreement”) granting Elanco exclusive rights globally outside the United States to develop, manufacture, market and commercialize our products based on licensed grapiprant rights and technology, including GALLIPRANT (collectively, “Grapiprant Products”), and co-promotion rights in the United States with regards to such products. We continue to explore other efforts to collaborate on our innovative pet therapeutics in countries outside the United States.

     Attracting and retaining personnel with robust experience in human pharmaceutical and animal health industries. In order to successfully execute our plan, we have assembled an experienced team consisting of veterinarians, scientists and other experts in their field. Our seasoned leadership team and staff members bring significant experience as veterans in the animal health or human health industries. 
 Key Developments
 During 2018, Aratana had significant achievements that affected the business, including commercial success, progress with therapeutic candidates and other corporate updates.

entyce (capromorelin oral solution) | NOCITA net product sales were $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, NOCITA net product sales increased sequentially quarter-after-quarter as a result of more than a 60% increase in the number of new accounts ordering NOCITA and an average monthly order size of $1,800. Additionally, the FDA approval in August 2018 adds a second species, cats, and second administration technique to the label. The Company has also commenced the regulatory process for a smaller, 10 mL vial size, which if approved, may allow Aratana to expand the account base from primarily specialty clinics to general practice clinics. 
nocita (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) | ENTYCE net product sales were $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 (ENTYCE was launched in the fourth quarter of 2017). In 2018, ENTYCE was ordered by more than 13,000 veterinary clinics with re-order rates of more than 70%. Market research among veterinarians also showed strong ENTYCE awareness and satisfaction with the therapeutic’s efficacy. While canine inappetence is a market that the Company expects will take time to build, the Company remains confident in its ability to grow the market and increase ENTYCE revenues. The Company plans to continue to focus on growing use by existing customers, driving usage in chronic conditions and increasing days of use. 
Galliprant (grapiprant tablets) | Aratana recorded $23.3 million in total revenues related to GALLIPRANT for the year ended December 31, 2018, which included a $15.0 million commercial milestone payment from Elanco, and compares to approximately $20.9 million in total revenues related to GALLIPRANT for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included a one-time non-recurring $1.0 million manufacturing payment and $15.5 million in product sales of finished goods prior to the assumption of manufacturing responsibility by Elanco in the third quarter of 2017. According to third-party data, GALLIPRANT is second in market share (approximately 15%) within the competitive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (“NSAID”) market and dispensed by more clinics than any other oral NSAID. Elanco reported that market demand for GALLIPRANT continues to grow and exceeded supply capacity in the fourth quarter of 2018, which resulted in GALLIPRANT backorders that impacted financial results in that quarter. Elanco anticipates backorders will clear by the end of the first quarter or early second quarter of 2019. 

  Strategic Expansion of the Pipeline. Aratana in-licensed from AskAt the exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize AT-019, an EP4 receptor antagonist therapeutic candidate with potential in pain, inflammation and other indications. With Aratana’s ability to gain approval and with initial commercial success of GALLIPRANT, the EP4 receptor antagonist’s mechanism of action has been validated as a treatment for pain and inflammation in canine osteoarthritis. 
 Corporate Recognition and Awards. In early 2018, GALLIPRANT was named Best Companion Animal Product for 2017 by Animal Pharm. In mid-2018, the Kansas City Business Journal and Ingram’s Kansas City also listed Aratana as the top growth company in the Kansas City metro area based on 2017 annual revenue growth.   
Sales and Marketing 
 We are well-positioned in what we believe to be the most attractive segment of the animal health industry – companion animals. We work with companion animal veterinarians to bring new therapeutics to market that support pets and their owners. We reach companion animal veterinarians through a variety of sales channels depending on the specific business situation for a particular therapeutic, which includes utilizing a sales force; telesales; e-commerce; corporate veterinary entities; group purchasing organizations; veterinary distributors; and commercial collaboration partners who sell to companion animal veterinarians. 
 Typically, direct selling and indirect selling are complementary efforts aimed at raising awareness of the product, generating customer interest, driving product purchases and use, as well as supporting a good customer experience. When a therapeutic would require broad geographic sales coverage or faces established competition, we may choose to co-promote with one of the larger incumbent animal health companies.

     In 2018, we gained significant sales experience with three FDA-approved therapeutics, NOCITA, ENTYCE and GALLIPRANT, and we recorded revenues from the commercialization of our therapeutics. We reported $35.4 million in total revenues in 2018 related to NOCITA and ENTYCE net product sales and GALLIPRANT licensing and collaboration revenues (including a one-time $15.0 million milestone payment from Elanco). This compares to 2017 total revenues of $25.6 million and to 2016 total revenues of $38.6 million, which primarily consisted of a one-time payment of $38.0 million from Elanco pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement.

﻿ Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $28.8 million, $28.9 million and $27.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The focus of our current commercial activities is in the United States. According to independent market research commissioned by us, there are approximately 25,000 veterinary clinics in the United States. We will continue to review opportunities for incremental expansion of the sales organization where the increase is expected to be significantly funded by incremental sales. In addition, we believe we have indirect access to the remainder of the revenue opportunity through our relationships with distributors, corporate accounts and, as in the case of GALLIPRANT, through a co-promotion arrangement. In 2019, we intend to remain focused on marketing our three FDA-approved therapeutics in four indications as we continue research and development work on our therapeutic candidate portfolio. 

  NOCITA® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to provide local post-operative analgesia for cranial cruciate ligament surgery in dogs and for use as a peripheral nerve block to provide regional post-operative analgesia following onychectomy in cats.

﻿ 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ 
NOCITA is a long-acting local anesthetic that provides up to 72 hours of post-operative pain relief. NOCITA was made commercially available to veterinarians in the United States in October 2016 through our direct sales organization. In 2018, we recorded approximately $7.5 million in NOCITA net product sales, which is more than 2.5 times higher than our net product sales of approximately $2.8 million in 2017. Net product sales have increased sequentially every quarter since its launch.

  We believe the sequential growth is also correlated to strong brand awareness of 90% among surgeons and positive experiences with the therapeutic. In 2018, there was more than a 60% increase in the number of accounts using NOCITA and in the clinics that ordered on a monthly basis, the average monthly order size was $1,800 per clinic. According to market research, veterinary surgeons feel comfortable with the NOCITA infiltration administration technique in 1-2 surgeries and cite that it only adds approximately 3-5 minutes to surgery time. The FDA approval in 2018 adds a second species, cats, and second administration technique to the label. While we believe NOCITA will continue to remain most relevant to surgeons, we have commenced the prior-approval submission process for a smaller vial size (10 mL) and if approved, we anticipate the 10 mL vial could be available in the fall of 2019. We believe having NOCITA available in a smaller volume vial size has the potential to expand our account base from the specialty clinics we currently target and add general practitioner clinics. 
 Recognizable need. We believe that there is a significant market opportunity in painful feline and canine surgeries. According to market research, approximately 10 million dogs and cats in the United States undergo painful surgeries per year, which includes amputations, knee/hip repairs, and other orthopedic or dental surgeries. There is not one established protocol for the use of pain medications in these surgeries, animal research demonstrates that pain can have a detrimental effect on healing. Pain experts are

     advocating more use of local anesthesia for pain control and 72 hours is the recommended minimum amount of time analgesics should be provided following a surgery. 
 Highly Differentiated Mechanism of Action. NOCITA is a long-acting, local anesthetic that lasts up to 72 hours post-surgery by releasing bupivacaine from multi-vesicular liposomes gradually over a period of time. The therapeutic is administered as a single dose by tissue infiltration during closure of cranial cruciate ligament surgery in dogs or as a peripheral nerve block to provide regional post-operative analgesia following onychectomy in cats. With 72 hours of pain control, NOCITA prevents analgesia gaps in the first 72 hours post-surgery and provides consistent pain control after the patient is discharged.
 Efficacy & Safety in dogs. FDA approval was based on a pivotal clinical field study in dogs undergoing knee surgery and measured pain using the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale-Short Form (“CMPS-SF”). NOCITA-treated dogs had statistically significant reduction in pain scores compared to placebo at 24, 48 and 72 hours following surgical closure. A four-week laboratory study at up to five times the labeled dose demonstrated there were no clinically relevant treatment-related effects. 
 Efficacy & Safety in cats. FDA approval was based on a pivotal field study in client-owned cats undergoing an elective onychectomy surgery. Results from the study showed NOCITA met efficacy success criteria of no required rescue analgesia using a cat-specific post-operative pain assessment tool. Cats receiving NOCITA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pain evaluation success rates at 24, 48 and 72 hours. In a 22-day laboratory safety study with cats receiving NOCITA, bupivacaine HCl or saline as a femoral nerve block, NOCITA did not produce systemic toxicity when administered on days 0, 9 and 18 at doses representing 2, 4 and 6 times the maximum labeled dose of 5.3 mg/kg/forelimb. 
 Compelling Market. Post-surgical pain can be well-controlled using a multimodal analgesic regimen that includes the combination of local anesthetics, opioids, NSAIDs and alpha2agonists. We believe the most widely used drugs approved for treatment of post-operative pain are COX-inhibiting NSAIDs in dogs. In 2017, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration implemented its initiative to reduce opioids manufactured in the United States by 25%, including opioids sold to veterinarians. We believe veterinarians will continue to be impacted by the initiative to reduce opioid use. Veterinarians also have a desire to move away from opioids because of systemic side effects, logistics, safety and potential for abuse by others in the household. NOCITA is the only long-acting local anesthetic FDA-approved for veterinary use. 
 ﻿
 ENTYCE® (capromorelin oral solution) for appetite stimulation in dogs.

﻿ 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ 
ENTYCE was made commercially available to veterinarians in the United States in October 2017 through our direct sales organization and our network of national and regional distributors. We currently market ENTYCE in three bottle sizes, 10mL, 15mL and 30mL. ENTYCE is administered as a flavored oral solution at a dose of 3 mg/kg daily and the treatment cost is based on the body weight of the dog. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the first full year of its launch, we recorded $4.6 million in ENTYCE net product sales for 2018.

  As of December 31, 2018, more than 13,000 of the approximately 25,000 veterinary clinics in the United States have ordered ENTYCE. In 2018, more than 70% of ENTYCE customers re-ordered the therapeutic. Nearly three-quarters of our targeted accounts (~4,000 clinics) have purchased ENTYCE and on average, the order size in targeted accounts in 2018 was 80% higher than orders from outside-of-territory accounts. 
 According to market research completed in June 2018 with 300 veterinarians, 70% of the veterinarians surveyed were aware of ENTYCE. Of the veterinarians who are prescribing ENTYCE, 90% cite doing so because of their belief in the therapeutic’s efficacy. Additionally, according to the same market research, approximately 20% of veterinarians surveyed prescribe ENTYCE in the acute setting (~5 days of therapy) and approximately 30% of veterinarians surveyed prescribe ENTYCE in the chronic setting (~11 days of therapy). We believe the market research signifies there is an opportunity to position ENTYCE as a first choice by differentiating the strong efficacy and safety data and emphasizing broad application. We believe, based on market research, the majority of veterinarians are currently approaching inappetence with a “wait and see” mentality – they wait to see if appetite returns without therapy, and in some cases, veterinarians continue to use therapies off-label. We remain confident in our ability to increase the awareness of the inappetence market and the benefits of using ENTYCE. We plan to continue to focus on growing use by existing customers, driving usage in chronic conditions and increasing days of use.
 Aratana is continuing to explore capromorelin for weight management in cats with chronic kidney disease and if approved, we believe the therapeutic candidate may better address weight loss in cats as a mimetic to the naturally occurring hunger hormone.

     Recognizable Need. The control of hunger and satiety involves a complex system in mammals. In many acute and chronic disease states, as well as with aging, lack of appetite is a problem and can fuel a downward spiral. Malnutrition and decreased muscle mass can result from inadequate food intake regardless of the underlying condition. Until ENTYCE, veterinarians did not have an FDA-approved therapeutic designed specifically to treat the symptom of inappetence in dogs. Inappetence can be caused by a myriad of conditions that veterinarians diagnose daily, including chronic diseases like kidney failure, gastrointestinal or heart diseases. It can also be caused by acute conditions like nausea, pain, medications or changes in diet. 
 Highly Differentiated Mechanism of Action. ENTYCE is a first-in-class ghrelin receptor agonist that works by mimicking the effect of ghrelin, the hunger hormone. Like naturally occurring ghrelin, ENTYCE binds to specific cell receptors affecting signaling in the hypothalamus, which causes the feeling of hunger.
 Efficacy & Safety. The FDA approved ENTYCE based on a pivotal clinical field study that demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of inappetent dogs receiving ENTYCE had increased appetite in the single question assessment and owner appetite assessment as compared to dogs receiving placebo. ENTYCE-treated dogs in the study also demonstrated an increase in body weight. A 12-month laboratory safety study demonstrated capromorelin was well-tolerated in dogs at daily doses up to 40 mg/kg (17.5x labeled dose).
 Compelling Market. We believe there is a significant market opportunity for a therapeutic that can safely and effectively stimulate appetite in pets. According to market research in June 2018, of the veterinarians surveyed, 95% report seeing inappetence cases in the past six months. Almost any disease can manifest or develop decreased appetite (hyporexia), complete lack of appetite (anorexia) or changes in appetite (dysrexia). Inappetence can be the first sign, and may be the only sign, that a dog is sick or has an underlying health condition. Improper food intake not only inhibits the overall health of the dog, but it can be perceived to have a negative impact on a dog’s quality of life. Pet owners can view their dog’s eating habits as the primary indicator to assess their pet’s quality of life and overall well-being. Before the launch of ENTYCE, market research showed approximately 10 million dogs presented annually in the U.S. for inappetence (decreased appetite, complete lack of appetite or altered eating patterns) and only about 4 million were treated. Before ENTYCE, therapy to address inappetence was limited to human drugs affecting the central nervous system, such as benzodiazepines, cyproheptadine and mirtazapine. However, these drugs are not approved for use in dogs, are believed to have limited effectiveness in pets and are contraindicated for cats with hepatic lipidosis. We believe some veterinarians use antiemetics to determine if the dog is nauseous. We believe a significant number of veterinarians are not prescribing these various therapies due to their limited safety and efficacy.

 GALLIPRANT® (grapiprant tablets) for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs.

﻿ | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In January 2017, GALLIPRANT was made commercially available to veterinarians in the United States through our commercial collaboration partner, Elanco, our sales organization, and distributors. Elanco recorded approximately $44.0 million in GALLIPRANT sales in 2018. Aratana recorded $23.3 million in licensing and collaboration revenues, which includes a $15.0 million commercial milestone payment based on 2018 GALLIPRANT net product sales exceeding $35.0 million within the year. The third quarter was especially strong primarily due to the re-introduction of the 100mg tablets and continued uptake of the product. | ANT SALES BY QUARTER RECORDED BY ELANCO (IN MILLIONS) Q1 2017 $5.0 Q2 2017 $4.0 Q3 2017 $6.0 Q4 2017 $8.0 GALLIPRANT was made commercially availability in the first quarter of 2017.

  According to Elanco, the fourth quarter of 2018 revenue decrease was impacted by both timing and availability of GALLIPRANT shipments. A planned shipment in late-2018 was delayed until early-2019 in order to appropriately complete the quality release process. Elanco has reported that market demand for GALLIPRANT continues to grow, exceeding supply capacity and resulting in GALLIPRANT backorders, primarily in the distribution channel, at the end of 2018, which are anticipated to clear by the end of the first quarter or early second quarter of 2019. Aratana’s 2018 licensing and collaboration revenues of $23.3 million compare to approximately $20.9 million in 2017 total revenues related to GALLIPRANT, which included a one-time non-recurring $1.0 million manufacturing payment and $15.5 million in product sales of finished goods prior to the assumption of manufacturing responsibility by Elanco in the third quarter of 2017.

     According to Elanco, GALLIPRANT is stocked by nearly 20,000 veterinary clinics in the United States and approximately 95% of those accounts have re-ordered GALLIPRANT based on data received from Elanco. According to third-party data, which was based on a sample of approximately 6,000 veterinary clinics as of December 2018, GALLIPRANT is second in market share (approximately 15%) within the competitive NSAID market and dispensed by more clinics than any other oral NSAID. In 2018, GALLIPRANT was awarded Best Companion Animal Product of 2017 by Animal Pharm.
 As part of the Collaboration Agreement, Elanco has the lead responsibility for all commercial activities globally. Until 2028, we will continue to record certain co-promotion fees and global royalties. If achieved, Aratana is also eligible for certain regulatory, manufacturing and sales milestones. Under the Collaboration Agreement, the Company is entitled to two additional payments totaling up to $60.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. Hence, the success of Grapiprant Products is very meaningful to us. See “GALLIPRANT Collaboration, License, Development and Commercialization and Co-Promotion Agreements with Elanco” for additional information.
 Canine Osteosarcoma Vaccine, Live Listeria Vector (AT-014) for the treatment of dogs diagnosed with osteosarcoma, one year of age or older. 
 In December 2017, the USDA’s CVB granted Aratana conditional licensure for Canine Osteosarcoma Vaccine, Live Listeria Vector. The therapeutic is developed by us using a listeria-based antigen delivery system in-licensed from Advaxis and is a lyophilized formulation of a modified live, attenuated strain of listeria that activates cytotoxic T-cells. The therapeutic capitalizes on the dog's immune system and its ability to attack bacterial infections, redirecting it to fight cancer cells. Data from a clinical study in 18 client-owned dogs with osteosarcoma suggests that Canine Osteosarcoma Vaccine may be able to delay or prevent metastatic disease and prolong overall survival in dogs with osteosarcoma. The single-arm study evaluated dogs that had primary tumor removal and four doses of carboplatin chemotherapy, followed by the therapeutic vaccine one dose every three weeks for three total doses. Median survival time was 956 days compared to 423 days for a historical control group (p≤ 0.05).  In the first quarter of 2018, we made the therapeutic available for purchase at approximately two dozen veterinary oncology practice groups participating in an extended field safety study across the United States. We anticipate completing target enrollment for the field safety study in 2019. The field safety study is required by USDA to progress from conditional licensure to full licensure. While the study is on-going, product purchased for use in the clinical study will offset research and development expenses. 
 ﻿
 Competition
 The development and commercialization of new animal health medicines is highly competitive, and we expect considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty animal health medicines companies. As a result, there are, and likely will continue to be, extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new animal health medicines. Our potential competitors include large animal health companies, such as Zoetis; Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc.; Elanco; Bayer Animal Health, the animal health division of Bayer AG; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Virbac Group; Ceva Animal Health; Vetoquinol and Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC. We are also aware of several smaller early-stage animal health companies, such as Kindred Biosciences; Zomedica Pharmaceuticals; VetDC; Skyline Vet Pharma; and Anivive, that are developing products for use in the pet therapeutics market.
 Osteoarthritis is a competitive marketplace and Elanco has taken the lead on commercial activities for Grapiprant Products. ENTYCE entered a new market where it is the only product approved for veterinary use to stimulate appetite in dogs. However, we are aware of an ointment FDA-approved for management of weight loss in cats that is applied to the inner pinna of the cat’s ear once daily for 14 days. NOCITA competes primarily with existing analgesics that are part of multi-modal pain protocols, including local anesthetics, opioids and cox-inhibiting NSAIDs. Regarding AT-014, we are aware that veterinarians often utilize human chemotherapy off-label to treat this disease and we are aware of a variety of investigational candidates for osteosarcoma.
 We have limited history of operations and many of our competitors have substantially more resources than we do, including both financial, personnel and technical resources. In addition, many of our competitors have more experience than we have in the development, manufacture, regulation and worldwide commercialization of animal health medicines. We are also competing with academic institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations that are conducting research in the field of animal health medicines.
 Our competitive position will be determined in part by the potential indications for which our products are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. Additionally, the timing of market introduction of some of our potential products or of competitors’ products may be an important competitive factor. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop our compounds, complete target animal studies and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors, including product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position. ﻿

Research and Development Our drug development programs focus on the development of highly differentiated compounds with the intention of capturing compelling market opportunities that will fulfill a recognizable need. We have built a development pipeline through strategically in-licensing early-stage therapeutic candidates. Our development approach provides access to promising therapeutic development opportunities within our focus areas. Even after a therapeutic is commercially available, we may conduct additional clinical studies for life cycle management purposes (supplemental indications) or for scientific exchange. Our current therapeutic candidates are regulated by the FDA or USDA. We are focused on our core strengths of clinical development of NCEs that are designed specifically for pets and navigating the regulatory environment. We continue to prioritize our development and commercial efforts with a primary focus on the United States. We have incurred and will continue to incur research and development expense as we develop our business. Our research and development expenses were $6.9 million, $15.1 million and $30.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2016, our contract development costs were correlated with several pivotal field studies and production of drug product. Since 2016, we have had fewer expenses related to pivotal field studies and production of drug product, however as pipeline programs progress to pivotal stage or we initiate new programs, research and development costs may increase.

 NOCITA® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) for use as a peripheral nerve block to provide regional post-operative analgesia following onychectomy in cats.
 On August 3, 2018, we received FDA approval to expand the NOCITA label to include use as a peripheral nerve block to provide regional post-operative analgesia following onychectomy in cats. The supplemental New Animal Drug Application (sNADA) approval is based on a multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized and masked field study of 241 client-owned cats undergoing an elective onychectomy surgery. Results from the study showed NOCITA met efficacy success criteria of no required rescue analgesia using a cat-specific post-operative pain assessment tool. Cats receiving NOCITA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pain evaluation success rates at primary and secondary endpoints. At 72 hours, NOCITA success rates were 68.4% compared to 35.3% for placebo. Separately, in a 22-day laboratory safety study with cats receiving NOCITA, bupivacaine HCl or saline as a femoral nerve block, NOCITA was well-tolerated when administered on days 0, 9 and 18 at doses representing 2, 4 and 6 times the maximum labeled dose of 5.3 mg/kg/forelimb.
 ﻿
 AT-002 (capromorelin) for cats.
 AT-002 (in-licensed from RaQualia) is a cat-specific formulation of capromorelin, a ghrelin receptor agonist. Currently, AT-002 is being evaluated in an ongoing, FDA-concurred field effectiveness study for weight management in cats with chronic kidney disease and we anticipate target enrollment will be completed in mid-2019. Once enrollment is completed, we anticipate data will readout in late-2019 with a technical section submission for efficacy to follow. In August 2018, we submitted the target animal safety technical section to the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) for AT-002 and received a technical section complete letter from CVM on February 27, 2019. In December 2018, we submitted the technical section for chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC“) for the cat-specific formulation. 
 ﻿
 AT-018 (timapiprant) for dogs.
 AT-018, which we in-licensed from Atopix following an option period between the parties, is an oral CRTH2 antagonist for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In April 2017, we initiated a pilot study evaluating timapiprant for the prevention of clinical signs of atopic dermatitis in at-risk dogs and anticipate completing target enrollment in mid-2019. We decided to extend the study, because we believe we may benefit from new regulations on CVM’s conditional approval pathway introduced with the 2018 reauthorization of the Animal Drug User Fee Act (“ADUFA”).

 AT-006 (eprociclovir) for cats.    AT-006 is an anti-viral for the treatment of feline herpes virus-induced ophthalmic conditions in-licensed from Ajinomoto. We continue to evaluate the best regulatory and commercial path forward for this program. 
 ﻿
 AT-016 (allogeneic adipose-derived stem cells) for dogs.
 In December 2017, our license partner responsible for the development of AT-016, VetStem BioPharma (“VetStem”), shared results of a pivotal study, that did not achieve protocol-defined efficacy success criteria. In January 2018, we exercised our right to terminate the license agreement with VetStem, which was effective as of mid-April 2018.
 ﻿
 AT-019.
 In February 2018, we licensed exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize AT-019 from AskAt. AT-019 is a potent and innovative EP4 receptor antagonist therapeutic candidate with potential in pain, inflammation and other indications. We executed an agreement with an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturer in 2019 and have begun transferring the manufacturing process and early formulation work. In connection with the Exclusive License Agreement with AskAt, the Company also entered into Collaboration and Option Agreement (“COA”) with AskAt for an option to acquire multiple therapeutic candidates with potential in pain, allergy and cancer. In December 2018, the Company exercised its right to terminate the COA, and on February 18, 2019, the termination became effective.
 ﻿
 Regulatory and development advances in 2018 for therapeutic candidates outside the United States: 
 Grapiprant Products.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Elanco has exclusive rights to Grapiprant Products globally outside the United States for development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization in additional species and/or indications. In January 2018, Elanco and Aratana announced the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) granted marketing authorization of GALLIPRANT in Europe. Elanco anticipates launching GALLIPRANT in Europe in the first quarter of 2019. If Elanco successfully expands the EU label for GALLIPRANT to include inflammation, we are eligible to receive a $4.0 million milestone payment, which may occur after 2019. In addition, Aratana’s contractual commitment for certain potential research and development expenses expired on December 31, 2018, in accordance with the Collaboration Agreement.
 AT-008 (rabacfosadine) for dogs in Europe.    AT-008 is a potential therapeutic candidate for canine lymphoma we sub-licensed from KU-Leuven and we have rights to develop and market the therapeutic candidate outside North America. VetDC has rights to the therapeutic candidate in North America, and it was conditionally approved by the FDA as Tanovea®-CA1 in late-2016. As Tanovea®-CA1 is established in the United States, we continue to evaluate if and how to move the therapeutic forward in Europe.
 Other therapeutics for dogs and cats in Europe.
 We have started to develop a dossier for EMA regulatory authorities on bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension in Europe. Separately, based on conversations with European National Agencies, we believe the path forward for capromorelin may be informed by studies investigating weight gain in cats.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Manufacturing and Supply Chain
 We manage third-party manufacturers to supply API, drug product and packaged product for the development and commercialization of our small molecule product candidates. We have chosen to rely on third-party contract manufacturer organizations (“CMOs”) rather than devote resources toward developing or acquiring internal manufacturing facilities.

entyce (capromorelin oral solution) | For NOCITA, Pacira is our exclusive supplier and is responsible for supplying us with finished drug product in vials. We are responsible for the labeling, packaging and shipping of NOCITA. In July 2018, we announced that we amended our agreements with Pacira to include a smaller vial size (10 mL) in addition to our 20 mL vial. We have submitted the prior-approval supplement for the 10 mL vial to FDA and if approved, we anticipate the 10 mL vial could be available in the fall of 2019.
 | In 2018, we had excess supply of ENTYCE finished goods that were manufactured after commercial launch and we incurred write-offs on these finished goods. We do not anticipate incurring significant finished goods write-offs in 2019, as our ENTYCE finished goods inventories as of year-end 2018 had been adjusted to reflect our sales expectations. The majority of our remaining ENTYCE inventories are in API, which we plan to convert to finished goods over time.

Galliprant (grapiprant tablets) | As of September 2017, Elanco assumed ownership of the New Animal Drug Application (“NADA”) and manufacturing responsibility for GALLIPRANT. If Elanco successfully establishes an alternate supply source and a technology transfer at its expense, we are eligible for a $4.0 million milestone payment, which may occur after 2019. In the third quarter of 2018, the 100 mg tablets of GALLIPRANT were re-introduced into the market after being on backorder due to isolated reports of 100 mg tablets breaking in the bottle. According to Elanco, a planned shipment in late-2018 was delayed until early-2019 to appropriately complete the quality release process. Elanco has reported market demand for GALLIPRANT continues to grow, exceeding supply capacity and resulting in GALLIPRANT backorders at the end of the year, which are anticipated to clear by the end of the first quarter or early second quarter 2019.

 Intellectual Property and License Agreements 
 We seek to protect our products and technologies through a combination of patents, regulatory exclusivity, and proprietary know-how. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current compounds and any future compounds for development, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.
 We depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
 Exclusive License Agreements with RaQualia.In December 2010, we entered into two agreements with RaQualia pursuant to which we exclusively licensed intellectual property rights relating to AT-001 and AT-002 in the animal health field. Pursuant to these agreements we obtained the rights to certain patents in the United States and other jurisdictions. The patents relating to AT-001 include composition of matter claims as well as claims to methods of use of AT-001. The patent rights relating to the use of AT-001 further include methods of preparing the compounds of interest and salts, polymorphs and intermediates thereof, as well as certain combination therapies. Additionally, we licensed from RaQualia additional patent rights relating to AT-002 that include composition of matter claims as well as claims to methods of use of AT-002. Under these agreements, we were granted exclusive, worldwide licenses to develop, manufacture and commercialize AT-001 and AT-002 in the field of animal health, except that we cannot develop, manufacture or commercialize injectable AT-001 products in Japan, South Korea, China or Taiwan. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties under these agreements. Under our agreement with RaQualia, we are responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize AT-001 and AT-002. The patent that we believe covers the crystalline form of the AT-001 compound expires on February 21, 2027 and is expected to be eligible for a patent term extension to August 2029. Certain of the AT-002 patents and applications licensed under the agreement are expected to extend out to 2034. In addition, the use of AT-002 in companion animals is protected by an Aratana patent, which expires in January 2036.
 We are responsible for contingent milestone payments upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones and royalties on net sales of licensed products, subject to certain potential offsets and deductions, under each of the AT-001 and AT-002 agreements, and the royalty percentage is in the mid-single digits. We must also pay to RaQualia a portion of royalties we receive from any sublicensees, subject to a minimum royalty on net sales by such sublicensees. Our royalty obligations apply on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, and end upon the expiration or abandonment of all patents with valid claims covering a licensed product in a given country.
 Each of the AT-001 and AT-002 agreements continues until terminated. RaQualia may terminate the AT-001 agreement or the AT-002 agreement if we fail to pay any undisputed fee under the relevant agreement and do not cure such failure within 60 days after RaQualia notifies us of such failure. We may terminate the AT-001 agreement or the AT-002 agreement, or any license granted under either agreement, on a patent-by-patent and country-by-country basis at will, upon 30 days’ prior written notice to RaQualia. Once all of the patents licensed under the AT-001 agreement or the AT-002 agreement have expired or been abandoned, the licenses granted under the relevant agreement become fully-paid and irrevocable.

     GALLIPRANT Collaboration, License, Development and Commercialization and Co-Promotion Agreements with Elanco.On April 22, 2016, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Elanco that granted Elanco rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Grapiprant Products, an FDA-approved therapeutic for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. Elanco will have exclusive rights globally outside the United States and co-promotion rights with us in the United States during the term of the Collaboration Agreement. 
 Elanco paid us an upfront payment of $45.0 million. Elanco has also agreed to pay us a $4.0 million milestone related to European approval of a Grapiprant Product for the treatment of pain and inflammation, a $4.0 million milestone related to the manufacturing of a Grapiprant Product from an alternate supply source and up to $75.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones, of which $15.0 million was achieved in 2018. The sales milestone payments are subject to a one third reduction for each year the occurrence of the milestone is not achieved beyond December 31, 2021, with any non-occurrence beyond December 31, 2023, cancelling out the applicable milestone payment obligation entirely.
 Elanco will also pay us royalty payments on a percentage of net sales in the mid-single to low-double digits. In addition, we and Elanco had agreed to pay 25% and 75%, respectively, of all third-party development fees and expenses through December 31, 2018, in connection with preclinical and clinical trials necessary for any registration or regulatory approval of the products (“Registration”), provided that our contribution to such development fees and expenses was capped at $7.0 million. We were responsible for all development activities required to obtain the first Registration for Grapiprant Products for use in dogs in each of the European Union and the United States, and Elanco was responsible for all other development activities.
 The term of the collaboration will continue throughout the development and commercialization of the product candidates, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest of (i) the date on which no valid claim of certain issued or granted patents specified in the Collaboration Agreement in the respective country exists, (ii) the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity in such country covering such Grapiprant Product, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 The Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by Elanco at any time upon 90 days’ written notice to us. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either party (i) for the other party’s material breach, where such breach is not cured within the timeframe specified by the agreement, (ii) upon the bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution of the other party, or (iii) for certain activities involving the challenge of certain patents licensed by us to Elanco. Upon Elanco’s voluntary termination or termination for Elanco’s breach, among other things, (a) all licenses and rights granted to Elanco will terminate and revert to us, and (b) Elanco has agreed to assign to us all registrations and trademarks obtained in connection with the Grapiprant Products. Upon termination for our breach, among other things, Elanco may elect to retain its rights to the licenses granted by us under the Collaboration Agreement subject to specified payment obligations.
 On April 22, 2016, in connection with the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into the Co-Promotion Agreement with Elanco to co-promote the Grapiprant Products in the United States.
 Under the terms of the Co-Promotion Agreement, Elanco has agreed to pay us, as a fee for services performed and expenses incurred by us under the Co-Promotion Agreement, (i) 25% of the gross margin on net sales of Grapiprant Products sold in the United States under the Collaboration Agreement prior to December 31, 2018, and (ii) a mid-single digit percentage of net sales of the Grapiprant Products in the United States after December 31, 2018 through 2028 (unless extended by mutual agreement).
 The Co-Promotion Agreement expires on December 31, 2028, unless extended by mutual agreement. In addition, the Co-Promotion Agreement provides that it will automatically terminate if the Collaboration Agreement is terminated early.
 Exclusive License Agreement with Pacira.On December 5, 2012, the Company entered into an Exclusive License, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with Pacira (the “Pacira License Agreement”) that granted the Company global rights for development and commercialization of licensed animal health products for NOCITA (also known as AT-003). On the same date, the Company also entered into a supply agreement with Pacira (the “Pacira Supply Agreement”, and together with the Pacira License Agreement, the “Pacira Agreements”).
 On July 5, 2018 (the “Effective Date”), the Company and Pacira entered into an amendment and restatement of the Pacira License Agreement (“A&R License Agreement”) and an amendment and restatement of the Pacira Supply Agreement (the “A&R Supply Agreement”).
 Under the A&R Supply Agreement, Pacira has agreed to manufacture and supply the licensed product in a 10 mL vial size in addition to the 20 mL vial size that is currently supplied to the Company. The supply price for the 10 mL vial size will remain fixed until December 31, 2021. Prior to December 31, 2021, the Company and Pacira have agreed to negotiate in good faith the applicable terms related to the 10 mL vial, including the price, for after December 31, 2021. If the Company and Pacira are unable to reach agreement, then as of January 1, 2022 and on each anniversary thereafter during the term of the A&R Supply Agreement, the price for the 10 mL vial will be automatically increased by a low single-digit percentage.


 

12

 
     The A&R License Agreement amended various sections of the Pacira License Agreement, including milestone payments and royalties, to incorporate the introduction of the 10 mL vial size. Prior to December 31, 2021, the Company will not be obligated to pay any royalty payments to Pacira on the sales of the 10 mL vial and thereafter, the Company and Pacira have agreed to negotiate in good faith the applicable terms relating to the 10 mL vial in accordance with the A&R Supply Agreement. The tiered royalties on the Company’s product sales of 20 mL vials remain unchanged. In addition, the A&R License Agreement reduces the annual net sales thresholds for achieving each of the potential commercial milestone payments owed to Pacira. The remaining $40,000 of commercial milestones per the A&R License Agreement begin to be triggered once NOCITA annual net sales reach $50,000 with the final tier being owed to Pacira once NOCITA annual net sales reach $250,000. Further, the A&R License Agreement lowered the minimum annual revenue payment to be provided to Pacira by the Company and delayed by one year the first period in which this minimum annual revenue payment requirement would be triggered such that the period is now expected to commence on January 1, 2023. The definition of a competing product was specified and narrowed to those injectable analgesic products preventing pain for at least 48-72 hours post-surgery as an API labeled for the control of post-operative pain for surgical veterinary use. The term of the A&R License Agreement was extended with the initial term commencing as of the new Effective Date.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had paid $2,500 in milestone payments since execution of the Pacira License Agreement, and no milestone payments were accrued. No milestones were achieved during the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company does not expect to achieve any milestones related to the A&R License Agreement in the next twelve months.
 ﻿
 Regulatory
 ﻿
 The development, approval and sale of animal health products are governed by the laws and regulations of each country in which we intend to sell our products. To comply with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes and resources to provide oversight of the development and launch of our products and their maintenance in the market.
 ﻿
 Requirements for Approval of Veterinary Pharmaceuticals for Pets
 As a condition to regulatory approval for sale of animal products, regulatory agencies worldwide require that a product to be used for pets be demonstrated to be safe for the intended use in the intended species; have substantial evidence of effectiveness for the intended use; have a defined manufacturing process that ensures that the product can be made with high quality consistency; and be safe for humans handling the product and for the environment.
 ﻿
 Safety. To determine that a new veterinary drug is safe for use, regulatory bodies will require us to provide data from a safety study generated in laboratory cats and dogs tested at doses higher than the intended label dose, over a period of time determined by the intended length of dosing of the product. In the case of the CVM, the design and review of the safety study and the study protocol are completed prior to initiation of the study to help assure that the data generated will meet FDA requirements. These studies are conducted under rigorous quality control, including Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”), to assure integrity of the data. They are designed to clearly define a safety margin, identify any potential safety concerns, and establish a safe dose for the product. This dose and effectiveness is evaluated in the pivotal field effectiveness study where the product is studied in the animal patient population in which the product is intended to be used. Field safety data, obtained in a variety of breeds and animals kept under various conditions, are evaluated to assure that the product will be safe in the target population. Safety studies are governed by regulations and regulatory pronouncements that provide the parameters of required safety studies and are utilized by regulatory bodies in the United States, the European Union, Japan and other countries.
 ﻿
 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC). To assure that the product can be manufactured consistently, regulatory agencies will require us to provide documentation of the process by which the API is made and the controls applicable to that process that assure the API and the formulation of the final commercial product meet certain criteria, including purity and stability. For FDA and EMA approvals, both pharmaceutical API and commercial formulations are required to be manufactured at facilities that practice cGMP. After a product is approved, we will be required to communicate with the regulatory bodies any changes in the procedures or manufacturing site. For example, with regard to FDA-regulated products, different reporting requirements apply depending on the scope and extent of post-approval changes to the CMC. Generally, “major changes” (as defined in the FDA’s guidance documents) require a prior-approval supplement (“PAS”) filing, which has a 120-day review period by the FDA and must be approved by the FDA before distribution or sale of the product. “Moderate changes” (as defined in the FDA’s guidance documents) can be filed as a Supplement Changes Being Effected in 30 Days (“CBE30”) or as a Supplement Changes Being Effected (“CBE-”). Products manufactured involving changes filed as a CBE30 can only be distributed and/or sold 30 days post receipt of the CBE30 by FDA or immediately if filed with the FDA as a CBE. No affirmative approval is required by the FDA for those categories of changes prior to distribution or sale. Finally, “minor changes” (as defined in the FDA’s guidance documents) are required to be provided to the FDA by companies in their annual reports on CMC application matters titled Minor Changes and Stability Reports. 
 ﻿

     Effectiveness. Early pilot studies may be done in laboratory cats or dogs to establish effectiveness and the dose range for each product. Data on how well the drug is absorbed when dosed by different routes and the relationship of the dose to the effectiveness are studied. When an effective dose is established, a study protocol to test the product in real world conditions is developed prior to beginning the study. In the case of the CVM, the pivotal effectiveness field study protocol is submitted for review and concurrence prior to study initiation, to help assure that the data generated will meet regulatory requirements. The pivotal field effectiveness study must be conducted with the formulation of the product that is intended to be commercialized, and is a multi-site, randomized, placebo-controlled study, generally with a placebo control. To reduce bias in the study, individuals doing the assessment are not told whether the subject is in the group receiving the treatment being tested or the placebo group. For pharmaceuticals, in both the United States and the European Union, the number of patients enrolled in the pivotal field effectiveness studies is required to be approximately 100 to 150 animal subjects treated with the test product and a comparable number of subjects in the control group that receive the placebo. In many cases, a pivotal field study may be designed with clinical sites in both the European Union and the United States, and this single study may satisfy regulatory requirements in both the European Union and the United States.
 ﻿
 Environmental and Human Safety. We will not be required under United States law to provide an environment impact statement for products currently in development if the products are given at the home of the pet’s owner or in a veterinary hospital. If products might result in some type of environmental exposure or release, the environmental impact must be assessed. For approval in the EU, a risk assessment for potential human exposure will be required.
 ﻿
 Labeling, All Other Information (“AOI”), and Freedom of Information Summary (“FOI”). We also will be required to submit the intended label for the product, and any information regarding additional research that has been conducted with the drug, to CVM and other regulatory bodies for review. The accepted technical sections are used to create the draft language for the FOI summary for use in the United. FOIs are published on the CVM website at the time of drug approval.
 ﻿
 Post-Approval Product Monitoring and Maintenance. Post-approval monitoring of products is required by law, with reports being provided to the CVM's Surveillance and Compliance group. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are produced in accordance with the law. Additional regulatory filings include the Periodic Drug Experience Report and the Minor Changes and Stability Report.
 ﻿
 United States
 Three federal regulatory agencies regulate the health aspects of animal health products in the United States: the FDA; the USDA; and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”).
 ﻿
 The CVM at the FDA regulates animal pharmaceuticals under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. The CVB at the USDA regulates veterinary vaccines and some biologics pursuant to the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act. The EPA regulates veterinary pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Many topical products used for treatment of flea and tick infestations are regulated by the EPA.
 ﻿
 Our current product candidates are animal pharmaceuticals regulated by the CVM and animal biologics regulated by the USDA. Manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals, including us, must show their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture. The CVM’s basis for approving a drug application is documented in a Freedom of Information Summary. We will be required to conduct post-approval monitoring of FDA- and EMA-approved pharmaceutical products and to submit reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results to the CVM’s Surveillance and Compliance group.
 ﻿
 Regulatory Process at the FDA. To begin the development process for our products in the United States, we establish an Investigational New Animal Drug (“INAD”) file with the CVM. We then hold a pre-development meeting with the CVM to reach a general agreement on the plans for providing the data necessary to fulfill requirements for a NADA. During development, we submit pivotal protocols to the CVM for review and concurrence prior to conducting the required studies. We gather and submit data on manufacturing, safety and effectiveness to the CVM for review, and this review is conducted according to timelines specified in the ADUFA legislation. Once all technical sections have been reviewed and completed – safety, effectiveness, CMC, environmental, labeling, FOI and AOI – the CVM issues a technical section complete letter. We then compile and submit the technical section complete letters as an administrative NADA for CVM review. Generally, if there are no deficiencies in the submission, the NADA is issued within 60 days after submission of the administrative NADA. After approval, we will be required to collect reports of adverse events and submit them on a regular basis to the CVM.
 ﻿
 The CVM has an alternative approval process for drugs used in minor species, or for drugs that are used for a ‘minor use’ in a major species. This process is called MUMS which stands for minor use, minor species. For example, if it can be documented that the population of cats or dogs that contract a specific condition is below a specified number, a company can apply to the CVM for MUMS designation. Once designation has been granted, then we must submit the same safety and CMC data as required for a full NADA, and also submit data to support a reasonable expectation of effectiveness. After a review period, the CVM can then grant a conditional approval. This approval allows for the commercialization of the product, while completing the pivotal effectiveness study required for a full NADA. Because in many cases the CMC section of the submission takes the longest, MUMS conditional approval may not 

 

14

 
     shorten the time to commercialization. Following submission, review and approval of the pivotal field effectiveness study, the CVM may grant a full NADA.
     Requirements for Approval of Certain Veterinary Biologics for Pets
 There are many parallels between the requirements to receive approvals for a veterinary pharmaceutical product candidates and certain veterinary biologics product candidates. The terminology differs, but the three main components are the same: efficacy, manufacturing, and safety. USDA regulations are designed to ensure that veterinary biologics are pure, safe, potent and effective. The differences compared to pharmaceutical product regulations are based on the immunological nature of the mode of action of the product and the manufacturing process involving living organisms.
 ﻿
 Efficacy. Documentation requirements depend significantly on product type and typically include data from preliminary dose determination studies and master seed immunogenicity/efficacy studies.
 ﻿
 Safety. Typical safety documentation includes safety data from laboratory animal studies, typically rodents, studies in host animals, typically laboratory dogs or cats, in biocontainment, and field safety studies conducted in client-owned animals.
 ﻿
 Manufacturing. The required documentation must include an Outline of Production, Master Seed Reports, and Summary Information Formats, or SIFs, for novel live biological products and products based on recombinant DNA technology. SIFs contain additional safety and identity data to establish proper biocontainment requirements and to conduct confirmatory testing. Other supportive documentation is product-type specific and includes in-process procedures and corresponding validation reports, potency test development report, stability reports, and veterinary biologics production and test for satisfactory three consecutive prelicensing serials (numbered lots) of product.
 ﻿
 Other information. This includes labels or label sketches.
 ﻿
 A unique requirement for veterinary biologics in the United States is that manufacturers must hold a United States Veterinary Biologics Establishment License to produce licensed veterinary biologicals. An establishment license will only be issued if at least one biological product qualifies for a license. Applications for veterinary biologics establishments include articles of incorporation for the applicant, qualifications of veterinary biologics personnel for key employees, water quality statement, facility blueprints, plot plans, and legends.
 ﻿
 Regulatory Process at the USDA
 Applicants are encouraged to contact the CVB early in the product development process. A licensing reviewer will be assigned to help with the regulatory process. Initially, the CVB will confirm that the proposed product meets the definition of a veterinary biologic and is subject to regulation by the CVB. The CVB then recommends that applicants submit a licensing plan, including pivotal study protocols, to the CVB for review and comment prior to initiating work that will be used to support product licensure. The USDA provides a complete list of guidance documents named “Veterinary Services Memorandums” that lay out the data requirements and regulatory process. Applicants that do not hold a United States Veterinary Biologics Establishment License need to submit the required documentation for the establishment and the product concurrently.
 ﻿
 Study protocols and reports can be submitted any time after the initial applications have been made. The administrative process is facilitated by forms (APHIS Forms) that accompany the submissions and capture regulatory actions. There is no requirement to submit parts of dossiers or entire dossiers. The CVB provides official responses to submissions indicating if more data are needed or that the submission was satisfactory to support licensure. When master seed and master cell reports have been found to be satisfactory, samples have to be submitted to the CVB laboratory for confirmatory testing. Once all requirements have been satisfactorily met, the CVB will issue a veterinary biological product license.
 ﻿
 In cases of emergencies, which means there is no approved product available, the USDA will issue a time-limited conditional license after the manufacturing and safety requirements have been substantially fulfilled and a reasonable expectation of efficacy has been established. The applicant has to continue the pivotal efficacy program and product testing validation. The conditional license can be extended if reasonable progress towards full licensure can be demonstrated.
 ﻿
 There are no statutory review times. Submissions enter the review queue in chronological order. Hence predictions of development timelines and time to approval are difficult to make. However, we believe the typical time to achieve conditional licensure is approximately three years and the typical time to achieve full licensure is approximately five years.
 ﻿
 Furthermore, while the CVB regulates certain biologics (for instance, based on the immunological nature of the mode of action) the CVM regulates other biologics in a manner described above under “Regulatory Process at the FDA.”

     Other Regulatory Considerations
 Regulatory rules relating to human food safety, food additives, or drug residues in food will not apply to the products we currently are developing because our products are not intended for use in food production animals.
 ﻿
 Advertising and promotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable agency. We will conduct a review of advertising and promotional material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell pet therapeutics.
 ﻿
 European Regulatory Process
 In general, the requirements for regulatory approval of an animal health product in the EU are similar to those in the United States, requiring demonstrated evidence of purity, safety, efficacy and consistency of manufacturing processes.
 ﻿
 The EMA is responsible for coordinating scientific evaluation of applications for marketing approval via the centralized procedure for pet therapeutics in the EU. To perform these evaluations, the EMA established a specific scientific committee, the CVMP. The CVMP considers applications submitted by companies for the marketing approval of individual pet therapeutics and evaluates whether or not the medicines meet the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements. Assessments conducted by the CVMP are based on scientific criteria and are intended to ensure that pet therapeutics reaching the marketplace have a positive benefit-risk balance in favor of the pet population they are intended for. Based on the CVMP’s recommendation, a centralized marketing authorization is granted by the European Commission, which allows the product to be marketed throughout the EEA. The CVMP is also responsible for various post-authorization and maintenance activities, including the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization.
 ﻿
 There are three different procedures to receive a marketing authorization (regulatory approval) in Europe, the decentralized procedure (“DCP”), the mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”), and the centralized procedure (“CP”). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain products and technologies, for example biopharmaceuticals, gene therapy products, somatic cell therapeutic products or certain therapeutic areas, for example oncology or neurodegenerative disorders. Otherwise the sponsor can opt between CP and DCP.
 ﻿
 An application for CP is submitted to the EMA which coordinates the scientific evaluation. To perform these evaluations, the EMA established a specific scientific committee, the CVMP. The CVMP evaluates whether the medicines meet the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements. Assessments conducted by the CVMP are based on scientific criteria and are intended to ensure that pet therapeutics reaching the marketplace have a positive benefit-risk balance in favor of the pet population they are intended for. Based on the CVMP’s recommendation, a centralized marketing authorization is granted by the European Commission, which allows the product to be marketed in any of the EU states. The CVMP is also responsible for various post-authorization and maintenance activities, including the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. The final opinion of the CVMP is generally given within 210 days of the submission of a dossier.
 ﻿
 For products that are not eligible for centralized approval, the competent authorities of the EU Member States are responsible for granting marketing authorizations for products that are sold in their markets. Such products may be approved nationally in one Member State, or in multiple Member States via the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure.
 ﻿
 A DCP can be used for products that have not been approved in any of the EU member states and do not fall under mandatory CP. The sponsor selects one Reference Member State (“RMS”) and one or more Concerned Member States (“CMS”). The RMS leads the scientific evaluation and with the input from CMS issues the initial and final assessment report. The regulatory assessment period is similar to the CP and divided into two periods of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The procedure ends with a consensus decision and leads to products approval in the RMS and CMS.
 ﻿
 The MRP must be used for products that have been approved in at least one EU member state either by national procedure or DCP. The MRP uses an existing and if needed updated assessment report to extend marketing authorizations to more EU member states.
 ﻿
 In the EU, products for MUMS are eligible for regulatory incentives such as free scientific advice and fee reductions. These incentives may apply, for example, if it can be documented that the population of cats or dogs that contract a specific condition is below a specified number in Europe. However, the EMA recently announced that fee reductions are only applicable to products indicated for food-producing species. An applicant may apply to the EMA for MUMS classification for any product irrespective of the intended route of approval (i.e. centralized, decentralized or national approval) and incentives may be requested for all routes of authorization. The CVMP has established guidelines specific to MUMS for data requirements, which apply to all sections of the application, i.e. quality, safety and efficacy. Consequently, there may be scope for a reduced quality data package. Similarly, the safety and efficacy sections might be abridged to a certain extent (more flexibility for the combination of dose-determination, dose-confirmation and field studies) provided reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness are submitted. However, the CVMP and national veterinary medicines regulators have significant discretion in this respect. Overall, data requirements for demonstrating quality, efficacy and 

 

16

 
     safety in the target species for minor use indications of a new medicine will be determined on a case-by-case basis and any potential applicant should seek scientific advice on specific data requirements to guide its research and development activities.
     Rest of World
 Each other country has its own regulatory requirements for approving and marketing veterinary pharmaceuticals. For example, in countries like Canada, Brazil or Australia, a government agency is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals for animal use. 
 ﻿
 Many country specific regulatory laws contain provisions that include requirements for labeling, safety, efficacy and manufacturers’ quality control procedures to assure the consistency of the products, as well as company records and reports. With the exception of the EU, the regulatory agencies of most other countries generally refer to the FDA, USDA, EMA, and other international animal health entities, including the World Organization for Animal Health and the Codex Alimentarius Commission, in establishing standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines.
