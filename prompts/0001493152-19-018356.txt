ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
 
General Development of the Business
 
In this 10-K, “we”, “us”, “our”, “MREIC” or “the Company”, refers to Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, together with its predecessors and subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
 
We are a corporation that qualifies as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Our investment focus is to own well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. We were founded in 1968 and are one of the oldest public equity REITs in the world. We intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT in the future. As a REIT, with limited exceptions, we will not be taxed under Federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders. For special tax provisions applicable to REITs, refer to Sections 856-860 of the Code. We are subject to franchise taxes in several of the states in which we own properties.
 
In December 2017, as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA), Code Section 199A, was added to the Code and became effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Under the TCJA, subject to certain income limitations, an individual taxpayer and estates and trusts may deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of qualified REIT dividends they receive from their taxable income. Qualified REIT dividends do not include any portion of a dividend received from a REIT that is classified as a capital gain dividend or qualified dividend income.
 
We were established in 1968 as a New Jersey Business Trust (NJBT). In 1990, the NJBT merged into a newly formed Delaware corporation. On May 15, 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Delaware to Maryland by merging with and into a Maryland corporation.
 
Narrative Description of Business
 
Our primary business is the ownership of real estate. Our investment focus is to own well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. At September 30, 2019, we held investments in 114 properties totaling 22.3 million square feet with an overall occupancy rate of 98.9% (See Item 2 for a detailed description of the properties). Subsequent to fiscal yearend 2019, effective November 1, 2019, we leased one of our previously vacant properties consisting of 60,000 square feet for 12.5 years, increasing our current overall occupancy rate to 99.2%. As of the fiscal yearend, our weighted-average lease expiration was 7.6 years, our annualized average base rent per occupied square foot was $6.20 and the weighted average building age, based on the square footage of our buildings, was 9.2 years. These properties are located in 30 states: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. All of these properties are wholly-owned with the exception of the two properties in New Jersey in which we own a majority interest. All of our investment properties are leased on a net basis except for an industrial park in Monaca (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania and our only non-industrial asset, which is a shopping center, located in Somerset, New Jersey.
 
In addition, we opportunistically invest in marketable securities of other REITs. Historically, we have aimed to limit the size of our REIT securities portfolio to no more than approximately 10% of our undepreciated assets, which we define as total assets excluding accumulated depreciation. As we announced earlier this year, it is now our goal to gradually reduce the size of our REIT securities portfolio to no more than 5% of our undepreciated assets.
 
As of September 30, 2019, we had 16 full-time employees and one part-time employee.

During fiscal 2019, we purchased three industrial properties totaling 824,000 square feet with net-leased terms ranging from 10 to 14 years resulting in a weighted average lease maturity of 11.6 years. All three properties are leased to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries, of which, 474,000 square feet, or 58%, is leased to FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., a subsidiary of FedEx Corporation (FDX). The aggregate purchase price for the three properties was $138.6 million. These properties are located in Georgia, Indiana and New Jersey. These three properties are expected to generate annualized rental income over the life of their leases of $8.8 million. In connection with the three properties acquired during the 2019 fiscal year, we entered into three 15 year fully-amortizing mortgage loans. The principal amount of the three mortgage loans originally totaled $89.5 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.21%.
 
During fiscal 2019, we completed a 155,000 square foot building expansion at our property located in Monroe (Cincinnati), OH for a total project cost of $8.6 million. The expansion resulted in a new 15-year lease which extended the prior lease expiration date from February 2030 to February 2034. The expansion also resulted in an increase in initial annual rent effective March 1, 2019 of $821,000 from $980,000, or $4.22 per square foot, to $1.8 million, or $4.65 per square foot. In addition, the annual rent will increase by 2% per annum, resulting in an average annualized rent of $2.1 million over the 15-year term. In connection with this expansion, we obtained a 10.6 year, fully-amortizing second mortgage loan of $7.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 3.85%. The maturity of the second mortgage loan coincides with the maturity of the property’s first fully-amortizing mortgage loan which is at a fixed interest rate of 3.77% and has a principal balance of $6.6 million as of the fiscal yearend.
 
Subsequent to fiscal yearend 2019, on October 10, 2019, we purchased a newly constructed 616,000 square foot industrial building, situated on 78.6 acres, located in the Indianapolis, IN Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The building is 100% net-leased to Amazon.com Services, Inc. for 15 years through August 2034. The lease is guaranteed by Amazon.com, Inc. The purchase price was $81.5 million. We obtained an 18 year, fully-amortizing mortgage loan of $52.5 million at a fixed interest rate of 4.27%. Annual rental revenue over the remaining term of the lease averages $5.0 million.
 
The industrial property purchased thus far during fiscal 2020 increased our current total leasable square feet to 22.9 million.
 
In addition to the $81.5 million property purchased subsequent to our fiscal yearend, as described above, we have entered into agreements to purchase four, new build-to-suit, industrial buildings that are currently being developed in North Carolina, Ohio (2) and Utah, totaling 997,000 square feet. These future acquisitions have net-leased terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with a weighted average lease term of 14.2 years. The total purchase price for these four properties is $150.5 million. Three of these four properties, consisting of 844,000 square feet, or 85%, are leased to FDX or its subsidiaries. All four properties are leased to companies, or subsidiaries of companies, that are considered Investment Grade by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and by Moody’s (www.moodys.com). The references in this report to the S&P Global Ratings’ website and the Moody’s website are not intended to and do not include, or incorporate by reference into this report, the information of S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s on such websites. Subject to satisfactory due diligence and other customary closing conditions and requirements, we anticipate closing three of these transactions during fiscal 2020 and one during early fiscal 2021. In connection with one of these four properties, we have entered into a commitment to obtain a 10 year, fully-amortizing mortgage loan of $9.4 million with a fixed interest rate of 3.47%.
 
We may have additional acquisitions and expansions in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, and the funds for these acquisitions may come from funds generated from operations, mortgages, draws on our unsecured line of credit facility, cash on hand, sale of marketable securities, other bank borrowings, proceeds from the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP), proceeds from the Preferred Stock At-The-Market Sales Agreement Program (Preferred Stock ATM Program), and proceeds from private placements and public offerings of additional common or preferred stock or other securities. To the extent that funds or appropriate properties are not available, fewer acquisitions will be made.
 
On October 1, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.17 per share, to be paid on December 16, 2019, to common shareholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2019, which represents an annualized common dividend rate of $0.68 per share. We intend to pay these distributions from cash flows from operations.

We have maintained or increased our common stock cash dividend for 28 consecutive years. On October 1, 2015, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.16 per share representing a 6.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. Then again, most recently, on October 2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend from $0.16 per share to $0.17 per share, representing a 6.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. These two dividend raises represent a total increase of 13%.
 
Our common stock dividend policy is dependent upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, availability and cost of bank financing and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. It is our intention to continue making comparable quarterly distributions in the future and to grow our distributions over time.
 
Currently, we derive our income primarily from real estate rental operations. Rental and Reimbursement Revenue (excluding Lease Termination Income in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 of $-0-, $210,000, and $-0-, respectively) was $158.5 million, $139.2 million and $116.4 million for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total undepreciated assets (which is our total assets excluding accumulated depreciation) were $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
As of September 30, 2019, we had 22.3 million leasable square feet, of which 10.4 million square feet, or 47%, consisting of 60 separate stand-alone leases, were leased to FDX and its subsidiaries (5% to FDX and 42% to FDX subsidiaries). These properties are located in 25 different states. As of September 30, 2019, the 60 separate stand-alone leases that are leased to FDX and FDX subsidiaries had a weighted average lease maturity of 8.7 years. As of September 30, 2019, the only tenant that leased 5% or more of our total square footage was FDX (including its subsidiaries). None of our properties are subject to a master lease or any cross-collateralization agreements.
 
During fiscal 2019, the only tenant that accounted for 5% or more of our rental and reimbursement revenue was FDX (including its subsidiaries). Our rental and reimbursement revenue from FDX and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, totaled $94.9 million, $80.7 million and $68.2 million, or as a percentage of total rent and reimbursement revenues, 60% (5% from FDX and 55% from FDX subsidiaries), 58% (7% from FDX and 51% from FDX subsidiaries) and 59% (7% from FDX and 52% from FDX subsidiaries).
 
As noted previously, subsequent to fiscal yearend 2019, on October 10, 2019, we purchased a newly constructed 616,000 square foot industrial building, net-leased to Amazon.com Services, Inc. which is guaranteed by Amazon.com, Inc. As a result of this recent purchase, we currently have 22.9 million total leasable square feet, of which 1.4 million square feet, or 6% of our total leasable square feet, consisting of four separate stand-alone leases are leased to Amazon.com Services, Inc. These properties are located in four different states. We estimate that our rental and reimbursement revenue from Amazon.com Services, Inc. will be approximately 7% of our total rent and reimbursement revenues in fiscal 2020.
 
FDX and Amazon.com, Inc. are publicly-owned companies and financial information related to these entities are available at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. Both FDX and Amazon.com, Inc. are considered Investment Grade issuers by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and by Moody’s (www.moodys.com). The references in this report to the SEC’s website, S&P Global Ratings’ website and Moody’s website are not intended to and do not include or incorporate by reference into this report the information of FDX, Amazon.com, Inc., S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s on such websites.
 
Our weighted-average lease expiration was 7.6 years and 8.1 years as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and our average annualized rent per occupied square foot as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $6.20 and $6.01, respectively. Our overall occupancy rate as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 was 98.9% and 99.6%, respectively. Subsequent to the fiscal yearend 2019, effective November 1, 2019, we leased one of our previously vacant properties consisting of 60,000 square feet for 12.5 years, increasing our current overall occupancy rate to 99.2%.

We compete with other investors in real estate for attractive investment opportunities. These investors include other equity real estate investment trusts, limited partnerships, syndications and private investors, among others. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects acquisitions, occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of certain properties. We have built long-term relationships within our tenant base as well as within the merchant builder community. These relationships have historically provided us with investment opportunities that fit our investment policy. The amount of new construction of industrial properties on the national level has been increasing the past seven years following several years of historically low levels of new supply. These levels of new supply, although increasing, continue to be below historical norms. Driven to a large extent by the continued growth in ecommerce sales, demand for industrial space remains very strong, driving national occupancy rates to an all-time high of 95% currently. For further discussion of potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see Item 1A: Risk Factors below.
 
Industrial space demand is very closely correlated to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. Despite ten years of unprecedented monetary stimulus, real annual GDP growth averaged less than 2.0% over this period. Economic growth has been strengthening this past year further increasing demand for industrial space. The most significant demand driver for modern industrial real estate continues to be ecommerce. Every year since the turn of the century, the percentage of goods purchased on-line has increased at an average 16% annual growth rate. Today, excluding food, fuel, and autos, approximately 19% of total retail sales have migrated from traditional store sales to on-line sales and we expect this growth in market share to continue. We expect these favorable trends for the industrial real estate sector to be a leading demand driver for the foreseeable future, as consumers continue to embrace the added efficiencies of on-line consumption. The strong financial position of our tenants, together with the long duration of our leases, provides for high quality, reliable income streams throughout the business cycle.
 
In October 2018, we completed a public offering of 9.2 million shares of our Common Stock (including the underwriters’ option to purchase 1.2 million additional shares) at a price of $15.00 per share, before underwriting discounts. This was our first common stock offering since 2014 and represented an 11.3% increase in our outstanding common shares. We received net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and all other transaction costs, of $132.3 million.
 
On June 29, 2017, we entered into a Preferred Stock At-The-Market Sales Agreement Program with B. Riley FBR, Inc., or B. Riley (formerly FBR Capital Markets & Co.), that provided for the offer and sale of shares of our 6.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, or our 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock, having an aggregate sales price of up to $100.0 million. On August 2, 2018, we replaced this program with a new Preferred Stock At-The-Market Sales Agreement Program (Preferred Stock ATM Program) that provides for the offer and sale from time to time of $125.0 million of our 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock, representing an additional $96.5 million. Sales of shares of our 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock under the Preferred Stock ATM Program are in “at the market offerings” as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including, without limitation, sales made directly on or through the NYSE, or on any other existing trading market for the 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock, or to or through a market maker or any other method permitted by law, including, without limitation, negotiated transactions and block trades. We began selling shares through these programs on July 3, 2017. Since inception through September 30, 2019, we sold 5.5 million shares under these programs at a weighted average price of $24.81 per share, and generated net proceeds, after offering expenses, of $134.0 million, of which 2.4 million shares were sold during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 at a weighted average price of $24.49 per share, and generated net proceeds, after offering expenses, of $58.2 million. As of September 30, 2019, there is $59.8 million remaining that may be sold under the Preferred Stock ATM Program.
 
As of September 30, 2019, 13.9 million shares of the 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.
 
Subsequent to the September 30, 2019, through November 25, 2019, we sold 1.4 million shares of our 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock under our Preferred Stock ATM Program at a weighted average price of $25.00 per share, and realized net proceeds, after offering expenses, of $35.3 million.

Investment and Other Policies
 
Our investment policy is to concentrate our investments in well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. Our strategy is to obtain a favorable yield spread between the income from the net-leased industrial properties and interest costs. In addition, we believe that investments in well-located, modern industrial properties provide a potential for long-term capital appreciation. There is the risk that, upon expiration of leases, the properties will become vacant or will be re-leased at lower rents. The results obtained from re-leasing the properties will depend on the market for industrial properties at that time.
 
In fiscal 2019, approximately 7% of our gross leasable area, representing 11 leases totaling 1.5 million square feet, was set to expire. Seven of these 11 leases have been renewed, representing 1.1 million square feet, or 76% of the expiring square footage and have a weighted average lease term of 7.2 years. These seven lease renewals resulted in a U.S. GAAP straight-line weighted average lease rate of $4.81 per square foot. The renewed weighted average initial cash rent per square foot is $4.67. This compares to the former weighted average rent of $4.75 per square foot on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and the former weighted average cash rent of $4.99 per square foot, resulting in an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 1.3% on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and a decrease in the weighted average lease rate of 6.4% on a cash basis. Three of the four leases that did not renew were re-tenanted. The seven lease renewals, along with the three properties that were re-tenanted, resulted in a weighted average term of 7.6 years and an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 3.7% on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and a decrease in the weighted average lease rate of 5.1% on a cash basis. The property that has not been re-tenanted, represents 105,000 square feet or 0.7% of our total gross leasable area and is currently being marketed.
 
We seek to invest in well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. In management’s opinion, the recently acquired facilities meet these criteria. We have a concentration of properties leased to FDX and FDX subsidiaries. This is a risk that shareholders should consider. FDX is a publicly-owned company and financial information related to this entity is available at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. FDX is rated “BBB” by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and is rated “Baa2” by Moody’s (www.moodys.com), which are both considered “Investment Grade” ratings. The references in this report to the SEC’s website, S&P Global Ratings’ website and Moody’s website are not intended to and do not include or incorporate by reference into this report the information of FDX, S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s on such websites.
 
We may issue securities for property; however, this has not occurred to date. We may repurchase or reacquire our shares from time to time if, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, such acquisition is in our best interest. On January 16, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $40.0 million increase to our previously announced $10.0 million Common Stock Repurchase Program (the “Program”), bringing the total available under the Program to $50.0 million. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchase will be determined by us at our discretion and will be subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. To date, we have not repurchased any common stock pursuant to the Program, and we may elect not to repurchase any common stock in the future. The Program does not have a termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at our discretion without prior notice.
 
Property Management
 
With the exception of three properties, all of our 114 properties are self-managed by us.
 
We paid fees directly to local property management subagents of $468,000, $437,000 and $394,000 for fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Environmental Matters
 
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, an owner of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under such property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. These liabilities may include government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances. Although generally our tenants are primarily responsible for any environmental damages and claims related to the leased premises, in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of a tenant of such premises to satisfy any obligations with respect to such environmental liability, we may be required to satisfy such obligations. In addition, as the owner of such properties, we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims irrespective of the provisions of any lease.
 
From time to time, in connection with managing the properties or upon acquisition of a property, we authorize the preparation of Phase I and, when necessary, Phase II environmental reports with respect to our properties. Based upon such environmental reports and our ongoing review of our properties, as of the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties which we believe would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however, that (1) the discovery of environmental conditions, the existence or severity of which were previously unknown; (2) changes in law; (3) the conduct of tenants; or (4) activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties, will not expose us to material liability in the future.
