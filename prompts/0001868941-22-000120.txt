Overview 
Fluence is a leading global provider of energy storage products and services and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital applications (“Fluence IQ”) for renewables and storage. Our energy storage products are built on our sixth-generation technology stack (“Tech Stack”), which combines our modular, factory-built hardware (“Fluence Cube”) with a proprietary edge-based controls system (“Fluence OS”). Our service offerings include delivery services and recurring operational services, as well as financing structuring services, such as energy-storage-as-a-service (“ESaaS”). The Fluence IQ Digital Platform includes Fluence Mosaic, which delivers AI-powered market bidding optimization for solar, wind, and energy storage assets, including non-Fluence energy storage systems.
As of September 30, 2022, we had 1.8 gigawatts (“GW”) of energy storage assets deployed and 3.7 GW of contracted backlog across 44 markets in 36 countries with a gross global pipeline of 37.7 GW. As of September 30, 2022, our global operational and maintenance (“O&M”) services team was providing services for 2.0 GW of energy storage assets, with a further 2.0 GW of contracted backlog. See the “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operating Metrics” for additional information regarding our deployed assets, contracted backlog and pipeline.
In October 2020, we acquired the software and digital intelligence platform of Advanced Microgrid Solutions (“AMS”), a leading artificial intelligence-enabled optimized bidding software for utility-scale storage and renewable generation assets. In April 2022, the Company entered into a share sale purchase agreement and acquired all outstanding shares, the assets and assumed the liabilities of Nispera AG (“Nispera”), a Zurich based provider of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-enabled software-as-a-service (SaaS) targeting the renewable energy sector. The software we acquired from AMS became Fluence Mosaic. As of September 30, 2022, we had an aggregate of 13.7 GW of renewable energy assets using Fluence Mosaic and 3.6 GW of contracted backlog related to renewable and energy storage assets. We expect our services and Fluence IQ digital applications, including Fluence Mosaic, to expand meaningfully over the next five years and contribute increasingly to our bottom-line growth. 
Our Industry and Market Opportunity
Climate change is an existential threat. Severe weather events and broader awareness of the financial implications of climate change are driving a systemic global transition away from fossil fuels towards sustainable energy systems. However, renewable generation, unlike fossil fuel generation, has no inherent storage capacity and can only be used in favorable wind and solar conditions. Energy storage is therefore a critical enabler of large-scale adoption of 24/7 renewable energy. Furthermore, accelerating electrification of industries such as transportation is driving demand for more generation. Energy storage can help both serve and smooth additional peak demand, improving grid reliability and managing energy requirements. 
As the first truly digital asset on the electric grid, energy storage is also a uniquely flexible tool for grid planners, operators, and power providers. We believe energy storage sits at the epicenter of the global clean energy transition and represents the backbone of a massive change in our energy market infrastructure driven by three key trends: Grid modernization, decarbonization, and digitalization. The energy transformation will require $134 trillion of investment through 2050 based on the midpoint of Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s (“BloombergNEF”) New Energy Outlook (“NEO”) 2021 clean electricity and green hydrogen pathway.
Governments across the globe have announced and implemented various policies, regulation and legislation to support the transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon forms of energy which will act as potential catalysts to our growth in the Americas, Europe and Asia. For Example, In August 2022, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), which includes a number of government incentives that support the adoption of energy storage products and services and are anticipated to benefit the Company and its operations. Refer to the Government Regulation and Compliance section for further discussion.
Energy Storage Market Opportunity
The energy storage market is comprised of three components: 
• Energy storage products — the components (including batteries), professional services, and labor required to manufacture, assemble, and install products. The energy storage products market is driven by the deployment of new energy storage products globally, and its addressable market is comprised of the annual spend associated with the manufacturing, delivery, and installation of new energy storage products. According to BloombergNEF, global annual energy storage capacity installations, excluding the residential market, grew from 0.6 GW a year in 2015 to 16 GW a year in 2022, and are expected to grow to 72 GW a year by 2030. We believe most forecasts for the energy storage sector, including BloombergNEF’s, understate the size and market opportunity as forecasts generally only account for spend associated with the physical energy storage asset and do not account for the associated service and digital spend. 
• Services — recurring operational and maintenance services that energy storage products require, management services that are provided by third parties when asset owners outsource the operations of their systems, and the provision of ESaaS. The services market is driven by the growth in installed energy storage products globally, and its addressable market is comprised of the recurring annual service spend across the entire fleet of energy storage products, which is continuing to grow through new product installations. According to BloombergNEF, global installed energy storage capacity, excluding the residential market, grew 57% per annum between 2015 and 2020, and the installed base is expected to grow at a 31% annual growth rate through 2030. BloombergNEF forecasts that global installed energy storage capacity will reach 193.7 GW by 2030, excluding the residential market. 
• Digital applications and solutions — operating systems, applications, such as trading platforms that allow system owners to manage their grid participation. These trading platforms can be deployed on both energy storage assets and renewable and conventional generation assets. The digital applications and solutions sector is driven by the growth in installed energy storage products and renewable and conventional generation assets, and its addressable market is comprised of the total global installed fleet of energy storage products and renewable and conventional generation assets. The digital applications and solutions economic model 
is primarily structured as (i) $/kilowatt (“kW”) recurring fixed fees, and in some cases (ii) $/kW performance-based incentive fees both calculated based on the GWs of storage and generation assets on which digital applications and solutions service offerings are deployed. We believe there is an opportunity to not only deploy digital applications and solutions on individual assets but also across entire energy storage fleets and portfolios of generation assets to improve their collective performance and economic output, and to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the electric grid by optimizing the interactions between different asset types. 
We believe there are multiple factors driving continued growth in the energy storage sector, including:
• The accelerating transition from fossil to renewable generation is expected to require significant increases in energy storage capacity to both offset potential grid instability caused by intermittent renewable resources and enable the use of power from renewable generation assets at times when the natural resource is unavailable.
• Growing capacity constraints on existing power grids that were not designed to support distributed and renewable generation infrastructure or technologies such as electric vehicles are positioning energy storage assets as a key solution.
• As predicted by IHS Markit, a forecasted reduction in the battery cost by 2024 is expected to improve the economics of energy storage and support the development of larger energy storage systems.
• Environmental responsibility has become a priority for major companies and investors, with over 300 major companies having pledged to source 100% of their energy from renewables as part of the RE100, a global corporate renewable energy initiative.
• Governments across the globe have announced policies to support the transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon forms of energy.
Our Products and Services 
Our offerings include energy storage products and delivery services, recurring operational services and digital solutions and applications for energy storage and other power assets. We may refer to our energy storage products as “Solutions” and use this term interchangeably as it is more reflective of offering provided to our customers. We have repeatedly pioneered new use cases for grid-scale energy storage. Some of the uses we have supported include frequency regulation, generation enhancement, capacity peak power, energy cost control, microgrids/islands, renewable integration, virtual dams, T&D enhancement, and critical power.
Energy Storage Products
We sell highly configurable energy storage products with integrated hardware, software and digital intelligence. We offer four energy storage products built on our sixth-generation Tech Stack foundation, which are optimized for common customer use cases but can be configured for specific use cases: 
•Gridstack™:   grid-scale, industrial-strength energy storage product designed for demanding market applications with industry-leading reliability, scalability, and safety. Its design is built for applications including flexible peaking capacity, frequency regulation, renewable integration, transmission, and distribution enhancement and more. 
•Sunstack™:   designed to optimize solar capture and delivery. Its product architecture unites batteries and PV on the same side of the DC bus to take advantage of higher PV-to-inverter ratios, maximize solar yield, and simplify the interconnection process. 
•Edgestack™:   commercial energy storage product that discharges when needed to flatten a facility’s energy load profile, resulting in significantly reduced demand charges. The fully integrated product is available in smaller-size building blocks that can be easily configured to meet the needs of individual facilities and aggregated across fleets or locations without time-consuming redesigns. 
•Ultrastack™:  the entities that control and operate our electricity system are facing significant reliability challenges as the grid moves away from higher-cost thermal generation assets and increasingly relies on energy from lower-cost but variable renewables and low carbon sources. Fluence has developed a storage solution to serve the unique performance needs of transmission and distribution system owners and operators in this segment, including stringent requirements around availability, uptime, and IT security. The solution will feature redundant controls and metering, fast system response, and advanced controls applications that deliver a suite of highly technical grid services, such as synthetic inertia and power oscillation damping. These applications are designed to reduce grid congestion, support stable system operation, and help operators increase utilization of existing and new transmission assets, which in turn reduces the total cost of electricity to consumers. Advanced controls capabilities for this solution have been in active development and will be fully tested at Fluence’s global product testing facilities prior to production and project deliveries in this segment.
In addition, each of our products comes with our proprietary controls software, Fluence OS, which enables asset owners to operate the storage system directly with pre-set modes and market dispatch applications or integrate directly with external ISO and EMS signals. OS provides real-time information through multiple systems views, alarm notifications, and dashboards. It is an integral part of all our energy storage product sales. Fluence OS enables Fluence energy storage products to deliver critical grid services such as 
primary frequency regulation, secondary frequency response, fast frequency response, peak shaving, voltage regulation, power factor regulation, non-spinning reserves, capacity peak power, solar energy time-shifting, firm solar export, energy arbitrage, and more. Fluence also delivers stacking of grid services, allowing storage assets to perform multiple services simultaneously and increase revenue-generating opportunities.
We also offer comprehensive engineering and delivery services to support the deployment of our storage products. Customers can select from a range of delivery service, from project design to full-wrap turnkey installation. 
We have designed our energy storage products to allow for licensing to third-party partners, and plan to offer the ability to license Fluence products, services, and digital applications to partners targeting specific geographies and market use cases.

Environmental, Social, and Governance    
Overview
We are a purpose-built, purpose-driven company on a mission to transform the way we power our world for a more sustainable future. We support the clean energy transition by enabling greater adoption of renewable energy and decarbonized technologies such as reduced use of thermal generation resources. The Company’s products and services enable more sustainable, reliable, and resilient electric grids in a repeatable, scalable way. 
Fluence’s mission to “Transform the way we power our world” is not just a tagline but at the core of what we do and that includes our Company’s Sustainability Program. In fiscal year 2022, we took a purposeful approach to establishing what 
sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) practices mean to us and to our business. The Company’s first step was to establish a core leadership role responsible for the program development and implementation. We then consolidated our environmental stewardship and responsible sourcing practices within the Company for greater support and progress. We are building our Sustainability Program upon three key pillars: 
•Reporting & Stakeholder Engagement 
•Environmental Stewardship & Compliance 
•Responsible Sourcing & Social Compliance 
Reporting & Stakeholder Engagement 
Fluence believes in holding ourselves accountable to our employees, our customers, our partners, and our shareholders. We emphasize transparency as the foundation of our accountability in our Sustainability Program. However, transparency cannot be achieved in a vacuum and we purposely work to leverage our employees’ passion, leadership and management support, and our supply chain partners to remain in a constant stage of improvement. 
Fluence’s Sustainability Program is governed by two internal committees – our ESG Council and ESG Steering. These are cross functional leadership teams responsible for gathering alignment and support across the organization to advance our ESG initiatives. The ESG Council is made up of leadership representing key internal stakeholders (including individuals with expertise in environment, supply chain, human resources, health and safety, legal, marketing, finance, ethics, and logistics). They are responsible for resource allocation and implementation. The ESG Council reports to our ESG Steering, which is comprised of five executive leaders (our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Supply Chain and Manufacturing Officer, and General Counsel). 
In fiscal year 2022, we committed to publishing our first annual sustainability report in February/March 2023, which we intend to align with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) Fuel Cells & Industrial Batteries standard in addition to those standards promulgated by both the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). We intend that our inaugural sustainability report will include our Scope I & II Green House Gas (“GHG”) baseline, and certain portions of our Scope III emissions as well as other important topics including environmental performance, responsible sourcing, stakeholder engagement, governance, philanthropy, community engagement, financial performance, and safety. 
Environmental Stewardship & Compliance
The Company is demonstrating our commitment to preserving the planet’s natural resources through, among other things, the implementation of industry best practices and procedures to measure and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from facilities, supply chain logistics, and employee travel; measuring our waste output and maximizing systems to divert waste away from landfills; and developing and implementing a product recycling competency. We employ a holistic and stakeholder driven approach by bringing together internal stakeholder teams like total quality management, environmental health and safety, engineering, supply chain management, and others on these measures and the data we collect in these efforts will be used to develop responsive actions by us that will continuously reduce our environmental impact. 
Over the last two years, our acumen for developing environmental management systems and achieving continuous improvement of its environmental performance has been demonstrated by our certification of the ISO 14001 standard at our corporate office in Arlington, Virginia and the testing facility in Erlangen, Germany which requires an organization to implement and demonstrate compliance with an effective environmental management system to identify and control the environmental impact of its activities, products, and services; continually improve environmental performance; and implement a systematic approach to setting environmental objectives and targets. We are now working to expand our ISO 14001 certification with the ultimate goal of certifying all relevant Fluence facilities. 
Responsible Sourcing & Compliance 
Fluence is committed to social accountability. We are committed to ensure supply chain compliance with our core philosophies of human rights & dignity, supply chain risk aversion and conflict minerals risk management. Our responsible sourcing and compliance is based on the principles spelled out in our Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of Conduct sets the social conduct expectations for all persons and entities connected to the Fluence value stream. We implement this with a three phase approach, supplier qualification, supplier evaluation and supplier development processes. 
Some of our core programs developed over the past two years are our Conflict Minerals Due Diligence Program, Supplier GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Emissions Disclosures and a Supplier Social Accountability Auditing program. We are leading our value chain in Social Accountability Standards by being SA8000 certified and expect our business partners to show similar commitments to human 
rights and against slavery and child labor. Feedback from our due diligence and auditing programs allows us to map and score our supply chain partners. As we move forward, the Company intends to maintain the highest expectations for responsible sourcing in our value chain. 
Human Capital Management
We believe our workforce is critical to our success and we strive to create a positive, equitable, and safe work environment. To create a culture of transparency, we maintain a regular cadence of communications from the executive leadership team to employees, including emails, all hands meetings, Q&A sessions, and employee resource groups with executive sponsors. 
As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 967 full-time employees. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. As of September 30, 2022, approximately 85 of our employees in Germany were represented by a works council. We have not experienced any employment-related work stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. 
We believe that our purpose-driven culture has fostered a work environment in which employees feel supported, empowered to develop in their careers, and fulfilled in their work. Initiatives driven by this culture include professional development courses made available to all employees, and a partnership with Inova through which we provide free professional and wellness services to employees. To assess and continually improve employee sentiment, we conduct regular employee surveys soliciting feedback on topics such as work/life balance, working remotely, career development, and mentorship. 
Fluence is internationally certified to ISO 9001, a quality management standard that ensures a commitment to customer satisfaction, purpose-driven leadership, and equitable involvement for all employees. Fluence is also internationally certified to ISO 45001, an occupational health and safety standard which requires certain proactive measures to ensure employee safety and reduce workplace risks. Fluence’s corporate headquarters is certified to SA8000, which demonstrates our commitment to the elimination of unethical and discriminatory labor practices, while affirming workers’ rights, livable wages, and treating all people with dignity. 
Fluence is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion that makes our employees feel safe and engaged. We have conducted trainings for hiring managers on how to avoid bias in the interview process and formed a diversity and inclusion working group to identify and address areas for improvement. Women currently represent 30% of our total workforce and 27% of our key corporate management roles as of September 30, 2022. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022 we opened a new technology center in India, becoming Fluence’s first technology center based in Asia. The Fluence India Technology Centre complements existing technology center teams in North America and Europe. Together, the company’s technology teams support Fluence’s regionally focused operational model and create a strong foundation for new product introductions and regionalized product support.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing strategy is designed to meet our key objectives: limit capital-intensive and low value-added activities that can be outsourced to other companies; maintain a capital light business model; minimize labor content where possible; minimize the amount of assembly our customers are required to do at the site; and minimize material movement both from vendors to us and within factories. 
Mass manufacturing is a cornerstone of our product delivery approach and a key to driving down product cost and delivering at scale. We aim to create an optimized production organization, develop mass manufacturing capabilities globally through contract manufacturing, and continue to secure partnerships with key battery suppliers. We believe that enhancing our product-focused model and supply chain leverage will support our global growth objectives and result in superior unit economics. 
We have entered outsourcing contracts for the assembly and production of our Fluence Cube, which ship directly from our contract manufacturers to job sites or designated warehouses. By using regional contract manufacturers, we can drop ship products directly to our customers’ sites, which improves working capital turnover, quality, and inventory management. 
In September of 2022 we partnered with a contract manufacturer to open a new manufacturing facility in the United States to better serve regional delivery and address ongoing supply chain constraints. The facility is located in Utah and will serve the company’s customers in North America. The addition of this contract manufacturing facility expands our production beyond Asia to meet increasing global demand and allow Fluence to better serve regional markets. We intend to expand manufacturing to sites in Europe. 
Fluence also created two spare parts hubs in Europe and the United States to support ongoing operations and maintenance of its customers’ storage assets. These hubs, located in Utah and Ireland, both became operational in fiscal year 2022, and are strategically positioned near large storage markets and customer fleets.
We have developed a global supply chain with an evolving regionally focused operational model with the objective of allowing us to assemble products in proximity to major markets to minimize material movement, working capital investment, and costs of goods sold. Additionally, we believe that the volume of key components we purchase, such as lithium-ion batteries, should provide us leverage to create a competitive advantage on availability, terms and/or pricing from our suppliers. We have a technology co-development and supply agreement with Northvolt that should expand our battery supply chain into Europe. Pursuant to this agreement, we have a license to develop, manufacture and commercialize an optimized battery subsystem that is significantly more energy dense than today’s standard solutions. The agreement also enables us to deploy a battery management system that can be integrated with other vendors to extend our value chain, develop battery competencies, and lower total cost of ownership. 
Intellectual Property
The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies, information, processes and know-how. We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and procedures, and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology. Fluence also has a perpetual license (terminable in the event of an uncured material breach) to certain patents and other intellectual property that belong to AES and Siemens, including methods for cooling inverters, overvoltage protections, and transfer of large amounts of data (methodology). 
We rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary know-how and software that is not patented and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce. We believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs, algorithms, and procedures. 
We require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans. 
Seasonality
We have historically experienced seasonality and see increased order intake in our third and fourth fiscal quarters, driven by demand in the Northern Hemisphere to install energy storage products before the summer of the following year. Combined third and fourth fiscal quarter order intake has historically accounted for 80% or more of our total intake each year. However, as we and the market matures we are experiencing less seasonality. For fiscal year 2022 third and fourth quarter order intake accounted for only 48% of our total intake for the year.
As a result, revenue recognition is typically stronger in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Cash flows historically have been negative in our first and second fiscal quarters, neutral to positive in our third fiscal quarter, and positive in our fourth fiscal quarter. Our services and digital application offerings do not experience the same seasonality given their recurring nature. 
Competition
Our products, services, and digital applications are highly specialized and specific to the clean energy industry. The unique expertise required to design these offerings as well as customers’ reluctance to try unproven products has confined the number of firms that produce such products to a relatively small number, particularly in the segments we are targeting. In addition, we are continuously engaging in developing new use cases and opening new market segments, which are often less contested. 
Our principal competitors include Tesla, Wartsila, and Powin but competition varies by geography, grid service or customer segment. A key differentiator is our ability to identify customer needs and deliver customer-centric products, services, and use cases that can compete in the market either as packages or standalone offerings. We believe we compete favorably based on performance and value-creation, including low total cost of ownership, long-term reliability, varied service options, and convenient and efficient sales and delivery processes.
Government Regulation and Compliance
Greenhouse Gas Emission Related Policies, Regulations and Legislation
Governments across the globe have announced and implemented various policies, regulation and legislation to support the transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon forms of energy. The operation of our business and our customers’ use of our products and services are impacted by these various government actions. For example, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement effective February 19, 2021, an international climate change agreement among almost 200 nations and the European Union, that established a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and which calls for countries to set their own greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve these targets. In August 2022, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), which consists of a number of provisions aimed directly at confronting the climate change crisis. The climate-related provisions of the IRA are projected 
to cut emissions by 40% from 2005 GHG levels in the United States by 2030. Among other things, the IRA introduced an investment tax credit (ITC) for standalone energy storage for the first time, which is anticipated to lower capital cost of equipment. The IRA also contains provisions with incentives for domestic battery manufacturing as well as upstream supply chains. Additional information regarding the tax incentives contained in the IRA are set forth below in “----Government Incentives.” 
Internationally, in June 2021, the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals (the “Fit for 55 package”) as part of the European Green Deal, which encompasses a number of wide-scale proposals aimed at reducing European GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 and targeting net-zero emissions by 2050. Moreover, the European Commission proposed the REPowerEU Plan in May 2022, which is centered around the goal of making Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030, in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine early in 2022. It is meant to incentivize and accelerate the transition to clean energy alternatives and aims to increase the security of energy supply by building and connecting more renewable generation to the grid. 
In September 2022, Australia passed climate change legislation containing a targeted 43% reduction in the emissions intensity of its economy of 2005 GHG levels by 2030 and a reduction to net-zero emissions by 2050. In August 2022, India revised its previous pledge to achieve a 33 – 35% reduction in emissions intensity by 2030 and has committed to reduce emissions intensity by 45% of 2005 GHG levels by 2030 and to achieve about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. In April 2021, the Philippines committed to a projected GHG emissions reduction and avoidance of 75%, of which 2.71% is unconditional, for the period 2020 to 2030 for the sectors of agriculture, wastes, industry, transport, and energy. 
Current and future legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could make lower GHG-emitting energy sources, such as solar and wind, more desirable than higher GHG-emitting energy sources, such as coal and natural gas. As a result, such climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions would potentially increase the demand for energy storage products and related services. 
Policy Initiatives including Tax Incentives, Cash Grants and Performance Incentives 
There are varying policy initiatives across the United States and abroad designed to support and accelerate adoption of clean and/or reliable distributed generation technologies. These policy initiatives can come in the form of tax incentives, cash grants, performance incentives, and/or electric tariffs. 
In the United States, our energy storage products are currently installed or in delivery in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and West Virginia, and each state has its own enabling policy framework, which is subject to change. Some states have utility procurement programs, energy storage mandates, targets or goals, and/or renewable portfolio standards for which our technology is eligible. Many states, including California, Massachusetts, and New York, offer tax exemptions or other customer incentives. 
Although we generally are not regulated as a utility, federal, state, and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence the market for our product and services. These statutes and regulations often relate to electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, competition with utilities and the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. In the United States, governments continuously modify these statutes and regulations. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different rates for commercial (and residential) customers on a regular basis. These changes can have a positive or negative impact on our ability to deliver cost savings to customers for the purchase of electricity. 
As noted, several states have an energy storage mandate or policies designed to encourage the adoption of storage, including nine states with specific energy storage targets as of early 2022. For example, Virginia has a mandate for 3.1 GW of energy storage by 2035, California offers a cash rebate for storage installations through the Self Generation Incentive Program, and Massachusetts and New York offer performance-based financial incentives for storage. Other states, including Illinois and Vermont, are studying energy storage deployment policies and there may be further energy storage mandates coming. Storage installations also are supported in certain states by state public utility commission policies that require utilities to consider alternatives such as storage in integrated resource planning proceedings before they can build new generation. Our customers benefit directly under these programs. 
FERC Support of Energy Storage 
In addition, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has taken a number of steps to help to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. For example, in February 2018, FERC issued Order 841 directing regional transmission operators and independent system operators to remove barriers to the participation of storage in wholesale electricity markets and to establish rules to help ensure storage resources are compensated for the services they provide. Order 841 was upheld in July 2020 following an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, with the court finding that FERC’s directives to allow distributed storage participation in wholesale electricity markets did not violate the Federal Power Act’s jurisdictional line separating FERC’s authority over those markets and states’ authority over local distribution facilities. In September 2020, the FERC issued Order 2222 opening U.S. wholesale energy markets to aggregations of distributed energy resources like rooftop solar, “behind the meter” batteries, and electric vehicles. Additionally, FERC is currently taking public comment on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking to improve interconnection procedures with proposed design elements such as including grid-enhancing technologies like energy storage in interconnection studies and applications.
Energy storage products require interconnection agreements from the applicable authorities having jurisdiction to operate. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection agreements. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are typically required once interconnection agreements are signed. 
Changes in or adoption of federal, state and local policies and policy initiatives, legislation and regulations as well as changes in or adoption of policies and policy initiatives, regulations and legislation in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may pose risks or provide opportunities for the Company’s business that may impact our future operations and financial condition. For more information about the potential risks of adoption or changes to such policies, legislation and regulations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
Permits and Approvals
Each of our installations or customer installations must be designed, constructed, and operated in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations, codes, standards, guidelines, policies, and laws. To install and operate energy storage products on our platform, we, our customers, or our partners, as applicable, are required to obtain applicable permits and approvals from local authorities having jurisdiction to install energy storage products and to interconnect the products with the local electrical utility. 
Government Incentives
The U.S. Congress is continuously reviewing various climate change proposals, incentives and legislation that may support the energy storage industry, including in the form of tax credits. IRS private letter ruling 201809003 clarified that energy storage is eligible for federal tax credits if charged primarily by qualifying renewable resources. In December 2020, the U.S. Congress passed a spending bill that includes $35 billion in energy research and development programs, a two-year extension of the ITC for solar power, a one-year extension of the Production Tax Credit for wind power projects, and an extension through 2025 for offshore wind tax credits. In June 2021, the White House announced that it was looking into dramatically expanding U.S. production of lithium batteries, rare earth minerals, and semiconductors, and seek to stimulate demand for domestically manufactured batteries by expanding federal energy storage procurement, expanding the ITC to include stationary energy storage as a standalone resource, and instituting power transmission regulatory reform to support renewable power and stationary energy storage. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, which was signed into law in November 2021, allocated nearly $7 billion to strengthen the U.S. battery supply chain, which includes producing and recycling critical minerals without new extraction or mining and sourcing materials for domestic manufacturing. Pursuant to this, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued notices of intent in February 2022 to provide $2.91 billion to boost production of the advanced batteries that are critical to the clean energy industry, including energy storage. This funding will support the creation of new domestic manufacturing facilities for batteries and cell components and to support research and development for recycling, reclaiming and adding materials back into the battery supply chain. 
The IRA adopted in August 2022, contains a number of tax incentive provisions that would directly support the adoption of energy storage products and services including: (i) the current ITC is extended for ten years for projects that “begin construction” before 2025, including standalone energy storage for the first time for those projects with a capacity of at least 5 kwh and (ii) will extend the ITC for up to 30% of the cost of installed equipment for ten years and will step down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 (noting that for projects beginning construction after 2019 that are placed in service before January 1, 2022, the ITC would be set at 26%. Beginning in 2025, the existing energy ITC will be replaced by a Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (CEITC) or “tech neutral” regime, which is available for any investment in a qualified storage facility that is placed in service after calendar year 2024 (prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements will still apply). Finally, the IRA creates the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (AMPC), which applies to clean energy technology components produced in the US and sold after calendar year 2022, including battery cells and battery modules, which will begin to phase out in 2030. The above tax credits allow certain tax-exempt entities to receive direct payment from the federal government instead of a reduction of their tax liability. In addition, beginning in January 1, 2023, taxpayers can elect to transfer their ITC or CEITC to an unrelated taxpayer on a facility-by-facility basis for each year in which credit is available. We believe we are well positioned to capture incentives contained in the IRA with our forthcoming battery module manufacturing, as we opened contract manufacturing facility in Utah, our second facility globally, to better serve regional delivery and address ongoing supply chain constraints. However, as  this legislation was recently adopted in August 2022, 
and forthcoming interagency guidance processes are in early stages, we have not yet seen the impact these IRA related incentives may have on our business and operations as we go forward and cannot guarantee we will realize anticipated benefits of incentives under the IRA.
