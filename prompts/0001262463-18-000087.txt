OPERATING LOSSES
 
The Company has incurred net losses from operations of $15,993,000 and $7,361,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Such operating losses reflect developmental and other administrative costs for 2017 and 2016. The Company expects to incur losses in the near future until profitability is achieved.

On December 17, 2015, we entered into an exclusive publishing agreement with Spectacle Games for Pocket Starships for a term of five years, expiring on December 17, 2020. Spectacle Games is a California corporation, holding the exclusive rights to publish and market Pocket Starships, including the ability to sublicense these rights to other parties, pursuant to an agreement with MMOJoe UG. MMOJoe UG, a German limited liability company (“MMOJoe”) is the owner and developer of all intellectual property that relates or pertains to Pocket Starships. The exclusive publishing agreement provides for the Company to fund advanced development and marketing of Pocket Starships in exchange for 50% of the revenue generated by Pocket Starships, plus a recoupment, out of Spectacle’s share of the revenue, of the development money advanced by the Company. Should the Company decide to exercise the Option, the Company will receive 100% of the revenue generated by Pocket Starships.
 
In June 2016, we obtained an exclusive option to purchase all of MMOJoe’s assets including but not limited to all assets pertaining to Pocket Starships (the “Option”) in consideration for 3,750,000 cash based options, exercisable as follows: (a) 500,000 shares at $1.00 per share, expiring on December 31, 2017; (b) 750,000 shares at $2.50 per share, expiring on December 31, 2018; and (c) 2,500,000 shares at $5.00 per share, expiring on December 31, 2019. Under the Option, had the Company decided to exercise the Option, it would have purchased MMOJoe for cash of $5,000,000 plus $10,000,000 worth of shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at the time of closing of the purchase. The exclusive Option was exercisable by us at any time, in our sole discretion, through December 31, 2020.

On October 23, 2017, we restructured and exercised the Option by entering into a definitive agreement with the game's owner pursuant to which SPYR will own all of the game related assets of Pocket Starships, in a cashless transaction, and the publishing agreement with Spectacle as well as the original terms of the Option will be terminated, which means that SPYR will now be able to retain 100% of the revenue generated from the game and will be the sole owner of all of the assets related to the game. The acquisition includes, among other assets, all Pocket Starships related intellectual property, the userbase, artwork, software, internet domains, game store accounts (such as App Store, Play Store, Amazon, and Facebook Gameroom), web portal accounts (Facebook, VK.com, Kongregate, etc.) and internet domains (www.pocketstarships.com). Under the terms of the agreement, the game's owner will receive 8,000,000 restricted shares of SPYR stock (subject to resale gating provisions) and 8,000,000 three-year cash-based options exercisable at $0.50 per share.
 
During 2017, we signed an agreement with CBS Consumer Products that will allow the incorporation of intellectual property (IP) from various Star Trek television series into future Pocket Starships updates and expansions. Our Pocket Starships development team is already working on expansions of Pocket Starships to include the Star Trek IP, which we expect will be released toward the end of the 2nd quarter 2018. In Pocket Starships, players can build and pilot several ships and forge alliances on their quest for galactic domination. Players can perform or initiate various activities ranging from fighting pirates to participating in Faction Alerts. With the release of the expansion those playing Pocket Starships will be able to explore new sectors and engage in exciting battles with the Borg, and will be able to staff their ships with their favorite Star Trek characters from the Star Trek TV series franchise – including The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager, through a trading card expansion.
 
During July 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Reset Studios, LLC for the development of at least two new idle tapper games to be published by SPYR, the first of which will feature characters and storylines from a popular television series of a major television network, the name of which will be released as soon as it is contractually permitted. The Company has secured the necessary license to use the IP in the game through a license agreement with the network. The game will allow players to play as a team of their favorite characters to battle increasingly difficult enemies in order to unlock new characters and rewards. By performing simple actions such as tapping the screen, players can progress in the game even when they’re not actively playing. This new tapper game is currently in the soft launch stage of development and is scheduled to be released during second quarter 2018.
 
The Company intends to utilize cash on hand, shareholder loans and other forms of financing such as the sale of additional equity and debt securities, capital leases and other credit facilities to conduct its ongoing business, and to also conduct strategic business development, marketing analysis, due diligence investigations into possible acquisitions, and software development costs and implementation of our business plans generally. The Company may also decide to diversify, through acquisition or otherwise, in other unrelated business areas if opportunities present themselves.
