ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Introduction
 
We are a designer, producer, and marketer of performance-driven, high-quality ammunition and ammunition component products for sale to a variety of consumers, including sport and recreational shooters, hunters, individuals seeking home or personal protection, manufacturers and law enforcement and military agencies. We also own an online auction site supporting the lawful sale of firearms, ammunition and hunting/shooting accessories. To enhance the strength of our brands and drive product demand, we emphasize product innovation and technology to improve the performance, quality, and affordability of our products while providing support to our distribution channel and consumers. We seek to sell products at competitive prices that compete with high-end, custom, hand-loaded ammunition at competitive prices. Additionally, through our ammunition casing manufacturing and sales operations. We sell ammunition casings products of various types. We emphasize an American heritage by using predominantly American-made components and raw materials in our products that are produced, inspected, and packaged at our facilities in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.
 
Our production processes focus on safety, consistency, precision, and cleanliness. Each round is developed for a specific purpose with a focus on a proper mix of consistency, velocity, accuracy, and recoil. Each round is chamber gauged and inspected with redundant seven-step quality control processes.
 
GunBroker.com is our online auction site. In its role as the auction site, GunBroker.com serves as the listing service and provides for the exchange of information in a secure manner supporting the third-party listing, sale and lawful purchase of firearms, ammunition and accessories connecting over 7.3 million registered users.

Emphasis on Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty
 
We plan to continue to emphasize customer satisfaction and loyalty by offering innovative, distinctive, high-quality products on a timely and cost- attractive basis and by offering effective customer service, training, and support. We regard the features, quality, and performance of our products as the most important components of our customer satisfaction and loyalty efforts, but we also rely on customer service and support.
Continuously Improving Operations
 
We plan to continue focusing on improving all aspects of our business, including research and development, component sourcing, production processes, marketing programs, and customer support. We are continuing our efforts to enhance our production by increasing daily production quantities through equipment acquisitions, expanded shifts and process improvements, increased operational availability of our equipment, reduced equipment down times, and increased overall efficiency. Further, the Company is scheduled to open its new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Manitowoc, WI in the Summer of 2022. The opening and full operation of this new plant will permit the deployment of equipment that has been acquired over the past year and more efficient leverage operation of the factory all designed to exponentially increase capacity through the end of calendar 2022 and into 2023. We have also integrated the GunBroker.com operations into the Company and are focused at this time on deploying new content and coding to enhance the buying and selling visitor experience. We are also working to best leverage the GunBroker.com marketplace through the direct or affiliated marketing and sale of merchandise.
Enhance Market Share, Brand Recognition, and Customer Loyalty
 
We strive to enhance our market share, brand recognition, and customer loyalty. Industry sources estimate that 70 to 80 million people in the United States own more than approximately 393 million firearms creating a large installed base for our ammunition products. We are focusing on the premium segment of the market through the quality, distinctiveness, and performance of our products; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising efforts; and the attractiveness of our competitive pricing strategies. Our work to enhance and simplify the user experience on the GunBroker.com marketplace platform, while adding to its merchandise and related offerings, is designed to enhance the GunBroker.com brand by ensuring customer (both buyers and sellers) adhesion is amplified as they access one of the largest single on-line destinations for interested “2nd Amendment” buyers and sellers within the US market.
Pursue Synergetic Strategic Acquisitions and Relationships
 
We intend to pursue strategic acquisitions and develop strategic relationships designed to enable us to expand our technology and knowhow, expand our product offerings, strengthen and expand our supply chain, enhance our production process, expand our marketing and distribution, and attract new customers.
Products
 
We design, produce, and sell ammunition and ammunition components in a variety of types, sizes, and calibers for use in handguns and long guns. We ship our ammunition in the form of cartridges (or rounds), and also ammunition casings. A cartridge consists of four components: a case made of brass, steel, or copper that holds together all the other components of the cartridge; the primer, which is an explosive chemical compound that ignites the gunpowder when struck by the firing pin; the gun powder, which is a chemical mixture that burns rapidly and creates an expanding gas when ignited and pushes the bullet out the barrel; and the bullet, or projectile, usually containing lead that is fired through the barrel to strike the target. Some of the bullets we produce for certain applications have a jacket, or outer shell, of brass or copper to improve performance and accuracy. We typically produce centerfire cartridges in which the primer is in the bottom, or center of the cartridge, rather than rimfire cartridges in which the primer is in the rim of the cartridge. We also offer ammunition casings for pistol ammunition through large rifle ammunition.
STREAK Visual Ammunition
 
STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™ enables shooters to see the path of the bullets fired by them. STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™ rounds utilize non-flammable phosphor material that produces a glow by the utilization of the light emitted during the round discharge to make STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™ glow. The luminescent material is applied only to the aft end of the projectile, making it visible only to the shooter and those within a 30-degree viewing window. As a result, the glow of STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™ is not visible to the target unlike conventional tracers, which we believe is important to the military and law enforcement. We refer to the technology used by our STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™ as one-way luminescent or O.W.L. Technology™. Unlike conventional tracer ammunition, STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™ rounds are not incendiary and do not utilize burning metals to generate light, thereby eliminating heat generation and making them safer for use in various environments and avoiding serious fire hazards. STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™ comes in 380 auto, 9 mm, 40 S&W, 44 magnum, 45 long colt, and 38 special among other calibers.

We hold the exclusive worldwide sales and distribution rights for the patented O.W.L. Technology™ used by our STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™ and pay a royalty based on our product sales incorporating this technology. On October 13, 2020, the Company further expanded its patent portfolio as a result of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)’s issuance of Patent No. 10,801,821 recognizing the Company’s development of both a protectable and cutting-edge process to mass-produce luminescent projectiles, as well as the luminescent projectiles manufactured as a result of the protected process.
 
Stelth Subsonic Ammunition
 
Stelth Subsonic ammunition is designed specifically for superior performance in suppressed firearms. Stelth ammunition finds applications in which silence is paramount, such as in tactical training, predator night hunts, and clandestine operations. The Stelth ammunition is produced to be a clean burning total metal jacket round to slow baffle corrosion and reduce lead emissions that collect in the suppressor body. Stelth pistol ammunition comes in 9mm, 40 S&W, and 45 AC3. It is also available in a 223 rifle round.
Jesse James Ammunition
 
Jesse James ammunition is jacketed hollow point projectiles designed for self-defense. The load specific development is designed to ensure accuracy, velocity, and consistency and a low recoil. Jesse James ammunition comes in 9mm, 40 S&W, 10mm, 357, 45 auto calibers.
 
AP and HAPI Ammunition
 
Our innovative line of match grade armor piercing (“AP”) and hard armor piercing incendiary (“HAPI”) tactical rounds are the centerpiece of the Company’s strategy to address the unique needs of the armed forces community. This ammunition was designed around a match grade portfolio of projectiles, that include a solid copper boat tail and armor piercing configuration. The distinction between these rounds and other sold, is that the manufacturing process was engineered to ensure extremely tight tolerances between each projectile manufactured, ensuring for the end user that the ballistic trajectory remains consistent between rounds without regard to the actual configuration or round fired. Our AP and HAPI line is also available with our O.W.L. Technology™. The Company has aligned its manufacturing operations to support the large caliber demand from military personnel, such as the 12.7 mm and .50 caliber BMG configurations. On February 2, 2021, we announced that we restarted our improved .50 caliber manufacturing line to address increased market demand and fulfill current orders.

JMC
 
Through Jagemann Munitions Components (“JMC”), we offer ammunition casings for pistol ammunition through large rifle ammunition. Jagemann Munitions Components is backed by decades of manufacturing experience that allows the production of high-quality pistol brass and rifle brass components. Borne from the automotive industry and refined over time to deliver durable and consistent sporting components, Jagemann Munitions Components has become one of the largest brass manufacturers in the country, with the capacity to produce more than 750 million pieces of brass each year with the ability to scale to over 1 billion pieces of brass each year. Proud of its American-made components and capabilities, the Company now has complete control over the manufacturing process. This results in a number of advantages when it comes to the brass that leaves our state-of-the-art facility.

Suppliers
 
We purchase certain of the raw materials and components for our ammunition products, including brass, steel, or copper casings; ammunition primers to ignite gun powder; gun powder; and projectiles. We believe we have reliable sources of supply for all our raw material and component needs, but from time to time raw materials and components are subject to shortages and price increases. Most of our suppliers are U.S.-based and provide us the materials and components at competitive rates. Our ownership of JMC supplies our ammunition casings. We plan to continue to broaden our supplier base and secure multiple sources for all the raw materials and components we require.
Customers
 
We sell our products through “Big Box” retailers, manufacturers, local ammunition stores, and shooting range operators. We also sell direct to customers online. Our consumers include sport and recreational shooters, hunters, competitive shooters, individuals desiring home and personal protection, manufacturers, and law enforcement and military agencies, and selected international markets. We distribute our products under four primary product lines: AMMO Inc. Signature, STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™, Stelth, Jesse James and JMC. One customer accounted for approximately 9.8% of our sales for the year ended March 31, 2022 in comparison to year ended March 31, 2021 in which one customers accounted for approximately 16.5% of our sales.
Competition
 
The ammunition and ammunition casing industry is dominated by a small number of companies, a number of which are divisions of large public companies. We compete primarily on the quality, reliability, features, performance, brand awareness, and price of our products. Our primary competitors include Federal Premium Ammunition, Remington Arms, the Winchester Ammunition division of Olin Corporation, and various smaller manufacturers and suppliers, including Black-Hills Ammunition, CBC Group, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady Manufacturing Company, PMC, Rio Ammunition, and Wolf.
Employees
 
As of June 24, 2022, we had a total of 359 employees. Of these employees, 276 were engaged in manufacturing, 33 in sales, marketing and customer service, 20 in research and development, manufacturing engineering, and software engineering, and 30 in various corporate and administrative functions (information technology, accounting, executives, etc.). None of our employees are represented by a union in collective bargaining with us. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Seasonality
 
Our business has not exhibited a material degree of seasonality to date. Our net sales could be moderately higher in our second and third fiscal quarters because of the fall hunting and holiday seasons.
Intellectual Property
 
We believe our tradenames, trademarks, and service markets are important factors in distinguishing our products. In addition, we regard our trade secrets, technological resources, knowhow, licensing arrangements, and endorsements as important competitive factors.
 
Under the terms of the 2017 merger between our wholly-owned subsidiary, AMMO Technologies Inc., an Arizona corporation (“ATI”) and Hallam, Inc. (“Hallam”), ATI succeeded to all of the assets of Hallam and assumed the liabilities of Hallam, which were none. The primary asset of Hallam was an exclusive license to produce projectiles and ammunition using the Hybrid Luminescence Ammunition Technology under patent U.S. 8,402,896 B1 with a publication date of March 26, 2013 owned by University of Louisiana at Lafayette (“ULL”). The license was formally amended and assigned to ATI pursuant to an Assignment and First Amendment to Exclusive License Agreement Assumption Agreement. Under the terms of the merger with Hallam, we, the sole shareholder of ATI, issued to Hallam’s two shareholders, 600,000 shares of our Common Stock, subject to restrictions, and payment of $200,000. The first payment of $100,000 to the Hallam’s shareholders was paid on September 13, 2017, and the second payment of $100,000 was paid on February 6, 2018.

We hold the exclusive worldwide sales and distribution rights for the patented O.W.L. Technology™ used by our STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™ via our license agreement with ULL. We pay ULL a royalty based on our product sales incorporating this patented technology. We have been using our O.W.L. Technology™ to compete for military contracts in part because we believe the glow of STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™ not being visible to the target (which is unlike conventional tracers) is important to the military and law enforcement.
 
Such military use is allowed pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement between ATI and ULL which was dated as of November 16, 2017 and effective as of January 1, 2018 (the “A&R License Agreement”). The A&R License Agreement expires on January 1, 2022 and is renewable in the Company’s sole discretion for successive four (4) year periods provided the Company is not in breach of the A&R License Agreement. While the parties have agreed that, effective January 1, 2022, the A&R License Agreement was extended to January 1, 2026, the parties are still finalizing the documentation of this extension via the signing of an amendment. The parties expect to complete the amendment to the A&R License Agreement prior to July 15, 2022.
 
We are a party to a license agreement with Jesse James, a well-known motorcycle designer, and Jesse James Firearms, LLC, a Texas limited liability company.

Environmental Matters
 
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing the discharge, treatment, storage, transportation, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes; the restoration of damages to the environment; and health and safety matters. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. We incur expenses in complying with environmental requirements and could incur higher costs in the future as a result of more stringent requirements that may be enacted in the future.
 
Some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal Superfund law and similar state laws, can impose liability, without regard to fault, for the entire cost of the cleanup of contaminated sites on current or former site owners and operators or parties who sent wastes to such sites. Based on currently available information, we do not believe that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
The manufacture, sale, and purchase of ammunition are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign governmental laws. We are also subject to the rules and regulations of the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”) and various state and international agencies that control the manufacture, export, import, distribution and sale of firearms, explosives, and ammunition. Such regulations may adversely affect demand for our products by imposing limitations that increase the costs or limit the availability of our products.
 
Our failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations may result in the limitation of our growth or business activities and could result in the revocation of licenses necessary for our business. Applicable laws and regulations provide for the following:
 

● | require the licensing of all persons manufacturing, exporting, importing, or selling ammunition as a business; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | require serialization, labeling, and tracking of the acquisition and disposition of certain types of ammunition; 
● | regulate the interstate sale of certain ammunition; 
● | restrict or prohibit the ownership, use, or sale of specified categories of ammunition; 
● | require registries of so-called “ballistic images” of ammunition fired from new guns; 
● | govern the sale, export, and distribution of ammunition; 
● | regulate the use and storage of gun powder or other energetic materials; 
● | regulate the employment of personnel with certain criminal convictions; 
● | restrict access to ammunition manufacturing facilities for certain individuals from other countries or with criminal convictions; and 
● | require compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

The handling of our technical data and the international sale of our products may also be regulated by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. These agencies can impose civil and criminal penalties, including denying us from exporting our products, for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 
In addition, bills have been introduced in Congress to establish, and to consider the feasibility of establishing a nationwide database recording so-called “ballistic images” of ammunition fired from new guns. Should such a mandatory database be established, the cost to us, our distributors, and our customers could be significant, depending on the type of firearms and ballistic information included in the database. Bills have been introduced in Congress in the past several years that would affect the manufacture and sale of ammunition, including bills to regulate the manufacture, importation, and sale.
 
We believe that existing federal, state, and local legislation relating to the regulation of firearms and ammunition have not had a material adverse effect on our sales of these products. However, the regulation of firearms and ammunition may become more restrictive in the future, and any such developments might have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, regulatory proposals, even if never enacted, may affect firearms or ammunition sales as a result of consumer perceptions.
 
Transactions taking place on the GunBroker.com site involving the lawful sale of firearms are facilitated from a listing and documentation standpoint by GunBroker.com. The transaction is consummated between a third-party buyer and seller and requires the direct involvement of an ATF Federal Firearms License (“FFL”) holder such as a gun shop or range that accepts receipt of the firearms and completes the transaction and delivery subject to confirmation of compliance with applicable federal and/or state laws.

Our History
 
We were formed under the name Retrospettiva, Inc. in November 1990 to manufacture and import textile products, including both finished garments and fabrics, but ceased operations in 2001. We were inactive from 2001 until December 2016. On December 15, 2016, our then principal stockholders sold their outstanding Common Stock to Fred W. Wagenhals, who is currently Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. On the same date, Mr. Wagenhals became the sole officer and director of our company. As of December 30, 2016, we changed our trading symbol to POWW; we merged into a Delaware corporation, thereby changing our state of incorporation from California to Delaware; we engaged in a 1-for-25 reverse stock split; and we commenced our current business as AMMO, Inc.
 
Our Chairman and Chief Executive Office, Fred Wagenhals, had organized another company on October 13, 2016, which immediately began to take steps to commence the ammunition business. We combined with that company in March 2017, resulting in our acquisition of all the shares of its common stock for 17,285,800 shares of Common Stock and our succession to its business.
 
We entered into licensing an endorsement agreement with Jesse James, a well-known motorcycle and gun designer, in October 2016; received a federal firearms license from ATF in February 2017; purchased an ammunition manufacturing facility in Payson, Arizona in March 2017; and built a management team and otherwise prepared ourself to participate in the ammunition industry.
