Item 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview
 
We are a biotechnology company engaged in the aquaculture, research and development, manufacture and commercialization of KLH. KLH is an immune-stimulating protein with an extensive history of safe and effective use in immunological applications.
 
Immunotherapies (also known as therapeutic vaccines) are an emerging class of treatments that involve using the body’s own immune system to target and treat disease. Today, multiple companies and institutions are developing drugs that combine disease-targeting agents with KLH. These disease-targeting agents do not evoke a robust immune response by themselves and thus require conjugation to a carrier molecule like KLH.
 
The versatility of the KLH molecule and its use in multiple drug development pipelines provide numerous commercial opportunities for us. KLH is currently utilized in immunotherapies in clinical or pre-clinical development for Alzheimer’s disease, metastatic breast cancer, type 1 diabetes, dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematous, ovarian cancer and various other cancers and diseases. The successful commercialization of one or more of these drug development pipelines, especially in a major indication, could have a significant impact on the industry’s ability to produce sufficient quantities of KLH. The protein is derived only from the Giant Keyhole Limpet, a scarce ocean mollusk that is native to a limited stretch of Pacific Ocean coastline. Due in part to the inherent limitations of utilizing of wild sources of KLH, we believe that aquaculture production methods, like the methods we practice, will be required to provide scalable, fully traceable supplies of KLH.
 
Based upon our specialized knowledge of aquaculture science and KLH, we have built unique land-based aquaculture, laboratory and production facilities in Port Hueneme, California, and developed production and manufacturing processes to produce clinical-grade KLH using Current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Using our proprietary aquaculture technology, we can support the marine mollusk from embryo to protein-producing adult, and we now support multiple generations of limpets grown entirely within our land-based aquaculture facility. We believe that other KLH suppliers do not have this capability and thus are reliant on scarce, wild populations of limpets.
 
We market and sell our KLH products under the brand Stellar KLH. Our customers and partners include multinational biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, clinical research organizations and research centers. We have multiple agreements to license and supply Stellar KLH and other technology in exchange for fees, revenues or royalties. Our customers manage and fund all product development and regulatory submissions for their respective drug products that utilize our KLH protein.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that we possess a number of competitive strengths that position us to become the world leader in the sustainable manufacture of GMP grade KLH, including:

· | Fully permitted, land-based aquaculture facility produces a barrier to market entry. Our proprietary methods, infrastructure and aquaculture facility give us the capability to support the source animal in aquaculture. Due to the time needed to raise the source animal to maturity, and the time needed to build and validate facilities and manufacturing processes, including water discharge permits, we believe that we have a five to seven year lead over any new market entrants attempting to produce KLH in a similar manner. Due to its exceptional size and complexity, KLH has not been reproduced synthetically.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fully traceable, GMP grade product offerings benefit commercialization programs. Using our proprietary production and manufacturing methods, we are able to produce a high quality, GMP grade KLH product that is fully traceable and controlled from native source to finished product, which we believe are important considerations for our pharmaceutical partners as they pursue later-stage trials and commercial introductions subject to more rigorous regulatory standards than early-stage research. Due to the known origin of material and continuity of data, we believe we are able to create a more consistent, high quality, immunogenic product than other KLH proteins in the market. In contrast, commercial supplies of KLH from other sources have historically differed widely in their source, traceability, purity, form and preparation, as well as their immunogenicity (their ability to stimulate an immune response). We believe that we are the only company that offers GMP grade KLH supported by fully traceable manufacturing methods.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Business model leverages growth potential and builds long-term relationships. We believe we have an attractive business model due to the unique nature of our product offerings, embedded growth opportunities within our customer base and operating leverage. We believe that our supply and collaboration agreements with drug developers, which include binding orders, allow us to better manage our working capital as well as build long-term relationships. As we increase production volumes and sales, we expect our operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue, providing for greater operating leverage.

· | Intellectual property portfolio includes protection for specialized systems and technologies. We have intellectual property related to KLH development and manufacturing and to the environmental protection of the Giant Keyhole Limpet, including patents, trade secrets and know-how related to specialized aquaculture systems and technologies; spawning, selection and maintenance of the species; non-lethal KLH protein extraction methods; and the processing, purification and production of KLH formulations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Safety profile and extensive citations in scientific literature contribute to the appeal of KLH as a carrier platform for immunotherapies. KLH has been used for decades in immune system testing, it has an extensive safety record, and continues to be selected for new immunotherapies preparing to enter clinical testing. According to a search on PubMed, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine, there are more than 3,600 publications referencing Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin in biomedical literature.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sustainability practices protect marine source and promote scalability. Our KLH protein is produced using environmentally sound, sustainable practices intended to protect and renew the live marine source. We believe this is a critical component of ensuring long-term, scalable supplies, since rapid growth in demand has had severe consequences to other related species. In California, for example, failure to manage wild populations of abalone resulted in dramatic declines and eventually led to closure of commercial abalone harvests.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leadership team provides extensive aquaculture production and related industry expertise. Our leadership team includes industry experts who have extensive experience in the field of aquaculture and Giant Keyhole Limpet production, and possess a deep understanding of a variety of biotechnology businesses. Our Chairman, President and CEO has more than 40 years of experience leading commercial aquaculture businesses and projects focused on mollusk domestication and production.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 
Our strategy seeks to expand the company’s growth potential while identifying opportunities to extract additional value from our KLH production capabilities and assets. Key elements of our business strategy include:

· | Sustain our market opportunity for KLH-conjugated vaccines. We aim to preserve the readiness of our KLH production assets and capabilities as customers with KLH-based drug candidates conduct clinical studies. This strategy seeks to preserve the opportunity for Stellar to share in the successful development and commercialization of product candidates utilizing our aquaculture-produced KLH products, while prudently managing our working capital. In 2018, we completed certain infrastructure improvements that will allow us to rapidly expand our production systems in a modular manner. As a result, we are able to culture only the number of animals needed for current demand.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Explore strategic arrangements with complementary technologies or businesses synergistic with our business. We are pursuing an array of opportunities within the field of biotechnology and immunotherapy with the aim to strengthen our technology portfolio as well as to create additional near-term value inflection opportunities. In particular we are interested in companies with validated clinical-stage assets, complementary technologies to KLH, and experienced clinical management staff.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursue additional supply and collaboration agreements. We plan to continue pursuing opportunities for commercial growth that build on our strengths and core competencies in KLH, including additional supply and collaboration agreements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop additional markets for our technology and products. We are committed to exploring new high potential therapeutic applications for KLH, such as clinical indications where the adjuvant and immune-stimulating properties of KLH may increase the efficacy or potency or broaden the potential patient population for certain immunotherapies. We believe that the best way to advance this strategy is through partnering or other strategic arrangements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin
 
KLH is a safe, potent, immune-stimulating protein. Specifically, it is a very large, high molecular weight, oxygen-carrying glycoprotein. In addition to the native molecule, KLH can be chemically dissociated into a subunit formulation. Both the native, high molecular weight molecule and subunit forms of KLH are excellent immune stimulants. The KLH molecular structure offers numerous sites for conjugation, and can generate multiple product configurations. Because of its large size, immune-stimulating properties, numerous sites for conjugation, and safety profile, KLH is used by researchers and product developers as a vaccine carrier protein. However, due to its exceptional size and complexity, KLH has not been reproduced synthetically.
 
KLH can be used as a carrier molecule, or it can be used as a finished, injectable product.
 
Page 5


As a carrier molecule, KLH is combined, or conjugated, to vaccine antigens that are used to promote the generation of antibody and cell-mediated immune responses against targeted diseases. By themselves, the small haptens (partial antigens) and vaccine antigens used to target these diseases are not usually immunogenic enough to awaken the immune system and therefore, require a carrier molecule or adjuvant, like KLH, in order to be effective. The combination of an antigen against specific pathogenic targets, such as tumors, and over-expressed proteins, conjugated to the immunogenic KLH molecule, is the basis for a promising new class of drugs in development known as active immunotherapies or therapeutic vaccines. Unlike preventative vaccines, active immunotherapies are designed to stimulate the body’s own immune system to generate an immune response to target and attack an existing disease or condition. We believe immunotherapies are, and will continue to be, one of the fastest-growing sectors of pharmaceutical research and development. KLH is an important component for drugs used in clinical or pre-clinical development for Alzheimer’s disease, metastatic breast cancer, type 1 diabetes, dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematous, ovarian cancer and various other cancers and diseases.
 
As a finished injectable product, KLH has been used extensively by pharmaceutical companies and researchers as a safe, immune-stimulating antigen in drug-screening, drug immunotoxicology, and assessment of immune status. KLH is a standard immunogen in T-Cell Dependent Antibody Response (TDAR), a functional assay which is widely recognized as a standard test for monitoring the effects of drugs on the immune system. Due to its adjuvant properties, finished injectable KLH has also been used to augment the efficacy of certain immunotherapies under development.
 
KLH protein is derived only from the Giant Keyhole Limpet (Megathura crenulata), a mollusk native only to a limited stretch of the Pacific Ocean coastline along Southern California and Baja California, Mexico. Historically, suppliers other than us have obtained KLH protein directly from wild and sensitive populations of Giant Keyhole Limpet, or have utilized lethal production processes. Based on publicly available information and reports, commercial supplies of KLH differ widely in their source, traceability, purity, form, and preparation, as well as in immunogenicity (their ability to stimulate an immune response). We believe that highly specialized aquaculture manufacturing methods, like the methods we practice, protect the KLH molecule’s source species and provide sustainable, scalable supplies of quality KLH protein. The concept of sustainability involves sound, responsible management of environmental resources and, especially where biological systems are concerned, includes protecting native species so that the species thrive and remain diverse and productive over time. Further, we believe that environmentally sound methods associated with professional and specialized aquaculture can minimize variability in KLH products and assure full traceability to their biological source.
 
Our Technology
 
We have spent more than 15 years developing and optimizing sustainable KLH production methods, specifically focused on protection of the Giant Keyhole Limpet and a patented, non-lethal method to extract KLH protein. We believe our proprietary methods will provide a scalable supply of GMP grade KLH and meet pharmaceutical industry standards for immune response, consistency, purity and traceability while protecting the natural source species. Utilizing our patented non-lethal method, KLH can be extracted from mature limpets multiple times per year. Once extracted, our KLH is processed and purified through our proprietary methods, which are protected as trade secrets. In addition to our internal manufacturing capabilities, we rely on contract manufacturing organizations and contract testing organizations for certain steps of GMP processing and quality control testing. The services performed by these contract vendors have included sterile fill/finish and product release testing.
 
Our proprietary aquaculture technology involves methods we developed and optimized to control the reproduction and growth of the Giant Keyhole Limpet including culture systems, nutritional requirements and the recirculation of seawater. We believe that other KLH suppliers do not have this capability and thus are reliant on scarce, wild populations of limpets. In 2018, we completed certain infrastructure improvements that will allow us to rapidly expand our production systems in a modular manner. As a result, we are able to culture only the number of animals needed for current demand. We plan to incrementally expand aquaculture infrastructure, which will thereby increase our KLH production capacity, in order to meet the anticipated future multi-kilogram KLH requirements of immunotherapy commercialization.
 
We also plan to continue optimizing our protein manufacturing processes. These activities are intended to increase the scalability and throughput capacity of existing manufacturing systems, which were originally developed to provide clinical development stage quantities of our Stellar KLH products. We plan to upgrade and scale our manufacturing operations to produce KLH suitable for commercial drugs by the time our customers are ready to file marketing applications referencing our DMFs. This will involve, in part, transferring our manufacturing method to a new Stellar-operated location or to a contract manufacturing organization or partner. The timing of such decision will be based on customer demand for Stellar KLH, among other considerations. 
 
As a result of these operational capabilities and plans, we believe we will be able to supply GMP grade KLH in commercial quantities to meet the anticipated long-term demand within the pharmaceutical industry, while protecting the natural source species. We base these beliefs on our intellectual property, achievements in aquaculture science, KLH production capabilities, KLH sustainable manufacturing know-how, and survey data used to estimate populations of Giant Keyhole Limpets in the wild.
 
Our Aquaculture and KLH Production Facilities
 
We maintain production facilities directly along the Pacific Ocean with dedicated, land-based aquaculture operations in Port Hueneme, California. We have approximately 37,000 square feet of leased aquaculture, manufacturing and laboratory space. At this location, our seawater supply and discharge system is fully permitted, which we believe is a competitive strength due in part to the time required and uncertainties related to obtaining new water discharge permits in the State of California. Our aquaculture operations include, among other specialized infrastructure, systems for spawning, larval development, and maturation of limpets, recirculating seawater supply systems and environmental controls. Our facility currently includes multiple production tanks and numerous individual limpet production modules in two independent aquaculture production systems. Each closed recirculating system is equipped with temperature controlled seawater distribution, filtration and treatment equipment.
Page 6


We are also investigating the establishment of additional aquaculture capabilities in Baja California, Mexico, including research collaborations with local organizations and companies, site suitability studies, raw material sourcing and the development of regional marine resources. We have also leased undeveloped land in Baja California since 2015. We believe these early-stage activities in Mexico will support our goal to meet the anticipated long-term industry demand for KLH protein.
Research and Development
 
Our research and development is focused primarily on the aquaculture of the Giant Keyhole Limpet as well as improvements in KLH protein characterization and manufacturing. These activities involve both internal programs and external collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies or research organizations.
 
Our internal research has included, among other activities, improvement of methods for the culture and growth of Giant Keyhole Limpet, developing proprietary formulated limpet diets, innovations in aquaculture systems and infrastructure, biophysical and biochemical characterization of the KLH molecule, analytical processes to enhance performance of our products, KLH manufacturing process improvements, new KLH formulations and KLH-related technologies, and new uses for KLH in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostic applications.
 
Our external collaborations have historically involved both development and evaluation projects, with multiple biopharmaceutical companies and research institutions, for the use of Stellar KLH in their programs. We believe that these collaborations provide for strategic, revenue and clinical opportunities for our future business by extending the commercial use of Stellar KLH and furthering our understanding of the KLH molecule.
 
For the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, our research and development expense were $2.09 million and $1.97 million, respectively. These amounts related mainly to research and development in aquaculture, improvements in analytical, manufacturing, and purification processes, stability studies and formulation development.
 
Our Stellar KLH Products
 
We offer Stellar KLH protein in various grades, formulations, custom configurations and fill finishes for both drug development and research applications. Our portfolio includes GMP products suitable for our customers’ Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies as well as research-grade products. Our KLH is primarily intended for: conjugation as a carrier molecule in therapeutic vaccines; assessing immune function; augmenting the efficacy of immunotherapies; and, in immunotoxicology studies, for monitoring the immunomodulatory effects of drug candidates. We also offer KLH-based in vitro diagnostic kits for research and preclinical use.
 
The list price for bulk Stellar KLH protein ranges from approximately $25,000 to $55,000 per gram, depending on the purity, grade, preparation, packaging configuration and volume ordered. We also market certain custom vialed formulations at a significant premium over bulk pricing. We currently have limited revenue from sales of our Stellar KLH products. Product sales volumes have been highly dependent and subject to variability associated with the rate of development and progression of clinical studies of third-party immunotherapies and other technologies that utilize our products. The rate of progression towards later stage studies is expected to continue to affect the timing and volume of future product sales. The advancement and commercial success of third-party products utilizing Stellar KLH is dependent upon many factors, including available capital, trial recruitment and progress, trial success, and regulatory review and approval.

Supply Agreements, Collaboration Agreements and Contracts
 
We have entered into, and intend to continue to enter into, agreements with third parties that will allow us to supply Stellar KLH in exchange for fees, revenues or royalties. Supply agreements generally involve a customer’s commitment to purchase our Stellar KLH for use in the customer’s own immunotherapy products or as a finished product in their development programs or therapies. In return, we license and provide exclusive or priority supply in a given field and territory, and provide technical and regulatory support. When applicable, we also agree to maintain a drug master file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the KLH product. Our current supply agreements are limited to clinical trials and typically have an initial multi-year term, which may be renewed by customers for additional one-year periods. Our supply agreements also typically provide us with first negotiation rights for the supply of KLH in connection with potential future commercialization of a customer’s products.
 
To date, our Stellar KLH protein has been used in research and development, preclinical and clinical phases of development but has not yet been used in any commercialized and marketed drug products. Quantities required for clinical trials depend on, among other variables, the nature of the trial, the clinical indication, the number of patients enrolled, dosing regimens and vaccine manufacturing processes. We plan to upgrade and scale our manufacturing operations to produce KLH suitable for commercial drugs by the time our customers are ready to file marketing applications referencing our DMFs.
 
We have supply agreements with Araclon Biotech SL, a privately-held biotechnology company headquartered in Spain and majority-owned by global healthcare company Grifols; Amaran Biotechnology, Inc., a biopharmaceuticals manufacturer based in Taiwan that manufactures a KLH conjugate vaccine for OBI Pharma, Inc., a publicly-listed Taiwan biotech company; and Neovacs S.A., a publicly listed French biotechnology company. Our customers manage and fund all product development and regulatory submissions for their respective drug products that utilize Stellar KLH. 
 
Neostell Joint Venture Agreement
 
In May 2016, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Neovacs S.A., a publicly-held biotechnology company in Paris, France for the formation of a joint venture company to manufacture and sell conjugated therapeutic vaccines. In July 2016, Neostell S.A.S., a French simplified stock corporation (Neostell), was formed to carry out the business of the joint venture. Neostell is expected to produce Neovacs’ Kinoid immunotherapy product candidates which utilize Stellar KLH as a carrier molecule. Neostell may also manufacture and sell other KLH-based immunotherapy products for third-party customers worldwide. We hold a 30% equity interest in the joint venture in exchange for an initial capital contribution of €120,000. One-half of the initial contribution, approximately $67,000, was paid in June 2016 with the balance due upon the occurrence of certain defined future events. We will also provide additional financing to Neostell, as may be required, on a pro rata basis in line with our equity interest. According to the joint venture agreement, as amended February 2018, if certain milestones are not achieved by December 31, 2018, Neostell will be dissolved, unless the parties mutually agree to pursue the joint venture arrangement, or either party decides to purchase the equity interests of the other party. On July 3, 2018, Neovacs published the results of its Phase 2b clinical study for IFN-Alpha-Kinoid immunotherapy in systemic lupus erythematosus, and the parties are currently in discussions regarding certain Neostell milestones and the advancement of Neovacs’ KLH based immunotherapy in lupus. Each of the parties is entitled, upon the occurrence of certain defined events, to acquire the interest of the other party. Except as otherwise described herein, the joint venture has an initial ten-year term, renewable for successive five-year terms. If either party provides notice at least six months prior to the expiration date of an applicable term that it does not wish to continue its participation in the joint venture, the other party will have a right to acquire all of such terminating party’s equity interests in Neostell. In connection with the formation of Neostell and the execution of its strategy, the parties intend over time to enter into an exclusive supply agreement within a limited field of use for Stellar to supply KLH to Neostell, a supply agreement designating Neostell as the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of the Neovacs’ vaccines, and services agreements for the provision of various knowledge and expertise by each of the parties. Neovacs will also license certain of its intellectual property to Neostell.

Intellectual Property and License Agreements
 
We hold important proprietary intellectual property related to KLH development and manufacture and to the environmental protection of the Giant Keyhole Limpet, which we protect primarily as trade secrets. This intellectual property includes specialized aquaculture systems and technologies; spawning, selection and maintenance of the Giant Keyhole Limpet; non-lethal KLH protein extraction methods; and the processing, purification and production of KLH formulations. Our proprietary methods also include methods for the control of larval development, metamorphosis and maturation of the Giant Keyhole Limpets.
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product technology and know-how, to operate without infringing proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing, when appropriate, U.S. and foreign patent applications relating to our technology, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. We also require our employees, and to the extent practicable, our consultants and advisors with whom we expect to work on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions made in the course of our working relationship with them, while using our intellectual property or which relate to our business. 
 
We hold patent protection for our non-lethal extraction methods of hemocyanin in the United States and other countries, including one issued patent in the United States, U.S. Patent No. 6,852,338, which currently expires in 2023, and covers a two-step method for obtaining hemolymph from a live gastropod mollusk. This U.S. patent was originally granted to our Chief Executive Officer, Frank Oakes, who assigned the patent to the Company in August 2002. Foreign patent counterparts were granted in Canada, France and Germany.
 
The scope of any patent protection may not exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us, and any of our patents may not be held valid if subsequently challenged, and others may claim rights in or ownership of our patents and proprietary rights. Furthermore, others may develop products similar to our products and may duplicate any of our products or design around our patents.
 
Our common law trademarks include, but are not limited to, “Powering and Improving Immunotherapy™”, “Stellar KLH™” and “KLH Site™”. In addition to patents and trademarks, we rely on trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights.
 
Competition
 
The immunotherapy industry is rapidly evolving and new competitors with competing technologies and products are regularly entering clinical development and the market. We compete on the basis of: the advantages and disadvantages of Stellar KLH as compared to other KLH proteins manufactured by our competitors; our ability to educate the industry about the high quality, and sustainable and traceable features, of Stellar KLH; our future ability to supply scalable quantities of GMP grade KLH; product efficacy; customer service; and the price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness of Stellar KLH as compared to our competitors. We believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors. However, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. We compete directly with Biosyn Corporation, and with SAFC, a division of Sigma-Aldrich that has historically offered KLH products. In addition to competition from current suppliers of KLH, we also face indirect competition from developers of other carrier proteins, adjuvants or therapeutic vaccine platforms. We are unable to predict what effect evolution of the KLH and immunotherapy industries and potential new entrants may have on price, selling strategies, intellectual property or our competitive position.
Government Regulation
 
Our operations, including our aquaculture and harvesting activities, as well as production operations, manufacturing site development, and drug research, development and sales, are subject to complex regulation at the local, state and federal levels in the United States by a number of regulatory agencies including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy, the Regional Water Quality Control Board Los Angeles Region, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the California Coastal Commission, the California Air Pollution Control Board, the County of Ventura, the City of Port Hueneme and the Oxnard Harbor District.
 
We are subject to laws and regulations covering clean water and waste discharge, and are required to hold licenses for the aquaculture production and wild harvesting of the Giant Keyhole Limpet. Our aquaculture facility is subject to regulation by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region. These agencies impose regulations that restrict any activity that could pose a potential risk to the California marine environment including, but not limited to, seawater waste discharge limitations specified in our National Pollution Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) permit. We regularly monitor our KLH production and manufacturing processes for material compliance with applicable regulations.
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we may be subject to a variety of foreign regulations related to research, manufacturing, and the commercial sale and distribution of our products, to the extent we choose to manufacture, sell or distribute any products outside of the United States. The requirements governing our activities in jurisdictions outside the United States vary greatly from country to country. 
 
Page 9


In Mexico, our current research and development activities and collaborations, and potential future operations, are subject to regulation, permitting and oversight by the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA), including the National Service of Health, Food Safety and Quality (SENASICA), the National Commission of Fisheries and Aquaculture (CONAPESCA), and the National Institute of Fisheries and Aquaculture (INAPESCA), all of which are administrative bodies of SAGARPA. We are also subject to regulation, permitting and oversight by the Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), the Secretariat of Health’s Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS), and by and other state and local agencies.
Compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices
 
The FDA and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving approval from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. All facilities and manufacturing techniques used for the manufacture of our products must comply with applicable regulations governing the production of pharmaceutical products known as Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Some manufacturing controls and the extent of manufacturing controls needed to achieve appropriate product quality differ not only between investigational and commercial manufacture, but also among the various phases of clinical trials, with later stage clinical trials requiring more extensive controls and documentation. In particular, concurrent with later stage clinical trials, suppliers of biologic materials, including KLH, must develop additional information about the physical characteristics of their biologic products as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the material in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. Where applicable, manufacturers are also expected to implement manufacturing controls that reflect product and manufacturing considerations, evolving process and product knowledge, and manufacturing experience. We are responsible for regularly assessing compliance with GMP requirements through record reviews and periodic audits and for ensuring that we take corrective action for any identified deficiencies.
 
The FDA and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may issue warning or similar letters or may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions against us. To date, we have not been subject to inspection by the FDA or other drug regulatory agency because none of our customers or partners has filed an application in any country for marketing approval of a product encompassing our Stellar KLH protein.
 
New Drug Development
 
None of our KLH products have been subject to approval as a drug by any regulatory authority. However, a number of our customers and strategic partners are utilizing Stellar KLH in the development of pharmaceuticals and immunotherapies that would be subject to the regulatory approval process in various jurisdictions. The regulatory approval process for new drugs under development by our customers is typically long and expensive. Clinical trials that they conduct may not be successful and such products may not receive regulatory approval.

Corporate Information
 
We operate through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Stellar Biotechnologies, Inc., a California corporation which was organized September 9, 1999. We acquired the subsidiary on April 12, 2010 through a reverse merger and began trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) under the symbol “KLH” on April 19, 2010. We were originally incorporated in Canada on June 12, 2007 under the name China Growth Capital, Inc. and subsequently changed our name to CAG Capital, Inc. on April 15, 2008. We began trading on the TSX Venture Exchange as a Canadian capital pool company on August 29, 2008, and were continued as a British Columbia corporation on November 25, 2009. Our reverse merger in April 2010 constituted our “qualifying transaction” under Canadian law, at which time we changed our name to Stellar Biotechnologies, Inc. In January 2013, we began trading on the U.S. OTCQB Marketplace under the symbol “SBOTF” and, on November 5, 2015, our common shares began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq) under the symbol “SBOT.” On March 29, 2016, at our request, our common shares were voluntarily delisted from the TSX-V in Canada and ceased trading on the TSX-V as of the close of business on April 8, 2016.

Smaller Reporting Company
 
We are currently a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and are thus allowed to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that an independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and have certain other reduced disclosure obligations with respect to our SEC filings.
