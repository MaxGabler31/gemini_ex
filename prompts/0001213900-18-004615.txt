Overview of Business
 
Our mission is to provide expertise, technology, and capital to help make clean water available for all. Specifically, we have the following initiatives:
 

1. | We license our technology worldwide to treat heavily polluted waters and also to remove harmful micro-contaminants from drinking water, using minimal energy, chemicals, and materials.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | We are building a network of customer-facing water service companies to expand our global market presence and our technical expertise.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | In our latest proprietary development as a water technology company, we have conceptualized our blockchain-based WaterChain™ initiative to fund next-generation water recycling systems that can propel the world’s water supply forward into a cleaner future. We have created a concept document and have recruited an initial team of advisors. We received initial technical advice and we are now raising additional funds to architect and develop the WaterChain program. It is very likely that the initial WaterChain vision will change dramatically as we develop the program. We have not defined the final nature of any coins, tokens or other instruments, and we may not be able to raise the capital needed to execute on this concept.

Water is our most valuable resource, and the mission of OriginClear is to improve the quality of water and help return it to its original and clear condition.
 
OriginClear Group™
 
Outsourcing is a fast-growing reality in water treatment. Tougher regulations, water scarcities and general outsourcing trends are driving industrial and agricultural water treatment users to delegate their water problem to service providers. As Global Water Intelligence pointed out in their report on October 30, 2015, “Water is often perceived as a secondary importance, with end-users increasingly wanting to focus solely on their own core business. This is driving a move away from internal water personnel towards external service experts to take control of water aspects.” External service experts are typically small–privately owned and locally operated. Consolidating these companies could lead to enormous economies of scale through sharing of best practices, technologies, and customers.
 
Decentralization is an even greater trend in water, similar to what has been seen in energy decentralization through solar and wind off-grid generation.
 
​ Water is becoming increasingly scarcer. ​McKinsey’s Transforming ​Water Economies ​forecasts that ​“without ​action, global ​water demand ​could outstrip ​supply by up to ​40 percent by ​2030.” ​Furthermore, existing water infrastructure in the United States is aging and water loss is increasing.
 
According to ​Lux Research, ​updating our ​national water ​infrastructure ​will require an ​investment of $​270 billion ​– money ​that will be ​hard to pull ​together for ​projects that ​could take ​decades to ​complete. ​In the meantime, centralized water systems are forcing water users to treat their own ​water with ​small, modular ​water treatment ​systems.
 
OriginClear is ​acquiring ​companies to ​help industrial ​water users ​treat their ​water ​themselves, and often reuse ​it. We believe ​those companies ​are going to ​grow tremendously ​because of this ​“local ​water” ​growth trend. ​We believe that assembling a group of water treatment companies is an opportunity for significant growth and increased Company value for the stockholders.

Progressive Water Treatment Inc.
 
On October 1, 2015, OriginClear announced it had acquired 100 percent of Dallas-based Progressive Water Treatment Inc. (“PWT”), a fast-growing designer, builder and service provider for a wide range of industrial water treatment applications.
 
This marked the first transaction in OriginClear’s corporate strategy to acquire leading U.S. water service companies focused on specialized water treatment. OriginClear aims to offer a complementary, end-to-end offering to serve growing corporate demand for outsourced water treatment. The Company acquired PWT through the exchange of all issued and outstanding shares of PWT for 10,000 shares of the Company’s newly designated Series B Preferred Stock.
 
PWT’s Business
 
Since 1995, PWT has been designing and manufacturing a complete line of water treatment systems for municipal, industrial and pure water applications. Known as an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), PWT utilizes a wide range of technologies, including chemical injection, media filters, membrane, ion exchange and SCADA technology, in turnkey systems that it designs and builds. PWT also offers a broad range of services including maintenance contracts, retrofits and replacement assistance. In addition, PWT rents equipment through contracts of varying duration. Customers are primarily served in the United States and Canada, with PWT’s reach extending worldwide from Japan to Argentina to the Middle East.
 
On January 17, 2017, we announced that PWT completed its third major power plant project in 2016 which included the installation and startup of a $2 million boiler feedwater system for a power plant operated by a major Midwestern public utility.
 
On October 31, 2017, we announced that PWT more than doubled its revenue from Q2 to Q3 2017 and our initial guidance ahead of quarterly filings indicated revenues on growth trend.
 
On February 23, 2018, we announced that, after doubling from Q2 to Q3 2017, PWT maintained its performance in Q4 2017.
 
PWT had four major customers for the year ended December 31, 2017. The customers represented 54.5% of billings for the year ending December 31, 2017.
 
OriginClear is currently in discussions for additional, accretive acquisitions of companies specializing in complementary markets and applications. However, no assurance can be given that the Company will complete these acquisitions.
 
Technology Licensing
 
For its first eight years of operations, OriginClear focused uniquely on development and commercialization of its breakthrough Electro Water Separation™ technology. In 2015, the technology went into commercial phase, and the Company launched it as OriginClear Technologies, operating in parallel to the Group. The mission of OriginClear Technologies is to develop Electro Water Separation™ and achieve its full recognition as an international industry standard in treating our increasingly complex wastewater treatment challenges. For this purpose, OriginClear Technologies relies on an ongoing strong R&D and engineering activity for the development of its technology, while actively building its network of partners, licensees and joint venture partners for commercial development. A key element of this strategy is OriginClear (HK), OriginClear’s wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong that manages Asia-Pacific market development, with a special focus on China sales and manufacturing. While OriginClear Technologies focuses on developing and monetizing the Company’s internally-developed Intellectual Property, best practices and trade secrets, it is expected to do the same for technologies which may come in the future with the Group’s acquisition of profitable water treatment companies.

The Technology
 
OriginClear is the proprietary developer of EWS, the high-speed, primarily chemical-free technology to clean up large quantities of water. It removes oils, suspended solids, certain dissolved solids, and pathogens, in a continuous and energy-efficient process. The Company originally developed this technology to solve the challenge of removing microalgae from a highly dilute state. The EWS technology remains the most efficient non-chemical, continuous mechanism for the concentration of live algae cells from water.


The electro-chemical process was then extended, first to cleaning up oil and gas waste water and most recently, to industrial, agricultural and urban effluents. These water treatment applications are entirely electrochemical in nature and do not rely on algae for its cleaning capabilities, which is a separate application of the technology. EWS is designed to be an early step in removal of oils, solids and pathogens; reducing the work that more expensive, downstream processes such as Ultra Filtration or Reverse Osmosis must do, therefore enabling more cost-efficient and high-volume water cleanup overall.
 
In March of 2016, OriginClear announced that it had successfully developed and proved Advanced Oxidation for its breakthrough water cleanup system, EWS. University laboratory tests have shown that EWS with Advanced Oxidation (EWS:AOx™) can now extract dissolved contaminants, which are otherwise difficult to remove without chemicals such as chlorine. Overall, the system has shown a dramatic reduction in Total Organic Compounds which includes all forms of organic contamination, solids, miscible or dissolved, to meet new stringent global discharge requirements. Even prior to this innovation, EWS, combined with an iSep ultrafiltration membrane, demonstrated up to a 99.9% removal of dispersed oil, 99.5% removal of suspended solids as well as successful treatment of chemical oxygen demand (COD), including specific contaminants such as ammonia, phosphorus and hydrogen sulfide. These results were presented at the International Water Conference in 2015. In 2016, OriginClear filed for a patent to protect the new AOx process and system configuration.
 
Today, we are capable of pairing the two technologies as EWS:AOx™, or separately, as the application requires. OriginClear believes that its technology is valuable to the industry because it has the potential to greatly extend the life of membranes and filters by effectively treating very dirty, oily water, while reducing chemical use significantly.
 
OriginClear also believes that its Advanced Oxidation technology will help neutralize harmful micro-contaminants, such as industrial solvents, which is difficult or impossible to achieve with other technologies.
 
Overall, the system has shown a dramatic reduction in Total Organic Compounds which includes all forms of organic contamination, solids, miscible or dissolved, to meet new stringent global discharge requirements.
 
Recent Developments
 
We have been engaged in our business operations since June 2007, and to date, we have been primarily involved in research and development activities, with licensing to OEMs, and sales of pilot and demonstration equipment beginning in June of 2010. Commercial sales by both OriginClear and its licensees and joint ventures began in 2014.
 
Our technology integrates easily with other industry processes. We have begun to embed our technology into larger systems through licensing and joint ventures.
 
In 2017, OriginClear accomplished the following milestones in the Technology division:
 
In March 2017, OriginClear entered into a license agreement with a Spanish industrial group, Montajes Longares and its subsidiary, Depuporc SL (“Depuporc”). Depuporc has developed an integrated waste water treatment system targeting animal farming and more particularly pig farms. Spain is Europe’s largest pig producing country. OriginClear’s technology, EWS:AOx, will be a core component of Depuporc’s patented system.
 
Also in March 2017, OriginClear entered into a master research agreement with Florida Atlantic University (FAU) in Boca Raton, Florida. This partnership establishes a cooperative framework for further scientific research and validation projects pertaining to OriginClear’s technology, EWS:AOx, when applied to landfill leachate treatment.

In April and May 2017, OriginClear demonstrated its technology’s efficiency for Produced Water treatment at Sinopec Group’s shale gas site in China’s Shandong Province. Sinopec Group is Asia's largest oil and gas company, and the second largest in the world, as listed in the Fortune Global 500.
 
In July 2017, OriginClear entered India via a license agreement with Permionics Global Technologies LLP, the emerging technologies division of Permionics Membranes Pvt Ltd, a leading Indian filtration and membrane solutions provider for process, waste water recycling and water treatment.
 
From August 2017 onwards, OriginClear engaged into an internal R&D program targeting the removal of microtoxins in drinking water. The first series of tests focused on a key chemical in Roundup® glyphosate, which has been reported to be present in up to 70% of drinking water in the US. After several test rounds at the La Kretz Advanced Prototyping Center, OriginClear demonstrated real-time virtual elimination of glyphosate at concentrations of parts per billion, equivalent to the contamination level in drinking water. A summary report of the test is available at https://www.originclear.com/tech/microtoxin-reduction.
 
On September 26, 2017, OriginClear filed a provisional patent to protect a newly developed electrode configuration that significantly increases direct contact of the contaminants in water with the electrodes surface, where the strongest oxidation reactions occur. During the tests that were done on low concentration herbicides in fresh water, this new electrode design also showed ability to efficiently address low electrical conductivity water streams, thus also solving a major energy consumption issue with these types of water.
 
In December 2017, OriginClear announced a preliminary agreement with the National Superior Engineering School (ENSIL-ENSCI) of France’s University of Limoges, to validate OriginClear’s process, EWS:AOx, for extremely challenging water treatment problems such as landfill runoff and flooding from major storms and hurricanes. This partnership will provide a framework similar to the partnership with FAU, but targeting European markets.
 
WaterChain, Inc.
 
WaterChain, Inc. was incorporated in December, 2017 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of OriginClear, Inc. OriginClear is a technology company and WaterChain is our latest invention. It is a way to raise capital for next-generation, decentralized water treatment and recycling projects all over the world.
 
An opportunity exists to create a new generation of water projects that take advantage of recent innovations in on-site water treatment systems and practices. We believe these can dramatically improve speed and costs, making it far easier to treat and recycle water. The technologies are known; creating new capital for their implementation, and potentially deploying Distributed Ledger Technology (“DLT”) or “blockchain” are new.
 
Although it is still in the early stage and there can be no assurance of success, we intend to develop and launch an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to provide some capital for and scale up a series of advanced water treatment and recycling systems. If we are successful with our ICO, we plan to implement a Project Management Organization (PMO) to implement a transparent and fair process to select projects, technologies and practices.
 
We plan to deploy DLT within these systems as appropriate and scale up with the active involvement of the water industry to help meet the global water crisis.
 
We intend to adhere to securities law to the fullest extent possible in our ICO and related funding efforts and have retained specialized counsel to that effect. The “coin” may take any form, for example as an asset class, or as equity in OriginClear.

WaterChain, Inc. Recent Developments
 
In February, 2018, we announced that we had engaged London-based, The Coin Lab, to help develop the WaterChain concept, and that we had filed for patent protection on a token ecosystem for improved efficiency of transactions in the water industry.
 
Later that month, we announced that we had presented our WaterChain strategy at d10e Silicon Valley.
 
On April 13, 2018, OriginClear began conducting a private placement for the sale of up to 50,000,000 units, each consisting of (i) one share of the Company’s 0% Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series D “Preferred Stock”) and (ii) one coin purchase right. The purchase price for each unit is $.02 for aggregate potential proceeds of $1,000,000, with available discounts ranging from 10% to 30% to investments above $50,000 to $250,000 or greater, respectively. The private placement is intended in part to fund the development of WaterChain. The Company may increase the offering amount to $2,000,000 at its sole discretion. This has a potential dilutive effect on the Company as follows: if every investor receives the maximum discount of 30%, then the maximum number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock can increase to over 142 million shares, convertible into shares of Common Stock. Additionally, if a future capital raising event for WaterChain does not occur, the number of shares that are granted pursuant to this offering may be multiplied by 2, causing the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to this offering to exceed 284 million shares convertible into shares of Common Stock.


Looking Ahead
 
In 2018, OriginClear hopes to achieve the following:
 

● | Continued growth of PWT’s revenues and profits. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | One or more acquisitions of a profitable water treatment service provider. 
● | Breakeven and profitability of OriginClear Technologies. 
● | WaterChain ICO. 
● | Fund and complete the first Proof of Concept (POC) water treatment system under the WaterChain funding mechanism. 

Our Strategy
 
We currently operate three synergistic lines of business:
 

1. | The OriginClear Group 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | OriginClear Technologies 
3. | WaterChain Inc. 

The OriginClear Group
 
The OriginClear Group’s strategy is to grow incrementally by focusing on the water treatment services market, acquiring the hands-on service suppliers in this market. It intends to develop a network of these wholly-owned water treatment companies to meet the needs of end users from all industries with a full range of treatment technologies. Due to increased regulation, water treatment recycling challenges and a need to focus on their own core business, many water users today are outsourcing their water treatment needs to outside experts. In addition, we have identified a major trend in decentralization of water treatment, which we believe will cause small water service companies to grow. There will be significant synergies within the Group as technology, manufacturing expertise, market knowledge, projects and opportunities are shared. The target acquisitions must be accretive in nature with solid sales growth and profitability. The acquired companies must have a solid management team to accelerate their previous growth with excellent customer service. Initially, the acquisition focus is in the U.S. but will be expanded internationally in a few years.
 
OriginClear Technologies
 
We are licensors of our technology. We grant non-exclusive licenses to OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), and participate in joint ventures, contributing our technology and our commitment to each joint venture’s business focus. We have also begun to grant Master Licenses, beginning with our wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong.
 
Technology Applications
 

1. | Algae Harvesting 
---+----------------------------------------------------------

 
Algae is one of nature′s most efficient and versatile photosynthetic factories. It has a short growing cycle and does not require arable land or fresh water, which makes it very attractive as an energy feedstock, or as a healthy and natural feed or fertilizer. But a major barrier to commercialization is the difficulty in extracting small amounts of algae biomass from very large quantities of water at a reasonable cost and without using more energy than can be created. And the quantities of water required can be very large indeed: algae-to-water ratio can be as high as 1-to-1000. Conventional water separation technologies such as centrifuges and membranes may work on a limited basis, but can be too expensive for large-scale use. Additionally, centrifuges are typically a batch process.

Algae harvesting is OriginClear’s historical activity, which also laid the technology groundwork for the company’s subsequent applications development. It started with Single Step Extraction™ (SSE). Today, SSE is the first stage in EWS and it powers our sanitation and growth optimizing applications.
 
Algae for Soil Enrichment
 
In 2015, OriginClear began developing the use of algae for soil enrichment with partner AlgEternal. Based on AlgEternal’s field tests, it believes that its pure algae concentrate, harvested with OriginClear technology, may reduce conventional fertilizer cost by up to 40 percent.
 
In 2016, the FREEWATERBOX® developed by OriginClear joint venture Ennesys completed a field pilot in Dubai. It is based on the use of micro-algae for the removal or biotransformation of pollutants, including nutrients and xenobiotics from wastewater and CO2 from waste air, while producing a soil conditioner for the enhancement and protection of agricultural crops.
 

2. | The Oil and Gas Industry 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The oil and gas industry is one of the most water-intensive industries in the world. It is both a large consumer of fresh water and producer of contaminated water, which is also a potential asset for drought-affected regions. Water is produced and used in large quantities in oil and gas operations. In the United States, an average of 7 barrels of contaminated water is generated for each 1 barrel of oil produced. Greentech Media reports that energy companies pay between $3 to $12 to dispose of each barrel of produced water. We believe OriginClear’s Electro Water Separation™ technology is ideally suited to help clean up the large quantities of water used in oil and gas operations. A 2009 report on modern shale gas by the Groundwater Protection Council, "Modern Shale Gas Development in the United States: A Primer," stated that “the amount of water needed to drill and fracture a horizontal shale gas well generally ranges from about 2 million to 4 million gallons, depending on the basin and formation characteristics.” While fracking technology promises to unleash an abundant supply of inexpensive natural gas to power the modern world, water is quickly becoming a serious limiting factor. Additionally, the water returns as “frack flowback” laced with petroleum and contaminants that require rapid and efficient removal for disposal and recycling.
 
Oil and Gas Water Cleanup Solutions
 
The Company has completed successful trials in the Niobrara gas fields of Colorado, the Permian light crude oil fields of West Texas and the Monterey heavy crude oil fields in California. The Bakersfield testing demonstrated that produced water from heavy oil in California’s Monterey Shale Formation could technically and economically be reprocessed for Cyclic Steam Stimulation in oil wells and agricultural irrigation water. EWS removes up to 99.9% of all free and emulsified oil, and 99.5% of suspended solids from oil & gas wastewater, while also removing certain dissolved contaminants that will co-precipitate, and continuously disinfecting bacteria. In the oil and gas application, OriginClear’s core EWS technology is typically supplemented with ‘heavies’ removal on the front end, intelligent controls, and a final polishing system, for a complete solution.
 
Through its licensees and joint venture partners, OriginClear is making EWS available, either as a stand-alone solution or integrated with up- and downstream treatment modules, to customers such as: E&P operators, service companies, disposal well operators and water treatment companies.
 

3. | Industrial and agricultural Waste Water 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Perhaps the largest of all opportunities for EWS is in cleaning up industrial, agricultural and urban effluents. EWS is an electrically-based technology that can target any application in waste water treatment, with a focus on the “clarity” stage of removing oils, suspended solids and bacteria. EWS technology has been shown to effectively clean organics such as petroleum, achieving up to 99.9% reduction in free oil and a 99.5% reduction in suspended solids, and reduction of up to 99% of bacteria and other invaders, for clean and sanitized effluents. Another EWS prototype has been demonstrated in China for landfill leachate treatment. EWS alone achieved a 75% reduction in leachate’s Chemical Oxygen Demand, a marker of contamination level that includes suspended solids and dissolved contamination as well, and 70% reduction in Ammonia.

The Advanced Oxidation complement to EWS known as EWS:AOx™, announced in March of 2016, shows promise to neutralize micro-contaminants such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and dioxane, an industrial solvent which has been found extensively in aquifers in Southern California and elsewhere. We also believe that EWS:AOx can be valuable in neutralizing many other anthropogenic organic compounds (AOCs), including endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Further testing, with the assistance of a regional water district, is underway at our headquarters in the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI).
 
WaterChain™: Decentralized Water Funding
 
WaterChain, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
As an organization, we want to create cleaner water for the world, and often the biggest hurdles are not related to our ability to actually clean water, but instead to finance, business, and regulation.
 
We intend to partner with some of the brightest minds across the blockchain community and the water industry, to develop an entirely new funding mechanism and set of accompanying technologies that will propel the world’s water supply forward into a cleaner future.
 
Speeding up Water
 
The global water services industry is on track to become a trillion-dollar industry by 2020, and experts agree that “water is the oil of the 21st century.” By 2030, world demand for water will outstrip supply by 40 percent, and close to half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas (United Nations Environment Programme report, Green Economy, March 21, 2016).
 
Only one country in the world recycles more than 20% of its water, while the US itself only recycles 1% (Fluence, February 15, 2017). The world’s clean water crisis will create both a financial crisis and global dislocation.
 
Recent droughts have caused water prices to spike in the double digits. “Conservation surcharges” could easily add on 20% more cost, and these coming water scarcities could dramatically affect many businesses and economies.
 
The humanitarian issue goes far beyond the problem of business disruption. Nearly all sewage is never treated, and more people die from unsafe water annually than from all forms of violence, including war. As large as it is, the global water industry is still well short of its potential scope.
 
Growing at just 4% annually, the water industry isn’t ramping up fast enough to meet the coming crisis. The biggest issue is our aging infrastructure, which now needs more than quarter trillion dollars to update in the US alone.
 
Because our infrastructure is not being modernized fast enough, municipalities are starting to refuse untreated water, in turn requiring industrial, commercial, agricultural, and large residential users to treat their own water.
 
Since treating water is not their core business, the users outsource the problem to local water service providers and avoid capital expense by paying only for water when it is cleaned. This pay-for-performance model is a risky proposition for smaller service companies and their financiers, and as a result the outsourcing trend, while inevitable, is not progressing quickly enough to meet the growing demand for more water treatment.
 
Meanwhile, individuals who want to help the world meet its water crisis can often only donate to nonprofit projects, most of which are focused on providing clean water to the developing world. The average investor cannot invest in clean water projects as a means to improve the water industry and simultaneously participate in the economic upsides of those initiatives.

The water industry needs a 21st century platform that speeds up funding for new water treatment facilities, encourages the use of the best current and future technologies, and allows investors access to the growth potential of the water industry.
 
Decentralized Investing in Water Treatment Facilities
 
WaterChain intends to create the infrastructure, both on- and off-blockchain, with the potential to quickly increase the number of modular, connected water treatment facilities worldwide. Through an initial coin offering (ICO), we intend to offer investors the opportunity to participate in the sharing of future profits generated by water projects deployed with WaterChain capital. The “coin” or “token” may take any form, for example as an asset class, or as equity in OriginClear.
 
We intend to rapidly deploy a Proof of Concept system with the proceeds of early funding rounds. In this way, we will be demonstrating the value of next-generation water treatment systems while we develop the full WaterChain infrastructure and also complete our major capital raises.
 
Beyond the first project, capital raised from the ICO is intended to develop WaterChain technology and operational infrastructure, sustain the organization until enough Return on Investment is generated to reward investors and fund future water projects, and create an independent organization that will oversee the projects being deployed using WaterChain capital.
 
There already exists a new generation of water treatment technology. By assembling the best minds in the water treatment industry and funding them with capital raised from the crypto community, these technologies can deliver new water treatment facilities faster and at a lower cost compared to existing methods. At the same time, investors know they are helping the world to solve its growing water problem while potentially being rewarded with a share of the profits from those efforts.
 
We also intend to work with existing financing actors to leverage this capital and make the funding go further. We believe that as the asset base grows, the value of our security token will reflect this appreciated value and make further deployments possible. In addition, we plan to set up a token reserve for future expansion.
 
Our Future Vision
 
Within the current water ecosystem, there are inherent challenges with water monitoring and payments between water users, service providers, technology licensors, and investors. The industry is ready for next-generation integration, transparency, and automation, and we believe we will be well positioned to develop and fund a frictionless and high-speed ecosystem for water treatment.
 
We intend to implement Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in the water treatment projects themselves. If a utility token were used in this context, it would have no value as an investment vehicle and would be deployed only to manage, execute, and settle smart contracts on the WaterChain water treatment and recycling project platform.
 
Competitors
 
The Algae Industry
 
Companies in the new algae fuels industry tend to organize themselves as integrated producers and to keep their intellectual property to themselves. Our strategy, on the other hand, is to share our technology widely through licensing and private labeling. With respect to our algae harvesting and sanitizing applications, we are aware that Alfa Laval, Algix, Aurora Algae, Cavitation Technologies, Evodos, New Oil Resources, Open Algae LLC, Perlemax, Valicor, Smartflow Technologies, Westfalia and World Water Works, among others, offer competing technologies. OriginClear believes there is synergy between its process and many of these competing technologies, where EWS can do the “heavy lifting” as the first, high-speed concentration stage, with other processes offering further concentration.

The Oil and Gas Industry
 
Market and Trends
 
The oil and gas industry is a major source of waste water. In the US, it generates about seven barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. More recently the flowback water from fracking operations is a short term, but intensive, source of waste water as well. Historically the solution to the treatment of produced and frack flowback water has primarily been to dispose it in permitted injection wells. Many technologies have existed for the “filtering” of these waters prior to injection, but with limited ability to remove contaminants. More recently, because of the cost of water management, environmental concerns and regulatory requirements, these “filtering” technologies are being reviewed and new technologies are being developed; the goal being to reduce water management costs and to dramatically reduce the volume of disposal. Not only can the oil and gas industry look forward to reduced water management costs, but environmental impacts will have been reduced; a win-win for all concerned. Accordingly, the industry is increasingly recycling its produced and frack flowback waters for use in water flooding, cyclic steam stimulation, enhanced oil recovery, new hydraulic fracturing operations, irrigation and even drinking water. Recycling is becoming the economic choice as technologies have advanced and the cost of water treatment has decreased; while at the same time, the cost of disposal has risen (according to Shale Play Water Management magazine, costing between $1.75 and $26.75 per barrel of water). In addition, intense lobbying by environmental groups in front-line regions like California and New York is driving treatment and reuse as a way to make fracking and drilling in general more acceptable, especially in the midst of California’s historic drought. Markets-and-markets reports that the global produced water treatment market size is estimated to exceed $8 billion by 2019. The major factors responsible driving the growth of this market include the energy sector growth in Africa and the Middle East, along with increasing strictness of environmental policies. According to Bluefield Research, wastewater treatment spending for hydraulic fracturing is expected to grow almost three-fold, from $138 million in 2014 to $357 million in 2020 in the U.S. Bluefield cites water supplies increasingly at risk, tighter regulations emerging in key states, and costs of disposal on the rise as factors contributing to the substantial rise in water treatment and reuse, which is expected to account for 27 percent of total produced and flowback water by 2020, about double current levels.
Competing Technologies
 
These “filtering” technologies range from simple decanting to distillation. They are typically implemented as a multi-stage process to attain water quality standards for the planned reuse. EWS can act as a pre-treatment stage for any of these multi-stage processes. While EWS can remove the emulsified and free oil, suspended solids and bacteria from the water stream, these subsequent stages can remove the heavy metals, scaling chemicals, salts and other natural and introduced chemicals. EWS can reduce fouling of these filters and membranes, making subsequent or downstream processes complementary to EWS and creating a strategic opportunity to collaborate. Direct competitors using some form of electro-coagulation technologies include: Halliburton, Watertectonics, Bosque, Ecolotron, Quantum-ionics, Kaselco, Baker Hughes, RecylClean, Axine Water and Ecosphere. Other companies also compete with EWS, but use other technologies that can involve chemical coagulants, batch operation or a high level of consumables. These include: Aqua-Tech, Aqua-Pure, CTI, Purifics, HydroZonics, Myclex, Osmonics, Filterboxx, MECO, Layne, 212 Resources, Veolia, Fountain Quail, Pall and Altela.
The Waste Industry
 
Waste water is a growing problem as industry, agriculture and communities expand, droughts force the need for reclamation, and aquifers and reservoirs become polluted. Meanwhile, previously lightly-regulated regions of the world are enforcing much stricter environmental regulations. Overall, water security is one of the greatest challenges of our time. According to analysts at McKinsey & Company (Charting our Water Future, November 2009 report), the world will see a 40 percent gap between water supply and demand by 2030. Industrial uses account for a startling amount of water consumed around the world. According to the United Nations (The World Business Council for Sustainable Development, March 2006 report) industry consumes nearly 60 percent of available water in high-income countries. Curbing fresh water consumption at the industrial level has the potential to significantly improve water security worldwide. In general, we believe that OriginClear has one or more advantages over some of the potential competitors, in that our process does not primarily use chemicals, is highly scalable on a continuous flow process, and may be significantly lower in energy consumption. We believe our technology may, in some cases, complement these companies’ offerings, however there is no guarantee that our technology will produce more efficiently or cost-effectively than these other technologies. To our knowledge, there is no company or technology available on the market providing a similar level of synergistic integration of the three processes that we implement under a single configuration: Electro Coagulation, Electro Flotation (these two being combined in our process as EWS) and Advanced Oxidation (AOx).

Taken separately, these processes are marketed as follows:
 
Electro Coagulation, though being a relatively new technology, has been known and available in the market for approximately 30 years. Companies like Watertectonics, Kaselco, Powel Water or H2O Technologies offer engineered electrocoagulation systems to the market. There are also a number of one-off electrocoagulation systems in operation worldwide. Electro Flotation is an emerging technology that is mostly seen in scientific publications, as an alternative to more conventional Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) systems. DAF systems are available worldwide from numerous suppliers including but not limited to, Veolia Water, Ecologix, RWL Water, SAWater, WPL International, World Water Works, etc. and almost exclusively rely on massive injection of chemical coagulants for their efficiency. EWS has been designed with versatility in mind. It is equally efficient when used with sacrificial anodes, slowly releasing the anode’s metal ions that will provide the coagulation effect, or with Dynamically Stable Anodes (DSA) that will have a catalytic role on water matrix preparation with or without chemical coagulants. In both cases, the patented reactors design marks a significant evolution in the industry, featuring an enhanced mixing function, a better mass transfer and an easier maintenance and replacement when using sacrificial anodes.
 
Advanced Oxidation, not unlike Electro Coagulation, has been known to scientists for approximately 40 years. However, the few Advanced Oxidation technologies being commercially in use mostly rely on catalyst injection and/or on a combination of catalysts and UV irradiation for their process. They are not as streamlined as EWS:AOx, which is solely an electrochemical process, and these processes require extensive preparation of the water matrix to be efficient. MIOX, Blue Earth Labs are marketing similar systems for niche applications, without offering the additional suspended solids removal functions featured by EWS. Other identified competitors are Lenntech, SSWM, Esco International, and Spartan Water Treatment. Here again, OriginClear’s reactors’ specific design is a major evolution. Contact area, mass transfer, high turbulence caused by shear stress all help in enhancing oxidation reactions and, furthermore, the two variations of the tubular reactor design respectively have a major role in direct oxidation, mostly targeting “Hard COD”, contaminants that are known for being difficult to degrade, and, additionally, indirect oxidation, widely used for less difficult reactions.
 
In summary, while competitors exist for each of the three phases of our technology, we have not detected any that does all three in one synergistic system.
 
The Payment Industry


The use of capital for water treatment projects, and the optimization of the water industry using DLT and the blockchain are still very early concepts. We are aware of blockchain initiatives relating narrowly to water rights and water sensing devices; and the H2O ICO “ticker” is for HydroMiner, “a crypto currency mining company using green energy drawn from hydro power stations in the Alpine region of Europe.” None of these are in the same category as WaterChain.
 
In short, we are not aware of any other effort to develop capital for full water systems, nor to create efficiencies for the water industry as a whole using distributed applications on or off blockchain.
 
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
We are not aware of any existing or probable government regulations that would negatively impact on our operations. As a licensor and/or provider of water treatment equipment, we are not subject to government regulations for the removal of oils, solids and pathogens from water, other than normal safety standards and certifications (such as UL or CE) for goods that we manufacture for demonstrations and joint ventures, and our product lines. However, our prospective customers are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. To date, our compliance with government regulations has had no material effect on our operations, capital, earnings, or competitive position, and the cost of such compliance has not been material. We are unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional regulations or legislation could have on our activities.

Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we invested $197,119 and $502,209, respectively, on research and development of our technologies. Research and development costs include activities related to development and innovations in the core EWS technology, fabrication and scale-up of products based on this technology, development of firmware and process automation, development of new applications in industries such as aquaculture, technical support of customers, agents, joint venture partners and licensees, on-site consulting and training activities, and miscellaneous research.


In one outcome of this investment, OriginClear enhanced its Electro Water Separation technology by pairing it with Advanced Oxidation, for which we filed a patent in the 2nd Quarter of 2016.
 
OriginClear’s Advanced Oxidation is a patent-pending, chemical-free way to extract dissolved contaminants, such as bacteria, ammonia, pharmaceuticals and solvents. This complements the EWS technology, which effectively clarifies very dirty, oily water so that membranes and filters can do their job without clogging.
 
Employees
 
As of April 15, 2018, we have 22 full-time employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
