Item 1. Business
Legal Organization
National General Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation, is a specialty personal lines insurance holding company. References to “National General,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other statements and information publicly disseminated by National General Holdings Corp. refer to National General Holdings Corp. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise.
Business Overview
We are a specialty personal lines insurance holding company that, through our subsidiaries, provides a variety of insurance products, including personal and small business automobile, homeowners, umbrella, recreational vehicle, motorcycle, lender-placed, supplemental health and other niche insurance products. We sell insurance products with a focus on underwriting profitability through a combination of our customized and predictive analytics and our technology driven low cost infrastructure.
Our automobile insurance products protect our customers against losses due to physical damage to their motor vehicles, bodily injury and liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising from auto accidents. Our homeowners and umbrella insurance products protect our customers against losses to dwellings and their contents from a variety of perils, as well as coverage for personal liability. We offer our property and casualty (“P&C”) insurance products through a network of approximately 31,270 independent agents, a number of affinity partners and through direct-response marketing programs and retail storefronts. We have approximately 4.1 million P&C policyholders.
Our accident and health (“A&H”) business provides accident and health insurance products not subject to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) and targets uninsured or underinsured individuals and employers who are interested in an alternative to PPACA-compliant major medical coverage or who are looking for supplemental insurance options to help cover out of pocket costs. We market our and other carriers’ A&H insurance products through a multi-pronged distribution platform that includes a network of over 49,900 independent agents, our in-house agencies, direct-to-consumer marketing, wholesaling, worksite marketing and the internet.
We are licensed to operate in 50 states and the District of Columbia, but focus on niche markets. Approximately 76.1% of our P&C premium written is originated in ten core states: North Carolina, California, New York, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Virginia, Louisiana, Michigan and Alabama.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our gross premium written was $5,417 million, $4,756 million and $3,501 million, net premium written was $3,828 million, $3,578 million and $3,073 million and total consolidated revenues were $4,608 million, $4,422 million and $3,569 million, respectively.
Our company was formed in 2009 to acquire the private passenger auto business of the U.S. consumer property and casualty insurance segment of General Motors Acceptance Corporation (“GMAC,” now known as Ally Financial Inc.), which operations date back to 1939. We acquired this business on March 1, 2010.
Our wholly-owned subsidiaries include twenty-one regulated domestic insurance companies, of which nineteen write primarily P&C insurance and two write A&H insurance. Our insurance subsidiaries have an “A-” (Excellent) rating by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”). We currently conduct a limited amount of business outside the United States, primarily in Bermuda and Sweden.
Two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries that we acquired in 2014 are management companies that act as attorneys-in-fact for Adirondack Insurance Exchange, a New York reciprocal insurer, and New Jersey Skylands Insurance Association, a New Jersey reciprocal insurer (together, the “Reciprocal Exchanges” or “Exchanges”). We do not own the Reciprocal Exchanges but are paid a fee to manage their business operations through our wholly-owned management companies.
Business Segments
We are a specialty national carrier with regional focuses. We manage our business through two segments:

• | Property and Casualty - Our P&C segment operates its business through three primary distribution channels: agency, affinity and direct. Our agency channel focuses primarily on writing standard, preferred and nonstandard auto coverage and homeowners and umbrella coverage through our network of approximately 31,270 independent agents. In our affinity channel, we partner with a number of affinity groups and membership organizations to deliver insurance products tailored to the needs of our affinity partners’ members or customers under our affinity partners’ brand name or label, which we refer to as selling on a “white label” basis. A primary focus of a number of our affinity relationships is providing recreational vehicle coverage, of which we believe we are one of the top writers in the U.S. Our direct channel is operated through approximately 460 store fronts, web/mobile, phone sales centers and kiosks. In addition, we operate our lender-placed services through long-term distribution agreements with certain mortgage lenders.


• | Accident and Health - Our A&H segment provides accident and non-major medical health insurance products targeting our existing policyholders and uninsured or underinsured individuals. Through a number of acquisitions of both carriers and general agencies, including VelaPoint, LLC, our call center general agency (“Velapoint”), National Health Insurance Company, a life and health insurance carrier (“NHIC”), Euro Accident Health & Care Insurance Aktiebolag, our European group life and health insurance managing general agent (“EHC”), Quotit Corporation, an application service provider for health insurance, HealthCompare Insurance Services, Inc., a call center agency, Healthcare Solutions Team, LLC, a healthcare insurance managing general agency (“HST”), and North Star Marketing Corporation, a proprietary small group sales channel, we have assembled a multi-pronged distribution platform that includes direct-to-consumer marketing through our call center agency, selling through approximately 49,900 independent agents, wholesaling insurance products through large general agencies/program managers and, through our affinity relationships, worksite marketing through employers and the internet.

P&C Segment
Distribution and Marketing
Agency Distribution Channel
Our agency channel focuses on writing automobile insurance, including standard, preferred and nonstandard insurance, as well as preferred homeowners and umbrella insurance, through independent insurance agents and brokers. We have established a broad geographic presence throughout the United States and have a significant market presence in our ten largest states, namely North Carolina, California, New York, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Virginia, Louisiana, Michigan and Alabama.
Relationships with our Independent Agents. We have built a strong network of approximately 31,270 independent insurance agents and brokers and provide them with competitive compensation, a user-friendly technology platform and superior service. In order to provide quick and responsive service to our agents, we operate an agency customer service call center staffed by experienced and highly-trained employees. Our focus on building and maintaining a strong agency network has created an effective variable cost distribution platform and is integral to the long-term success of our agency channel.
Our North Carolina Business. We are the largest writer of nonstandard auto insurance sold through independent agents in North Carolina, with over 50% market share. For the year ended December 31, 2018, in North Carolina, we generated $729.4 million of gross premium written.
The North Carolina nonstandard auto insurance market is serviced by a small number of carriers with most liability insurance ceded to the state-controlled North Carolina Reinsurance Facility, the NCRF. We are not subject to any underwriting liability risk on the NCRF business written because losses are incurred by the NCRF. As a servicing carrier 
3

to the state facility, we receive a ceding commission from the NCRF to help offset operating expenses for providing the coverage to North Carolina residents.
Affinity Distribution Channel
Through the affinity distribution channel of our P&C insurance business we are a leader in affinity marketing and have been in operation since 1953, relying on best-in-class marketing strategies and analytics to maximize the value of our longstanding relationships. Our affinity relationships are generally long-term in nature. In general, an affinity partner relationship consists of a partnership agreement between a sponsoring organization and an insurance company entered into to address the specific insurance needs of the sponsor organization’s members or customers. Through the affinity relationship, the insurance company receives an endorsement that positions it favorably among the sponsoring organizations’ members or customers. In exchange for the endorsement, the affinity customer receives access to a quality insurer, advantageous pricing and customized products. A primary focus of our affinity channel is to provide recreational vehicle, or RV, insurance, of which we believe we are one of the largest writers in the U.S.
Direct Distribution Channel
Through our acquisition of Direct General Corporation (“Direct General”) in 2016, we obtained a direct distribution channel that primarily sells nonstandard auto policies. Our direct channel includes approximately 460 retail store fronts, web/mobile capabilities, phone contact centers and kiosks. The diversity of the channel supports growth through changing customer preferences, and gives National General a foothold in the industry’s fastest growing channel. Local retail stores placed in high traffic areas are central to the omni-channel strategy, and are a key component to the marketing and brand awareness efforts in our direct distribution channel. The omni-channel approach also creates a seamless customer experience, regardless of the channel or device that is used.
Lender-placed Insurance Business
We offer lender-placed insurance products and related services to mortgage lenders and servicers (“LPI Business”).
P&C Product Overview
In our P&C segment, we operate in niche businesses and offer a broad range of products employing multiple channels of distribution. Through our agency channel, we primarily sell nonstandard automobile insurance through independent agents and brokers and also offer standard and preferred auto, motorcycle, small business vehicle, homeowners and umbrella products. Through our affinity channel, we primarily underwrite and market standard and preferred auto and RV insurance.

• | Standard and preferred automobile insurance. These policies provide coverage designed for drivers with greater financial resources and a less risky driving and claims history and have higher renewal retention than nonstandard policies.


• | Nonstandard automobile insurance. These policies provide coverage for liability and physical damage and are designed for drivers who represent a higher-than-normal level of risk as a result of several factors, including their driving record, limited driving experience and claims history, among other factors, and consequently their premiums are generally higher than those for drivers who qualify for standard or preferred coverage.


• | Homeowners insurance. Our homeowners policies are generally multiple-peril policies, providing property and liability coverages for one- and two-family, owner-occupied residences. We also offer additional personal umbrella coverage to the homeowner.


• | Recreational vehicle insurance. Unlike many of our competitors, our policies carry RV-specific endorsements tailored to these vehicles, including automatic personal effects coverage, optional replacement cost coverage, RV storage coverage and full-time liability coverage. We also bundle coverage for RVs and passenger cars in a single policy for which the customer is billed on a combined statement.


• | Small business automobile insurance. These policies include liability and physical damage coverage for light-to-medium duty commercial vehicles, focused on artisan vehicles, with an average of two vehicles per policy.


• | Motorcycle insurance. We provide coverage for most types of motorcycles, as well as golf carts and all-terrain vehicles. Our policy coverage offers flexibility to permit the customer to select the type (e.g., liability) and limit of insurance (e.g., $100,000/$250,000/$500,000), and to include other risks, such as add-on equipment and towing.


• | Lender-placed insurance. Through the lender-placed insurance platform, we offer a full suite of lender-placed insurance products to customers, including fire, home and flood products, as well as collateral protection insurance and guaranteed asset protection products for automobiles.

Fee Income
In addition to traditional insurance premiums, we generate revenue by charging policy service fees to policyholders. These fees include service fees for installment or renewal policies and fees for insufficient funds, late payments, cancellations and various financial responsibility filing fees. The fee income we generate varies depending on the type of policy and state regulations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our P&C segment generated $375.6 million in revenue from policy service fees.
P&C Gross Premium Written by State
We are licensed to operate in 50 states and the District of Columbia. For the year ended December 31, 2018 our top ten states represented 76.1% of our gross premium written. The following table sets forth the distribution of our P&C gross premium written by state as a percent of total gross premium written:

 | Year Ended December 31,

Underwriting and Claims Management Philosophy
We believe that proactive and prompt claims management is essential to reducing losses and lowering loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) and enables us to more effectively and accurately measure reserves. To this end, we utilize our technology and extensive database of loss history in order to appropriately price and structure policies, maintain lower levels of loss, enhance our ability to accurately predict losses, and maintain lower claims costs. We believe that a strong underwriting foundation is best accomplished through careful risk selection and continuous evaluation of underwriting guidelines relative to loss experience. We are committed to a consistent and thorough review of new underwriting opportunities as well as our portfolio and product mix as a whole.
Underwriting, Pricing and Risk Management, and Actuarial Capabilities
We establish premium rates for insurance products based upon an analysis of expected losses using historical experience and anticipated future trends. Our product team develops the product and manages our underwriting tolerances. By utilizing a detailed actuarial analysis our actuarial team establishes the necessary rate level for a given product and territory to achieve our targeted return. For risks which fall within our underwriting tolerances, we establish a price by matching a rate to a risk at a detailed level of segmentation. We determine the individual risk using predictive modeling developed by our analytics team with a level of precision that we believe is superior to the traditional loss cost pricing used by many of our competitors. We believe that effective collaboration among the product, analytics and actuarial teams enhances our ability to price risks appropriately and achieve our targeted rates of return.
Our actuarial group is central to the pricing and risk management process. The group carries out a number of functions including developing, tracking, and reporting on accident year loss results, monitoring and addressing national, state and channel-specific profit trends and establishing actuarial rate level needs and indications. Our actuarial group also helps ensure the integrity of reported accident year results.
To assist us in profitably underwriting our P&C products, our predictive analytics team has developed our RAD underwriting pricing tool. The RAD underwriting pricing tool offers significant advantages over our prior pricing tools by employing numerous additional components and pricing strategies such as supplemental risk and improved credit modeling. We believe the RAD underwriting pricing tool facilitates better pricing over the lifetime of a policy by employing lifetime value modeling, elasticity modeling and optimized pricing. We believe that our RAD underwriting pricing tool provides us with competitive advantage for pricing our products relative to other auto insurers of our size.
Claims
Claims can be submitted by telephone, email or smartphone app by policyholders, producers or other parties directly to our claims department. Upon notification of a claim, our claims call center creates a loss notice based on policy information in our claims system, EPIC. The claim is then automatically assigned to a claim handler and to a field adjuster for a vehicle inspection, if necessary. An initial reserve is established based on the type and location of the exposure and data from actuarial tables. A notice to the adjuster is automatically generated immediately after a claim has been assigned. The claim handler’s manager receives a status assignment within 24 hours to ensure the claim is being investigated in a timely manner. The claim handler evaluates coverage and loss participants and investigates the loss. If the claim represents a loss exceeding $50,000, the claim handler will establish a case-specific reserve based on the potential exposure. Claims with potential losses exceeding $100,000 are referred to the large loss unit and handled by employees specially trained to handle these claims. Every claims employee is granted authority to reserve and pay up to a specified claim level. If the potential claim amount exceeds the employee’s authority level, the request is automatically forwarded through EPIC to the manager with the appropriate authority level. As part of the investigation, claim handlers contact the parties to the loss and complete their investigations. Claim handlers record all investigation activities in EPIC, which are reviewed periodically by the managers in the department to ensure proper claims handling. Once the claim investigation has been completed, the claim handler works to close the claim as soon as possible. As of December 31, 2018, our Claims department includes approximately 2,580 individuals.
We carefully monitor our claim performance to ensure efficient handling. Management teams perform weekly reviews of open and aged claim reports. Through a combination of peer reviews, supervisor audits and monthly management information system reports, we have established an efficient mechanism designed to maintain and improve our level of claim handling performance.
Competition
The property and casualty insurance market in the United States is highly competitive. We believe that our primary competition comes not only from national companies or their subsidiaries, such as The Progressive Corporation, The Allstate Corporation, The Travelers Companies, Inc., The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc., Selective Insurance Group, Inc., State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, Farmers Insurance Group, Assurant, Inc. and GEICO, but also from nonstandard auto focused insurers such as Mercury General Corporation, Kemper Corporation and independent agents that operate in a specific region or single state in which we operate. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Insurance Operations - The insurance industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively against larger companies.”
We rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential. We have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills, closely managing expenses, and achieving operating efficiencies. Superior customer service and fair and accurate claims adjusting are also important factors in our competitive strategy. With our policy administration system and our advanced underwriting pricing tools, we believe we will continue to operate well in the competitive environment.
P&C Acquisitions
Since we acquired our P&C insurance business, we have made several acquisitions and entered into a number of renewal rights transactions. These additional operations have increased our presence in our target markets and broadened our distribution capabilities. We believe that merger and acquisition transactions and their effective integration represent a core competency and provide continued growth opportunities. For details of the impact of these acquisitions in our results of operations, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations.”
Quota Share Reinsurance
Effective July 1, 2017, we entered into an auto quota share agreement, pursuant to which we cede 15.0% of net liability under our auto policies to an unaffiliated third-party reinsurance provider. Under the auto quota share agreement, we retain the flexibility, under certain conditions, to increase the cession percentage up to a maximum cession of 30.0% and to decrease the cession percentage to a minimum cession of 10.0% during 2018 and 5.0% during 2019. Effective January 1, 2019, we cede 7.0% of net liability under new and renewal auto policies written on or after January 1, 2019.
Effective July 1, 2017, we entered into a homeowners quota share agreement, pursuant to which we ceded 29.6% of net liability under homeowners policies to unaffiliated third-party reinsurance providers. Under the homeowners quota share agreement, effective May 1, 2018, the Company cedes an additional 12.4% of net liability (for a total cession of 42.0%) and receives a 38.0% ceding commission on the additional 12.4% in ceded premiums. See Note 10, “Reinsurance” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
A&H Segment
Our A&H segment provides supplemental accident and health insurance products. One of the keys to our overall strategy revolves around distribution. We have multiple ways to reach the consumer through established channels, including:

• | directly to the consumer through our in-house general agency;


• | through independent agents;


• | wholesaling through other general agents and Managing General Underwriters (“MGUs”); and


• | through employers in the worksite.

We believe that our A&H distribution is unique because it is not driven by “company stores” - outlets that only sell products underwritten by us. In the markets where we choose not to underwrite, such as traditional individual and group fully insured major medical, we still sell these products on behalf of third-party carriers, allowing us to match 
consumers’ needs, whether it’s a product underwritten by us or a third-party carrier. This one-stop shopping element makes our distribution outlets attractive for both consumers and agents and enables us to promote our supplemental/ancillary products in a single sale environment.
Our product focus in our A&H segment is offering economical and quality alternatives to the traditional group and individual insurance markets. A significant portion of the market has challenges in obtaining health insurance that balances depth of coverage with affordability. We believe we are uniquely positioned to offer greater value to our consumers because of our far-reaching distribution and focused product portfolio.
Our products fall into three broad categories: (1) supplemental/ancillary healthcare policies that mitigate exposure to high out-of-pocket costs with some major medical policies; (2) specialty accident policies and short term individual major medical policies specifically not subject to the PPACA for consumers seeking an alternative to more traditional forms of major medical insurance; and (3) self-insurance programs for small employers to assist employers who find self-insurance to be a more cost effective solution to the group healthcare needs.
A&H Product Overview
We focus on products that help individuals and employers address the ever increasing affordability challenges in healthcare. Our products include those packaged with other coverages or services to enhance the overall value proposition to the consumer, as well as standalone products. Target products for groups (through employers) and individuals include:

• | Accident/AD&D. This coverage pays a stated benefit to the insured or his/her beneficiary in the event of bodily injury or death due to accidental means (other than natural causes). These policies can serve as supplemental policies underneath high deductible major medical plans that help reduce out of pocket expenses for consumers that result from unexpected events.


• | Hospital Indemnity. These plans provide a fixed benefit amount for specific healthcare services (e.g. office visits, hospital stays, diagnostic care, etc.) with no deductibles or copays. They are designed for individuals who are looking for coverage that reduces out of pocket costs not covered by major medical coverage.


• | Short-Term Medical. These plans can bridge the timing gap between the annual open enrollment periods (when traditional major medical insurance is available), and offers individuals financial protection for certain unexpected medical bills and other health care expenses (e.g. office visits, emergency, care, hospital stays, etc.). These plans have prescribed policy durations; typically durations cannot exceed 12 months and in many states cannot exceed three months.


• | Cancer/Critical Illness. Critical illness policies provide benefits when specific diseases are first diagnosed. These benefits are paid to the individual directly, who can use them to pay for other out of pocket costs that may arise. This coverage can be sold on a guarantee and simplified issue (health questionnaire) basis either as a standalone product or packaged with other products.


• | Stop Loss. Increases in health insurance costs in the group fully insured market has caused an increase in the number of employers offering self-insured plans. NHIC offers a wide array of stop loss programs together with self-insured program administration for small and large employers, as permitted by state law.


• | Dental. These policies provide basic dental coverage and can be sold on a stand-alone basis or packaged with other products. They are frequently matched with discount plans and/or dental networks.

Ratings
Financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and are important to our ability to market and sell our products. Rating organizations continually review the financial positions of insurers, including us. A.M. Best has currently assigned our insurance subsidiaries a rating of “A-” (Excellent). According to A.M. Best, “A-” ratings are assigned to insurers that have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing financial obligations to policyholders. This rating reflects A.M. Best’s opinion of our ability to pay claims and is not an evaluation directed to investors regarding an investment in our common stock. This rating is subject to periodic review by, and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of, A.M. Best. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Future changes to our rating may adversely affect our competitive 
position. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Business - A downgrade in the A.M. Best rating of our insurance subsidiaries would likely reduce the amount of business we are able to write and could materially adversely impact the competitive positions of our insurance subsidiaries.”
Loss Reserves
We record loss reserves for estimated losses under the insurance policies that we write and for LAE related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims. Our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances.
The process of establishing the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is complex and imprecise as it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events. As a result, informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an important component of our loss reserving process.
Loss reserves include statistical reserves and case estimates for individual claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims, less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as economic, legal and social conditions. Loss reserves, except life reserves, are not discounted to present value, which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income.
Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses. Reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves. The IBNR reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported, some of which are not yet known to the insured, as well as a provision for future development on reported claims.
We regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of actuarial methods and available information. We update the reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled or as new information becomes available. Any changes in estimates are reflected in financial results in the period in which the estimates are changed.
Our actuarial review may include an actual to expected loss analysis or more detailed reserve indications for segments with changes, as well as the actuary’s reasonable reserve range compared to carried reserves. We review available actuarial indications and review carried reserves compared to the reasonable reserve range to determine whether any reserve adjustments are warranted.
Our internal actuarial analysis of the historical data provides the factors we use in our actuarial analysis in estimating our loss and LAE reserves. These factors are implicit measures over time of claims reported, average case incurred amounts, case development, severity and payment patterns. However, these factors cannot be directly used as they do not take into consideration changes in business mix, claims management, regulatory issues, medical trends, and other subjective factors. We generally use a combination of actuarial factors and subjective assumptions in the development of up to seven of the following actuarial methodologies:

• | Paid Development Method - uses historical, cumulative paid losses by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years.


• | Paid Generalized Cape Cod Method - combines the Paid Development Method with the expected loss method, where the expected loss ratios are estimated from exposure and claims experience weighted across multiple accident periods. The selected expected loss ratio for a given accident year is derived by giving some weight to all of the accident years in the experience history rather than treating each accident year independently.


• | Paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method - a combination of the Paid Development Method and the Expected Loss Method, the Paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method estimates ultimate losses by adding actual paid losses and projected future unpaid losses. The amounts produced are then added to cumulative paid losses to produce the final estimates of ultimate incurred losses.


• | Incurred Development Method - uses historical, cumulative incurred losses by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years.


• | Incurred Generalized Cape Cod Method - combines the Incurred Development Method with the expected loss method, where the expected loss ratios are estimated from exposure and claims experience weighted across multiple accident periods. The selected expected loss ratio for a given accident year is derived by giving some weight to all of the accident years in the experience history rather than treating each accident year independently.


• | Incurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method - a combination of the Incurred Development Method and the Expected Loss Method, the Incurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method estimates ultimate losses by adding actual incurred losses and projected future unreported losses. The amounts produced are then added to cumulative incurred losses to produce an estimate of ultimate incurred losses.


• | Expected Loss Method - utilizes an expected ultimate loss ratio based on historical experience adjusted for trends multiplied by earned premium to project ultimate losses.

For each method, losses are projected to the ultimate amount to be paid. We then analyze the results and may emphasize or deemphasize some or all of the outcomes to reflect actuarial judgment regarding their reasonableness in relation to supplementary information and operational and industry changes. These outcomes are then aggregated to produce a single selected point estimate that is the basis for the internal actuary’s point estimate for loss reserves.
In determining the level of emphasis that may be placed on some or all of the methods, internal actuaries periodically review statistical information as to which methods are most appropriate, whether adjustments are appropriate within the particular methods, and if results produced by each method include inherent bias reflecting operational and industry changes.
This supplementary information may include:

• | open and closed claim counts;


• | statistics related to open and closed claim count percentages;


• | claim closure rates;


• | changes in average case reserves and average loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred on open claims;


• | reported and ultimate average case incurred changes;


• | reported and projected ultimate loss ratios; and


• | loss payment patterns.

When reviewing reserves, we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of numerous factors such as (1) individual claim information; (2) industry and the historical loss experience; (3) legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in the imposition of damages, and changes in political attitudes; and (4) trends in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. This process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future events. There is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves, because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors. The key assumptions we use in our determination of appropriate reserve levels include the underlying actuarial methodologies, consideration of pricing and underwriting initiatives, an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels, and consideration of any claims handling impact on paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods.
With respect to estimating ultimate losses and LAE, the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and our approach in establishing such assumptions remained consistent for newly underwritten lines. If circumstances bear out our assumptions, losses incurred in 2018 should develop similarly to losses incurred in 2017 and prior years. Thus, if for example, the net loss ratio for auto insurance premiums written in a given accident year is 65.0%, we expect that the net loss ratio for auto insurance premiums written in that same accident year 
evolving in Year 2 would also be 65.0%. However, due to the inherent uncertainty in the loss development factors, our actual liabilities may differ significantly from our original estimates.

We rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to evaluate and price our products accurately according to risk exposure. In order to provide our policyholders and producers with superior service and realize profitable growth, we have substantially upgraded our information technology capabilities in recent years. In September 2017, we acquired ownership of our personal lines policy administration system (“NPS”) and the related intellectual property from AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (“AmTrust”), which we previously licensed from them for a licensing fee, for a purchase price of $200 million. The purchase price is payable in three equal payments, with the first payment made upon the execution of the agreement, the second payment made upon the 6-month anniversary of the agreement, and the third payment payable upon the later of the completion of the full separation and transfer of the NPS to our operating environment and the 18-month anniversary of the agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement. NPS is based on advanced server-based technology allowing quicker processing and the ability for enhanced scalability. This system reduced cost by eliminating our three costly legacy mainframe based systems and allows for increased straight-through automated processing, removing the need for expensive back office processes as well as providing enhanced self-service functionality. Since inception, we have reduced our information technology operating expenses significantly. Our goal is to continue to make strategic investments in technology in order to develop sophisticated tools that enhance our customer service, product management and data analysis capabilities.
Our RAD underwriting pricing tool accurately prices specific risk exposures to assist us in profitably underwriting our P&C products. Our RAD technology offers significant advantages over our prior underwriting pricing system by employing numerous additional components and pricing strategies such as supplemental risk and improved credit modeling. We believe the RAD underwriting pricing tool will facilitate better pricing over the lifetime of a policy by employing lifetime value modeling, elasticity modeling and optimized pricing.
In our lender-placed insurance business, we use a proprietary insurance-tracking system to monitor the customers’ mortgage portfolios to verify the continuation of insurance coverage on each mortgaged property. We believe we can leverage our technology expertise to operate the business under a more efficient cost structure.
Regulation
General
We are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and to a lesser extent in Bermuda and Sweden. As of December 31, 2018, we had twenty-one operating insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the United States: Integon Casualty Insurance Company, Integon General Insurance Corporation, Integon Indemnity Corporation, Integon National Insurance Company (“Integon National”), Integon Preferred Insurance Company, New South Insurance Company, MIC General Insurance Corporation, National General Insurance Company, National General Assurance Company, National General Insurance Online, Inc., National Health Insurance Company, National General Premier Insurance Company, Imperial Fire and Casualty Insurance Company, Agent Alliance Insurance Company, Century-National Insurance Company, Standard Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Direct General Insurance Company, Direct General Insurance Company of Mississippi, Direct General Life Insurance Company, Direct Insurance Company and Direct National Insurance Company. Our insurance subsidiaries have an “A-” (Excellent) group rating by A.M. Best. We currently conduct a limited amount of business outside the United States, primarily in Bermuda and Sweden.
State Insurance Regulation
Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the jurisdiction in which they are domiciled and, to a lesser extent, other jurisdictions in which they are authorized to conduct business. 
The primary purpose of such regulatory powers is to protect individual policyholders. State insurance authorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers, including, among other things, the power to (a) grant and revoke licenses to transact business, including individual lines of authority, (b) set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained, (c) determine the nature of, and limitations on, investments and dividends, (d) approve policy rules, rates and forms prior to issuance, (e) regulate and conduct specific examinations regarding marketing, unfair trade, claims and fraud prevention and investigation practices, and (f) conduct periodic comprehensive examinations of the financial condition of insurance companies domiciled in their state.
Financial Oversight
Reporting Requirements
Our insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles and other reports with the departments of insurance in all states in which they are licensed to transact business. These reports include details concerning claims reserves held by the insurer, specific investments held by the insurer, and numerous other disclosures about the insurer’s financial condition and operations. These financial statements are subject to periodic examination by the department of insurance in each state in which they are filed.
Investments
State insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make. Limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer, as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments. Certain investments (such as real estate) are prohibited by certain jurisdictions.
Each of our domiciliary states has its own regulations and limitations on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer and the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments. In general, investments may not exceed a certain percentage of surplus, admitted assets or total investments. For example, the investments of Integon National, domiciled in North Carolina, in stocks shall not exceed twenty-five percent of Integon National’s admitted assets and the stock of any one corporation may not exceed three percent of its admitted assets. To ensure compliance in each state, we review our investment portfolio quarterly based on each states regulations and limitations.
State Insurance Department Examinations
As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed financial examinations of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). A second type of regulatory oversight examination of insurance companies involves a review by an insurance department of an authorized company’s market conduct, which entails a review and examination of a company’s compliance with laws governing marketing, underwriting, rating, policy-issuance, claims-handling and other aspects of its insurance business during a specified period of time.
The results of these examinations can give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive or other corrective action on the part of the company that is the subject of the examination or assessing fines or other penalties against that company.
Risk-Based Capital Regulations
Our insurance subsidiaries are required to report their risk-based capital based on a formula developed and adopted by the NAIC that attempts to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in the insurer’s mix of products and investment portfolio. The formula is designed to allow insurance regulators to identify weakly-capitalized companies. Under the formula, a company determines its “risk-based capital” by taking into account certain risks related to the insurer’s assets (including risks related to its investment portfolio and ceded reinsurance) and the insurer’s 
liabilities (including underwriting risks related to the nature and experience of its insurance business). The departments of insurance in our domiciliary states generally require a minimum total adjusted risk-based capital equal to 200% of an insurance company’s authorized control level risk-based capital. Each of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted risk-based capital substantially in excess of 200% of the authorized control level as of December 31, 2018.
Insurance Regulatory Information System Ratios
The NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, is part of a collection of analytical tools designed to provide state insurance regulators with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS is intended to assist state insurance regulators in targeting resources to those insurers in greatest need of regulatory attention. IRIS consists of two phases: statistical and analytical. In the statistical phase, the NAIC database generates key financial ratio results based on financial information obtained from insurers’ annual statutory statements. The analytical phase is a review of the annual statements, financial ratios and other automated solvency tools. The primary goal of the analytical phase is to identify companies that appear to require immediate regulatory attention. A ratio result falling outside the usual range of IRIS ratios is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. An insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are in themselves immaterial or because of certain reinsurance or pooling structures or changes in such structures.
Management does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of the 2018 IRIS ratio results for our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries. In all instances in prior years, regulators have been satisfied upon any follow-up that no regulatory action was required.
Statutory Accounting Principles
Statutory accounting principles, or SAP, are a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer’s solvency. Statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer’s domiciliary state.
Generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, like SAP, is concerned with a company’s solvency, but it is also concerned with other financial measurements, principally income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriately matching revenue and expenses and accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as compared to SAP.
Credit for Reinsurance
State insurance laws permit U.S. insurance companies, as ceding insurers, to take financial statement credit for reinsurance that is ceded, so long as the assuming reinsurer satisfies the state’s credit for reinsurance laws. The Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act (“NRRA”) contained in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) provides that if the state of domicile of a ceding insurer is an NAIC accredited state, or has financial solvency requirements substantially similar to the requirements necessary for NAIC accreditation, and recognizes credit for reinsurance for the insurer’s ceded risk, then no other state may deny such credit for reinsurance. Because all states are currently accredited by the NAIC, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits a state in which a U.S. ceding insurer is licensed but not domiciled from denying credit for reinsurance for the insurer’s ceded risk if the cedant’s domestic state regulator recognizes credit for reinsurance. The ceding company in this instance is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the ceding company’s liability for unearned premium (which are that portion of premiums written which applies to the unexpired portion of the policy period), loss reserves and loss expense reserves to the extent ceded to the reinsurer.
Holding Company Regulation
We qualify as a holding company system under state-enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. Each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance regulatory agency of its state of domicile and periodically furnish information concerning its operations and transactions, particularly with other companies within the holding company system that may materially affect its operations, management or financial condition.
Transactions with Affiliates
The insurance laws in most of those states provide that all transactions among members of an insurance holding company system must be fair and reasonable. These laws require disclosure of material transactions within the holding company system and, in some cases, prior notice of or approval for certain transactions, including, among other things, (a) the payment of certain dividends, (b) cost sharing agreements, (c) intercompany agency, service or management agreements, (d) acquisition or divestment of control of or merger with domestic insurers, (e) sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, guarantees or investments if such transactions are equal to or exceed certain thresholds, and (f) reinsurance agreements. All transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation.
Dividends
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements as to maintenance of policyholders’ surplus and payment of dividends. In general, the maximum amount of dividends that the insurance subsidiaries may pay in any 12-month period without regulatory approval is the greater of adjusted statutory net income or 10% of statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the preceding calendar year end. Adjusted statutory net income is generally defined for this purpose to be statutory net income, net of realized capital gains, for the calendar year preceding the date of the dividend. Also, most states restrict an insurance company’s ability to pay dividends in excess of its statutory unassigned surplus or earned surplus. In addition, state insurance regulators may limit or restrict an insurance company’s ability to pay stockholder dividends or as a condition to issuance of a certificate of authority, as a condition to a change of control approval or for other regulatory reasons.
Enterprise Risk
The Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation (the “Amended Model Act and Regulation”) adopted by the NAIC imposes more extensive informational requirements on an insurance holding company system in order to protect the licensed insurance companies from enterprise risk, including requiring it to prepare an annual enterprise risk report that identifies the material risks within the insurance company holding system that could pose enterprise risk to the licensed insurer. To date, a number of states have adopted some or all of the changes in the Amended Model Act and Regulation, including states where some of our insurance companies are domiciled or commercially domiciled.
The Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act, adopted by the NAIC, requires insurers to maintain a framework for identifying, assessing, monitoring and reporting on the “material and relevant risks” associated with the insurer’s current business plans. Under the ORSA Model Act, an insurer must perform at least annually a self-assessment of its current and future risks and must file a confidential report with the insurer’s lead insurance regulator. The ORSA report was filed in 2018 with the Company’s lead insurance regulator, as well as with certain other state regulators, and describes our process for assessing our own solvency.
Change of Control
State insurance holding company laws require prior approval by the respective state insurance departments of any change of control of an insurer. “Control” is generally defined as the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the company, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. Control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership 
of 10% or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. Any person wishing to acquire control of us or of any substantial portion of our outstanding shares would first be required to obtain the approval of the domestic regulators (including those asserting “commercial domicile”) of our insurance subsidiaries.
Any future transactions that would constitute a change of control, including a change of control of us and/or any of our domestic insurance subsidiaries, would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the prior approval of the department of insurance in the state in which the insurance company being acquired is domiciled (and in any other state in which the company may be deemed to be commercially domiciled by reason of concentration of its insurance business within such state) and may also require pre-notification in certain other states. Obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of, or deter, any such transaction.
These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.
Market Conduct
Regulation of Insurance Rates and Approval of Policy Forms
The insurance laws of most states in which we conduct business require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval. If, as permitted in some states, we begin using new rates before they are approved, we may be required to issue refunds or credits to the policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair and disapproved by the applicable state regulator. In other states, prior approval of rate changes is required and there may be long delays in the approval process or the rates may not be approved. Accordingly, our ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state can be adversely affected.
Restrictions on Withdrawal, Cancellation, and Nonrenewal
In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or not renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance department may disapprove any proposed plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to exit unprofitable markets.
Required Licensing
Our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by the department of insurance in the states in which they sell insurance. If a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license, our ability to offer new insurance products in that market may be substantially impaired. In addition, if the department of insurance in any state in which one of our insurance subsidiaries currently operates suspends, non-renews, or revokes an existing license, we would not be able to offer affected products in the state.
In addition, insurance agencies, producers, third-party administrators, claims adjusters and service contract providers and administrators are subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states in which they conduct business. Certain of our subsidiaries engage in these functions and are subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states.
Guaranty Fund Assessments
Most, if not all, of the states where we are licensed to transact business require that property and casualty insurers doing business within the state participate in a guaranty association, which is organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by the member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets.
Property and casualty insurance company insolvencies or failures may result in additional guaranty association assessments to our insurance subsidiaries at some future date. At this time, we are unable to determine the impact, if any, that such assessments may have on their financial positions or results of their operations. As of December 31, 2018, each of our insurance subsidiaries has established accruals for guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings.
Assigned Risks
Many states in which we conduct business require automobile liability insurers to sell bodily injury liability, property damage liability, medical expense, and uninsured motorist coverage to a proportionate number (based on the insurer’s share of the state’s automobile casualty insurance market) of those drivers applying for placement as “assigned risks.” Drivers seek placement as assigned risks because their driving records or other relevant characteristics make them difficult to insure in the voluntary market.
Federal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes
From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry. Among the proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures (some of which have been enacted) to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the NAIC.
On December 22, 2017, “H.R.1”, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”) was signed into law. The TCJA reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, which impacted the Company’s effective tax rate and after-tax earnings in the United States. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes, requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates in the year of enactment, which is the year in which the change was signed into law. Accordingly, the Company adjusted its deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017, using the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent. The Company was also affected by certain other aspects of the TCJA, including, without limitation, provisions regarding the one-time transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings and profits, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation and deductibility of capital expenditures.
The Dodd-Frank Act established a Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Federal Insurance Office is charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry (other than health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance), gathering data, and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the United States. In 2013, the FIO issued a report (as required under the Dodd-Frank Act) entitled “How to Modernize and Improve the System of Insurance Regulation in the United States” (the “Report”), which stated that, given the “uneven” progress the states have made with several near-term state reforms, should the states fail to accomplish the necessary modernization reforms in the near term, “Congress should strongly consider direct federal involvement.” The FIO continues to support the current state-based regulatory regime, but will consider federal regulation should the states fail to take steps to greater uniformity (e.g., federal licensing of insurers). The Report also appears to signal greater activity by the federal government in dealing with non-U.S. regulators and regulatory regimes, using the authority expressly given by the Dodd-Frank Act to Treasury and the United States Trade Representative to negotiate “covered agreements” with foreign authorities.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Federal Reserve supervisory authority over a number of financial services companies, including insurance companies, if they are designated by a two-thirds vote of the Financial Stability Oversight Council as “systemically important.” If an insurance company is designated as systemically important, the Federal Reserve’s supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial regulation upon that insurance company and could impact requirements regarding its capital, liquidity and leverage as well as its business and investment conduct.
The Dodd-Frank Act also incorporates the NRRA, which, among other things, establishes national uniform standards on how states may regulate and tax surplus lines insurance and sets national standards concerning the regulation of reinsurance. In particular, the NRRA gives regulators in the home state of an insured exclusive authority to regulate and tax surplus lines insurance transactions, and regulators in a ceding insurer’s state of domicile the sole responsibility for regulating the balance sheet credit that the ceding insurer may take for reinsurance recoverables.
Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the health insurance industry, or changes to existing laws and regulations, may transpire. The PPACA was signed into law in 2010, and, throughout 2017 and 2018, there were several judicial and congressional challenges and proposed amendments to the PPACA. The TCJA also includes a provision that repealed certain aspects of the PPACA. If we are unable to adapt our A&H business to current and/or future requirements of the health insurance legislation, our A&H business could be materially adversely affected.
Other possible federal regulatory developments include the introduction of legislation in Congress that would repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act antitrust exemption for the insurance industry. The antitrust exemption allows insurers to compile and share loss data, develop standard policy forms and manuals and predict future loss costs with greater reliability, among other things. The ability of the industry, under the exemption permitted in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, to collect loss cost data and build a credible database as a means of predicting future loss costs is an important part of cost-based pricing. If the ability to collect this data were removed, the predictability of future loss costs and the reliability of pricing could be undermined.
In recent years, the lender-placed insurance business has been subject to class action litigation and investigations by state insurance regulators and federal regulatory agencies. Litigation and regulatory proceedings have included allegations of excessive premium rates and inappropriate business transactions. Unfavorable outcomes of litigation or regulatory investigations or significant problems in our relationships with regulators could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, reputation, and ability to continue to do business. They could also expose us to further investigations or litigation. In addition, certain of our customers in the mortgage industry are the subject of various regulatory investigations and/or litigation regarding mortgage lending practices, which could indirectly affect agreements with these clients and our business.
Privacy Regulations
In 1999, Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which, among other things, protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal information. Subsequently, states have implemented additional regulations to address privacy issues. Certain aspects of these laws and regulations apply to all financial institutions, including insurance and finance companies, and require us to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our policyholders. We may also be subject to future privacy laws and regulations, which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition. In 2000, the NAIC adopted the Privacy of Consumer Financial and Health Information Model Regulation, which assisted states in promulgating regulations to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. In 2002, to further facilitate the implementation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the NAIC adopted the Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Model Regulation. Several states have now adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of policyholder information.
Additionally, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and the more recent 2013 Omnibus Rule, dictates the dissemination of an individual’s personal health information by covered entities and their business associates. These laws and their implementing regulations apply to health care providers and health insurers, and thereby requires our 
A&H business to maintain policies and procedures with regard to the storage, maintenance and disclosure of our policyholders’ personal health information.
Cybersecurity Regulation
Insurance regulators have been focusing increased attention on data security during financial exams, and new laws and regulations are pending that would impose new requirements and standards for protecting personally identifiable information of insurance company policyholders. For example, the New York Department of Financial Services enacted a comprehensive cybersecurity regulation that became effective during 2017, requiring insurance companies and other entities to have a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers’ private data; a written policy that is approved by the board or a senior officer; a chief information security officer to help protect data and systems; and controls and plans in place to help ensure the safety of New York’s financial services industry. In addition, the NAIC has adopted the Roadmap for Cybersecurity Consumer Protections, a set of directives aimed at protecting consumer data, and is working on a new model data security law that is expected to incorporate the directives and impose additional requirements on insurance companies to the extent ultimately adopted by applicable state legislation. The NAIC has also strengthened and enhanced the cybersecurity guidance included in its handbook for state insurance examiners. We anticipate a continuing focus on new regulatory and legislative proposals at the state and federal levels that further regulate practices regarding privacy and security of personal information.
Our Swedish entities are subject to the recently enacted European Union (“E.U.”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). GDPR is global in scope to the extent that it applies to all business in the E.U. and any business outside the E.U. that processes E.U. personal data of individuals in the E.U. The regulation is in place to enhance the rights and protections of E.U. citizens’ personal data and non-compliance can potentially lead to financial penalties. The introduction of GDPR, and any changes in E.U. member states’ national laws and regulations, may increase our compliance obligations and may necessitate the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data.
Telephone Sales Regulations
The United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and various states have promulgated and enacted rules and laws that govern telephone solicitations. There are numerous state statutes and regulations governing telephone sales activities that do or may apply to our operations, including the operations of our call center insurance agencies. For example, some states place restrictions on the methods and timing of calls and require that certain mandatory disclosures be made during the course of a telephone sales call. Federal and state “Do Not Call” regulations must be followed for us to engage in telephone sales activities.
Foreign Regulation
Classification
Our Bermuda subsidiary, National General Re Ltd. (“NG Re”) is registered as an insurer by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”) under the Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda, as amended (the “Insurance Act - Bermuda”). The BMA is responsible for the day-to-day supervision of insurers and monitors compliance with the solvency and liquidity standards imposed by the Insurance Act - Bermuda. NG Re is registered as a Class 3A insurer. Accordingly, NG Re can carry on general business, broadly including all types of insurance business other than long-term business.
Annual Financial Statements, Annual Statutory Financial Return and Annual Capital and Solvency Return
NG Re is required to file annually with the BMA financial statements, a statutory financial return and a capital and solvency return. The statutory financial return for an insurer includes, among other matters, statutory financial statements, a report of the approved auditor on the statutory financial statements, and, a declaration of compliance confirming compliance with various minimum criteria, including certifying the company meets the minimum solvency margin. The capital and solvency return includes NG Re's Bermuda solvency capital return model for a Class 3A insurer, a commercial insurer's solvency self-assessment, a reconciliation of net loss reserves, schedule of solvency, financial condition report, an opinion of the company’s loss reserve specialist, a schedule of eligible capital and an economic balance sheet. The capital and solvency return also includes a capital and solvency declaration that the return fairly represents the financial condition of NG Re in all material respects.
Insurance Code of Conduct
The Insurance Code of Conduct prescribes the duties and standards with which registered insurers must adhere and comply, to ensure that the registered insurer implements sound corporate governance, risk management and internal controls. Failure to comply with these requirements is a factor considered by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner. Any failure to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Code of Conduct could result in the BMA exercising its statutory powers of intervention.
Minimum Solvency Margin and Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions
Under the Insurance Act - Bermuda, the value of the general business assets of a registered Class 3A insurer, such as NG Re, must exceed the amount of its general business liabilities by an amount greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margin.
NG Re could not declare or pay dividends during any financial year if it is in breach of its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio or if it would fail to meet such margin or ratio as a result. In addition, BMA approval would be required prior to declaring or paying dividends in any financial year NG Re failed to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year.
As a registered Class 3A insurer, NG Re is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends of more than 25% of its previous year’s total statutory capital and surplus unless it files with the BMA an affidavit stating it will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements. In addition, NG Re is prohibited, without the approval of the BMA, from reducing by 15% or more its total statutory capital as set out in its previous year’s financial statements.
Minimum Liquidity Ratio
Under the Insurance Act - Bermuda, an insurer engaged in general business, such as NG Re, is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities.
Solvency II
The E.U. has adopted a directive, known as Solvency II, covering capital requirements, risk management and regulatory reporting for insurance organizations. Solvency II applies to our Swedish entities, and Solvency II equivalence (an insurance regulatory regime that achieves the same outcomes-based results as Solvency II) applies to our Bermuda entities. Solvency II imposes economic risk-based solvency requirements that comprise three pillars. First, there are quantitative capital requirements, based on a valuation of the entire balance sheet of an insurance organization. Second, Solvency II requires insurance organizations to undertake a qualitative regulatory review, including governance, internal controls, enterprise risk management and the supervisory review process. Third, to enhance market discipline, insurance organizations must report their financial conditions to regulators.
