Item 1. Business
 
When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms "Statera Biopharma," the "Company," "Statera," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Statera Biopharma, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, Cytocom Subsidiary, Inc., ImQuest Life Sciences, Inc, , ImQuest BioSciences Inc., ImQuest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lubrinovation Inc., BioLab 612 (until its dissolution), LLC, TNI Biotech Intl, Inc. and Panacela Labs, Inc.
 
GENERAL OVERVIEW
 
We are a pre-clinical and clinical biopharmaceutical company developing multiple product candidates to address unmet medical needs for use in diseases involving immune system dysfunction. Prior to the closing of the Merger (as defined below), we focused exclusively on developing novel approaches to modulate the immune system. Our proprietary platform of Toll-like receptor drug candidates has applications in mitigation of radiation injury, mitigation of T-cell exhaustion, inflammation, T-cell exhaustion, immune system dysfunction, oncology, infection and neutropenia. We combine our proven scientific expertise and our depth of knowledge about our products’ mechanisms of action into a passion for developing drugs to save lives. Our most advanced product candidate in this field is entolimod, an immune-stimulatory agent, which we are developing as a radiation countermeasure and other indications in radiation oncology.
 
Following the closing of the Merger, we are also now developing novel immunotherapies targeting autoimmune, inflammatory, emerging viruses and cancers based on a proprietary, multi receptor platform, or the Pan-TLR Platform, designed to restore the body’s immune system and restore homeostasis. These therapies are designed to elicit directly within patients a robust and durable response of antigen-specific killer T- cells and antibodies, thereby activating essential immune defenses against autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious diseases, and cancers. We believe that our technologies can meaningfully leverage the human immune system for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes by eliciting killer T-cell response levels not achieved by other known immunotherapy approaches. Our immunomodulatory technology restores the balance between the cellular (Th1) and the humoral (Th2) immune systems. Immune balance is regulated through T-helper cells that produce cytokines. The Th1 lymphocytes help fight pathogens within cells like cancer and viruses through interferon-gamma and macrophages. The Th2 lymphocytes target external pathogens like cytotoxic parasites, allergens, toxins through the activation of B-cells and antibody production to effect to dendritic cells, which are natural activators of killer T cells, also known as cytotoxic T -cells, or CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, Statera's technology antagonizes the toll-like receptors (TLR2, 4, 5, 7 and 9) to inhibit proinflammatory cytokines and modulating immune system function.
 
CORPORATE INFORMATION
 
We were originally incorporated in Delaware in June 2003 as a corporation spun off from The Cleveland Clinic. Prior to the Merger in 2021, we exclusively licensed our founding intellectual property from The Cleveland Clinic. As a result of the Merger, we acquired additional intellectual property from Old Cytocom and ImQuest.
2021 Merger between Cytocom Inc. and Cleveland BioLabs, Inc.
 
On July 27, 2021, the Company, then known as Cleveland BioLabs, Inc., High Street Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), and Cytocom Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation then known as "Cytocom Inc." ("Old Cytocom"), completed their previously announced merger transaction. The merger transaction was completed pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of October 16, 2020, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Old Cytocom, with Old Cytocom continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the surviving corporation of the merger (the "Merger"). Upon completion of the Merger, each outstanding share of Old Cytocom common stock and preferred stock, and each vested restricted stock unit of Old Cytocom (excluding, in each case, dissenting shares and shares held in treasury) automatically converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Company common stock determined by the application of an exchange ratio formula set forth in the Merger Agreement. In connection with the closing of the Merger, Old Cytocom was renamed "Cytocom Subsidiary Inc." and the Company was renamed "Cytocom, Inc." Effective September 1, 2021, the Company changed its corporate name to "Statera Biopharma, Inc." 
Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures
 Prior to the Merger, the Company conducted business in the United States ("U.S.") directly and in the Russian Federation ("Russia") through two subsidiaries: one wholly owned subsidiary, BioLab 612, LLC ("BioLab 612"), which began operations in 2012 and was dissolved in November 2020; and Panacela Labs, Inc.  ("Panacela"), which was formed by us and Joint Stock Company "RUSNANO" ("RUSNANO"), our financial partner in the venture, in 2011. 
 
On June 24, 2021, Old Cytocom completed the acquisition of ImQuest Life Sciences, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("ImQuest") in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Old Cytocom and ImQuest dated as of July 17, 2020 (such transaction, the "ImQuest Merger"), and gained control of ImQuest. The purchase consideration due under this acquisition to the former shareholders of ImQuest consisted of 3,282,089 shares of common stock of Statera Biopharma. ImQuest is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Operating primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary - ImQuest BioSciences - ImQuest is a preclinical contract research organization ("CRO") that provides services to evaluate the potential of new and novel pharmaceutical products for the treatment and prevention of viruses, bacteria, cancer and inflammatory diseases. These preclinical research services include compound screening to define compound efficacy and drug target validation to define the mechanism of action and toxicity of pharmaceutical products. 

 Since inception we have formed several subsidiaries to best capitalize on our ability to leverage financial and clinical development resources in Russia. In December 2009, we created Incuron LLC ("Incuron") with BioProcess Capital Ventures ("BCV") to develop Curaxin compounds (defined below). We have since sold our equity interest in Incuron, but maintain a right to royalty payments, as later described, and we conduct drug development activities on behalf of Incuron in the U.S. In September 2011, we created Panacela, a U.S. entity, with Joint Stock Company "Rusnano" ("Rusnano") to develop Mobilan and other product candidates (described below.)
 
Simultaneous with the formation of Panacela, was the creation of a wholly-owned Russian subsidiary of Panacela named Panacela Labs, LLC. Statera and Panacela each have development and commercialization rights to product candidates in development, subject to certain financial obligations to our current licensors.
 In 2018, we formed Genome Protection, Inc. ("GPI") with Everon Biosciences, Inc. ("Everon") to undertake a research and development program aimed at clinical testing of entolimod and GP532 (a variant of our entolimod drug candidate) and the development of medications with anti-aging and other indications associated with genome damage. GPI is recorded under the equity method of accounting in the accompanying financial statements. The Company has not recorded its 50% share of the losses of GPI through December 31, 2021 as the impact would have reduced the Company's equity method investment in GPI below zero, and there are no requirements to fund the Company's share of these losses or contribute additional capital as of the date of these statements. 
 
Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "STAB."
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 4333 Corbett Drive, Suite 1082, Fort Collins, CO 80525, and our telephone number at that address is (888) 613-8802.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE
 
The Company is a discovery and developmental-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapies targeting autoimmune, cytopenias including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia, emerging viruses and cancers based on a proprietary platform designed to rebalance the body’s immune system and restore homeostasis. Statera has a large platform of compounds targeting the following Toll-like Receptors (TLR) with TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7 and TLR9. Statera is developing therapies designed to directly elicit within patients a robust and durable response, thereby activating essential immune defenses against autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious diseases, and cancers. Statera has clinical programs for Crohn’s disease (STAT-201) and hematology/oncology (STAT-601) in addition to potential expansion into fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis. 
 
The Company is currently pursuing the following clinical stage development programs:
 



• | STAT-201 as an adjunct to the standard of care in pediatric Crohn’s disease. STAT-201 is intended to target the restoration of mucosal healing and intestinal barrier function in pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease via immune homeostasis and decreased inflammation. Based on the available data, Statera believes there is an opportunity for STAT-201 to be developed as a differentiated immunotherapy for the treatment of pediatric patients with active Crohn’s disease. Statera expects to initiate a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of STAT-201 in pediatric subjects with active Crohn’s disease in mid-2023.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | STAT-202 to reduce the pain associated with fibromyalgia. STAT-202 is intended to reduce the pain associated with fibromyalgia. Subject to discussions with the FDA, submission and acceptance of an IND, and adequate financial capital Statera may develop STAT-202 for fibromyalgia in, 2023/2024. 
• | STAT-203 to prevent disease progression in patients with MS. Statera intends to develop STAT-203 to prevent disease progression in patients with MS. Subject to discussions with the FDA submission and acceptance of an IND, and adequate financial capital, Statera may develop STAT-203 targeting a potential phase 1/2 clinical trial, in 2023. 
• | STAT-300 series Pan-Toll-like Receptor (‘Pan-TLR’) ligands. The Company has discovered new chemical entities that have demonstrated broad Toll-like Receptor activity in vitro. These compounds have the potential to modulate immune system function as well as potentially inflammation. The Company intends to select a lead candidate and progress through IND-enabled testing. 
• | STAT-601 (Entolimod) to be used as a radiomitigant in biodefense and as a T-cell exhaustion in oncology settings. STAT-601 is an injectable biologic that Statera intends to develop. Statera has submitted a protocol and on December 1, 2021 announced the FDA lifted the clinical hold, but we have not yet initiated discussion with the FDA for additional studies in the oncology setting. The Company also intends to pursue the mitigation or reversal of T-cell exhaustion in cancer patients by using entolimod to stimulate white blood cell production. 
• | STAT-800 natural product-derived compounds for inflammatory and immune disease. STAT-800 compounds are being screened from large sources of bioactive natural product libraries. The sources range from plant to microbiological. The compounds will be screened through our subsidiary, ImQuest, and any resulting hits will be evaluated for potential commercial viability. 

Product Development Strategy
 
Key components of the Company’s strategy include the following:
 

• | Continue our STAT-200 program through partnerships or out-licensing. Subject to discussions with the FDA, the Company is in the process of initiating a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of STAT-201 in pediatric subjects with active Crohn’s disease. Subject to discussions with the FDA and submission and acceptance of additional Investigational New Drug applications ("INDs"), we are planning on (i) initiating clinical trials in 2023 and 2024 for certain immune mediated diseases such as fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis. We are actively targeting potential partners or out-licensees for our STAT-200 series programs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Maximize the commercial potential of the STAT-300 Series and our Pan-Toll-like Receptor program or Pan-TLR Program. If any molecules in our product candidates in the STAT-300 Series demonstrate efficacy in an in vivo model, the Company intends to build a development program for that molecule to look for an autoimmune and inflammatory disease indication. If any of the Company’s current product candidates receive approval for Phase I clinical testing, the Company will look to partner or license the molecule/program with a strategic company that is interested in the proposed indication. 
• | Leverage the Company’s Pan-TLR platform to develop product candidates for additional indications. The Company will seek to leverage its Pan-TLR platform to develop therapies for multiple cancers, HINI, influenza A and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. The Company may also seek to develop STAT-300 analogs for the treatment of other hematology and neurology related conditions. 
• | Evaluate business development opportunities and potential collaborations. The Company plans to evaluate the merits of entering into collaboration agreements or acquiring other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies that may contribute to our mission of building a world leading immunology pipeline. The Company is currently in discussions with companies that have a global or regional interest in the Company’s pipeline assets that could potentially provide capital and resources to advance the clinical development and commercialization of the Company’s pipeline. The Company is also currently in discussions with a few companies regarding acquisitions and mergers of synergistic technologies and/or pipelines. 
• | Leverage acquisition of ImQuest Life Sciences to produce revenue and strengthen product development capabilities. The Company believes that the addition of ImQuest Life Sciences will provide the Company the potential to expand its relationships in the drug development arena while strengthening its own product development capabilities and revenue generation.

Pan-Toll-like Receptor Platform or Pan-TLR Platform
 
We are developing our proprietary multi-TLR receptor platform, or Pan-TLR Platform, to serve as a drug discovery and development engine leveraging expertise, knowledge, chemistry and computational capabilities in the TLR space. The Pan-Toll platform is designed to develop compounds that inhibit or activate multiple Toll-like Receptors simultaneously to address numerous therapeutic areas including autoimmune, inflammation, emerging viruses and cancers. We have expanded our understanding of the relationship between multiple TLR’s analogs determining how multiple factors impact pharmacokinetic – pharmacodynamic relationships, potency, and selectivity in relation to the immune system. Statera Biopharma believes its multi-receptor platform is an instrument permitting the increased probability of success.
 

1. | STAT-200 Programs
---+------------------

 
The STAT-200 AIMS program centers around developing noroxymorphone analogs that modulate numerous receptors associated with autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases and cancers. Targeted receptors include TLR-4/9 and opioid receptors such as Mu, Kappa and Delta. The Company seeks to manipulate analogs of noroxymorphone to specifically modulate and target opioid growth factor receptors and toll-like receptors to tune a robust and durable response of antigen-specific killer T-cells and antibodies and bring balance to the Th1 cellular (Th1) and humoral (Th2) immune system.
 
The STAT-200 AIMS program utilizes an orally delivered small molecule inhibitor of the opioid receptors and toll-like receptors at low doses of noroxymorphone or similar analogs aimed at restoring immune homeostasis and blocking proinflammatory cytokines, based on earlier proof of concept data including human clinical study data. The Company intends to develop noroxymorphone and analogs based on clinical and mechanistic data for autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn’s disease, fibromyalgia, and MS, as well as explore basic scientific mechanisms that enhance the efficacy or safety for its platform for future indications.
 

2. | STAT-300 Programs
---+------------------

Development Programs from Legacy Cleveland BioLabs
 
Entolimod is a Toll-like receptor 5, or ("TLR5"), agonist, which we are targeting for out-licensing for use as a medical radiation countermeasure, or ("MRC"), to reduce the risk of death following exposure to potentially lethal irradiation from Acute Radiation Syndrome, or ("ARS").  We are also evaluating other potential indications, including immunotherapy for oncology. To date, Entolimod as an MRC was being developed under the FDA’s Animal Efficacy Rule for the indication of reducing the risk of death following exposure to potentially lethal irradiation occurring as a result of a radiation disaster.
 
Up to the time of the Merger, the Company’s product development programs and their respective development stages were as illustrated below
 



The Company’s product development efforts were initiated by discoveries related to apoptosis, a tightly regulated form of cell death that can occur in response to internal stresses or external events such as exposure to radiation or toxic chemicals. Apoptosis is a major determinant of the tissue damage that occurs in a variety of medical conditions involving ischemia, or temporary loss of blood flow, such as cerebral stroke, heart attack and acute renal failure. In addition, apoptotic loss of cells of the hematopoietic system and gastrointestinal tract is largely responsible for the acute lethality of high-dose radiation exposure. On the other hand, apoptosis is also an important protective mechanism that allows the body to eliminate defective cells such as those with cancer-forming potential.
 
The Company has developed novel strategies to target the molecular mechanisms controlling apoptotic cell death for therapeutic benefit. These strategies take advantage of the fact that tumor and normal cells respond to apoptosis-inducing stresses differently due to tumor-specific defects in cellular signaling pathways such as inactivation of p53 (a pro-apoptosis regulator) and constitutive activation of Nuclear Factor kappa-B ("NF-kB"), (a pro-survival regulator).
 
Thus, the Company designed two oppositely-directed general therapeutic concepts:
 

(a) | temporary and reversible suppression of apoptosis in normal cells to protect healthy tissues from stress-induced damage using compounds the Company categorizes as Protectans, which include entolimod and Mobilan; and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | reactivation of apoptosis in tumor cells to eliminate cancer using compounds the Company categorizes as Curaxins, which includes CBL0137, currently being developed by its former subsidiary, Incuron.

In recent years, the Company’ understanding of the mechanisms of actions underlying the activity of these compounds has grown substantially beyond the initial founding concepts around modulation of apoptosis.

Entolimod Biodefense Indication
 
The Company’s most advanced Protectan product candidate is entolimod, an engineered derivative of the Salmonella flagellin protein that was designed to retain its specific TLR5-activating capacity while increasing its stability, reducing its immunogenicity and enabling high-yield production. The Company has been developing entolimod as a medical radiation countermeasure for reducing the risk of death from ARS, which is referred to as a Biodefense Indication. The U.S. government maintains a national stockpile of products for emergency use (the "National Stockpile"), the Company believes the potential markets for the sale of radiation countermeasures include U.S. federal, state and local.
 
Acute high-dose whole body or significant partial body radiation exposure induces massive apoptosis of cells of the hematopoietic system and gastrointestinal tract, which leads to ARS, a potentially fatal condition. The threat of ARS is primarily limited to emergency/defense scenarios and is significant given the possibility of nuclear/radiological accidents, warfare or terrorist incidents. The Company believes the limitations of the four currently approved treatments to deal with such an event make entolimod a compelling product candidate. It is not feasible or ethical to test the efficacy of entolimod as a radiation countermeasure in humans. Therefore, the Company has been developing entolimod under the FDA’s Animal Rule guidance (see "– Government Regulation – Animal Rule"). The Animal Rule authorizes the FDA to rely on data from animal studies to provide evidence of a product’s effectiveness under circumstances where there is a reasonably well-understood mechanism for the activity of the product.
 
The Company’s pivotal efficacy study conducted in 179 non-human primates demonstrated with a high degree of statistical significance that injection of a single dose of entolimod given to rhesus macaques 25 hours after exposure to a 70% lethal dose of total body irradiation improved animal survival by nearly three-fold compared to the control group. Dose-dependence of entolimod’s efficacy was demonstrated with doses above the minimal efficacious dose establishing a plateau at approximately 75% survival at 60 days after irradiation, as compared to 27.5% survival in the placebo-treated group.
 
The Company’s clinical studies of entolimod in 150 healthy human subjects demonstrated the safety profile of entolimod and established the dose-dependent effect of entolimod on efficacy biomarkers in humans. In these studies, and in the oncology studies in which more than 60 cancer patients have been administered to date, transient decrease in blood pressure and elevation of liver enzymes were observed along with transient mild to moderate flu-like syndrome. The FDA has granted Fast Track status to entolimod (see "– Government Regulation – Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designation") and Orphan Drug status for prevention of death following a potentially lethal dose of total body irradiation during or after a radiation disaster (see "– Government Regulation – Orphan Drug").
 
The Company has completed two Good Clinical Practices clinical studies designed to evaluate the safety of Entolimod in a total of 150 healthy subjects. We have completed a Good Laboratory Practices, or "GLP," in an open-label, placebo-controlled, pivotal study designed to evaluate the dose-dependent effect of Entolimod on biomarker induction in 160 non-irradiated non-human primates. In 2015, following confirmation from the FDA of the sufficiency of our existing efficacy and safety data and animal-to-human dose conversion, we submitted to the FDA an application for pre-Emergency Use Authorization, or "pre-EUA," a form of authorization granted by the FDA under certain circumstances. During the pendency of the pre-EUA application, the FDA had requested additional data and studies, as a result of which the FDA placed our clinical protocol on clinical hold. On May 27, 2021, the FDA indicated that additional information was required to meet the criteria for a potential emergency use authorization, including clinical studies to evaluate this additional information.
 
The Company has also completed a Phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation trial of Entolimod in 26 patients with advanced cancer in the United States. The data for the U.S. study were presented at the 2015 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or "ASCO." Seven (7) additional patients have been dosed with the Entolimod drug formulation proposed for commercialization under the pre-EUA in an extension of this study performed in the Russian Federation.
 
On December 1, 2021, the Company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had lifted the clinical hold placed on the Company’s Entolimod research and development activity in ARS.
 
As discussed above, the Company is seeking a partnership to support ongoing development of the BLA authorization for biodefence applications from the FDA for entolimod.
 
Entolimod T-cell Exhaustion Indication
 
The Company also intends to develop entolimod for use in patients suffering from T-cell exhaustion.  T-cell exhaustion is a broad term that has been used to describe the response of T cells to chronic antigen stimulation, in response to tumors. T-cell exhaustion is seen in patients with chronic exposure to cancer and have failed CAR-T therapy or even PD-1 or PDL-1 therapy due to a lack of a viable immune response by T-cell activation. Understanding the features of and pathways to exhaustion has crucial implications for the success of checkpoint blockade (PD-1 or PDL-1 inhibitors) and adoptive T-cell transfer therapies (CAR-T).

Entolimod Oncology Indication
 
In addition to developing entolimod as a MRC for reducing the risk of death from ARS, the Company has initiated an evaluation of entolimod's potential to treat cancer by activating the innate and adaptive immune response in patients. In preclinical studies, entolimod produced tissue-specific activation of innate immune responses via interaction with its receptor, TLR5, and the liver was identified as a primary mediator of entolimod activity. Entolimod has also been shown to have a direct cytotoxic effect on tumors expressing TLR5 in animal models. Evaluations of local administration of entolimod in organs expressing TLR5, such as the bladder, have also been performed in animal models.
 
The Company completed a Phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation trial of entolimod in 26 patients with advanced cancer in the U.S. in 2015 and an extension study in additional patients in Russia receiving the entolimod drug product formulation proposed for commercialization is ongoing. The data for the U.S. study were presented at the 2015 annual meeting of ASCO. 26 patients with previously treated metastatic cancers, including colorectal, non-small cell lung, anal and urothelial bladder tumors were enrolled in the study. Stable disease for more than 6 weeks was observed in 8 patients with various cancer types; among these, 3 patients (with anal, colorectal and urothelial cancers) had maintenance of stable disease for more than 12 weeks. Patients exhibited CD8+ T-cell activation with stable or decreased levels of myeloid-derived suppressive cells, accompanied by increased immunostimulatory cytokines (G-CSF, IL-6, and IL-8). The tolerability profile in patients with advanced cancer was similar to that observed in two previously conducted studies in 150 healthy subjects receiving entolimod. As expected with activation of innate immune pathways, common adverse events were flu-like symptoms and fever, with some patients having transient, spontaneously resolving tachycardia, hypotension and hyperglycemia. Overall, treatment with entolimod was well tolerated.
 
In addition, the Company conducted a clinical study of the safety and tolerability of entolimod as a neo-adjuvant therapy before cancer surgery in treatment-naïve patients with primary colorectal cancer. Because the study included older patients (up to 84 years) and those with other health conditions, the trial further extended an understanding of entolimod effects in a broader population of study patients. The safety profile of the drug appeared generally similar to the profiles previously identified in healthy subjects and patients with cancer who participated in prior studies. Increases in plasma cytokines and alterations of blood cells were observed that appeared consistent with TLR5-mediated mobilization and trafficking of immunocytes to peripheral tissues, although changes in tumor immune cell infiltration appeared to be independent of treatment group in this exploratory study.
 
In February 2016, the Company announced the publication of studies elucidating immunotherapeutic mechanisms through which entolimod suppresses metastasis in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ("PNAS"). The studies presented in the PNAS publication decipher the cascade of cell-signaling events that are triggered by entolimod activation of the TLR5 pathway in the liver. The data also define the functional roles of natural killer ("NK"), dendritic, and CD8+ T-cells in the drug’s activity as a suppressor of metastasis. The studies demonstrate that entolimod administration may induce chemokines that attract NK cells to the liver via a CXCR3-dependent mechanism. CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor that is highly expressed on both NK and effector T cells and plays an important role in cell trafficking to tissues. Once in the liver, NK cells, which are components of the innate immune system, engage an adaptive antitumor immune response through dendritic cell activation. This NK-to-dendritic cell interaction generates CD8+ T-cell-dependent antitumor memory that results in tumor rejection upon animal re-challenge with tumor. Importantly, localized antitumor effects in the liver combine with systemic responses that enable suppression of metastasis to the lung.
 
In the third quarter of 2018, the Company created GPI, its joint venture with Everon. GPI, which is currently 50% owned by the Company and 50% owned by Everon, is undertaking a research and development program aimed at clinical testing of Entolimod and GP532, (a second generation TLR5 candidate) and the development of medications with anti-aging and other indications associated with genome damage. GPI is being initially funded by an investment from the venture capital fund Norma Investments Limited ("Norma"). Under the terms of the arrangement with Norma, GPI granted Norma the right to purchase shares of GPI’s capital stock in the future in exchange for the payment of up to $30 million, of which $10.5 million was paid shortly after execution of the relevant transaction documents.
 
We understand that until February 2022 Norma was majority controlled or owned, indirectly, by Roman Abramovich, a global investor with ties to high-level members of the government of Russia. While neither Norma nor Mr. Abramovich have been the subject of sanctions by the US Government, the government of the United Kingdom ("UK") has ordered asset freezes, imposed travel bans and otherwise imposed sanctions on Mr. Abramovich. Major media organizations have reported that ownership in Norma was transferred from Mr. Abramovich to David Davidovich, the holder of approximately 13% of our common stock who is not, as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, subject to sanctions by the US or UK governments. If governing authorities in the UK unwind this transfer or if Norma or Mr. Davidovich become subject to sanctions by the US or UK governments, it may be difficult or impossible for Norma, which is a British Virgin Islands company subject to UK jurisdiction, to invest further funds in GPI and/or for GPI to issue shares or remit funds to Norma should the contractual terms of Norma’s investment in GPI otherwise require it to.
 
On August 6, 2018, the Company entered into a license agreement with GPI pursuant to which the Company licensed to GPI, on an exclusive basis, the right to develop, manufacture, commercialize, and sell entolimod in the field of use related to the prevention or treatment of any disease, disorder, or frailty in humans caused by aging, including treatment of "cancer survivors" (i.e., persons who are proclaimed to be "cancer free" at the time of treatment, but have been damaged by conventional cancer therapy). The Company retained the exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to entolimod for use as an ARS indication and concurrent radiation treatment of humans diagnosed with oncological conditions at the time of treatment.
 
Mobilan
 
Mobilan is the lead product candidate of Panacela. Mobilan is a recombinant non-replicating adenovirus that directs expression of TLR5 and its agonistic ligand, a secretory non-glycosylated version of entolimod. In preclinical studies, delivery of Mobilan to tumor cells was shown to impact constitutive autocrine TLR5 signaling and strong activation of the innate immune system with subsequent development of adaptive anti-tumor immune responses.
 
In 2016, Panacela completed enrollment of patients in a Phase 1 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded study in Russia evaluating single injections of ascending doses of Mobilan administered directly into the prostate of patients with prostate cancer Panacela holds exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to Mobilan
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company owned 67.57% of Panacela's outstanding equity securities.
 
CBL0137
 
CBL0137 is a small molecule with a multi-targeted mechanism of action that may be broadly useful for the treatment of many different types of cancer and is being developed by Incuron. During 2015 the Company sold its remaining equity interest in Incuron but retains a 2% royalty on (a) product sales of CBL0137, (b) consideration received by Incuron from a licensee or sublicensee, and (c) consideration received in connection with the first change of control of Incuron. Incuron’s royalty obligations continue until April 29, 2025.
 
CBL0137 may offer greater efficacy and substantially lower risk for the development of drug resistance than conventional chemotherapeutic agents. CBL0137 inhibits MYC protein, NF-kB, Heat Shock Factor Protein-1 ("HSF-1"), and Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha; these are transcription factors that are important for the viability of many types of tumors. The drug also activates tumor suppressor protein p53 by modulating intracellular localization and activity of chromatin remodeling complex Facilitates Chromatin Transcription ("FACT"). CBL0137 has been shown to be efficacious in animal models of colon, lung, breast, renal, pancreatic, head and neck and prostate cancers; melanoma; glioblastoma; and neuroblastoma.
 
Incuron holds worldwide development and commercialization rights to CBL0137.

STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS
 
Since our inception, strategic alliances and collaborations have been integral to our business. We have exclusively licensed rights in certain of our technologies from The Cleveland Clinic and Roswell Park Cancer Center "RPCI" and maintain innovative partnerships with each. We have also leveraged the experience, contacts and knowledge of our founders to engage financial partners in Russia. Through these partnerships we have collaborated with scientists from other countries to develop our novel technologies and accessed non-traditional funding sources, including U.S. federal and foreign government contracts and project-oriented funding. We have received project-oriented funding from Rusnano through the formation of Panacela.
 
Panacela maintains operations in Russia and benefits from programs supporting domestic pharmaceutical industry development in Russia.
 
La Jolla Institute for Immunology
 
On August 1, 2021, as previously disclosed, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement to fund research and laboratory facilities at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology ("LJI"), a not-for-profit academic institution widely recognized in the field of immunology research. The agreement is directed to research that will support the development of potential new immune-modulating agents targeting toll-like receptors for the treatment of cancer, infectious, autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. The research is intended harness the Company’s proprietary drug discovery and development platform technology.
 
Under the terms of the research agreement, LJI may select up to four laboratories to participate in research. The Company will provide research funding to these laboratories for projects of mutual interest or for research projects commissioned by us that explore immune modulation and the action of therapeutics on target toll-like receptors. Toll-like receptors are central to an immune response, connecting innate and adaptive immune compartments, and thus key to fighting disease as well as restoring immune homeostasis. In addition to the research funding for the selected projects, the Company will pay LJI $350,000 per year for each selected laboratory, for a total annual discretionary funding contribution of up to $1.4 million, in addition to the research funding itself. We will also provide researchers at LJI with samples and materials. In return, the Company will have a first option to negotiate a license to new discoveries by LJI that arise from the research projects of common interest funded by the Company; however, we will own any new discoveries that arise from research projects of interest to the Company that may have been commissioned to the LJI as a "work for hire."
 
The Cleveland Clinic
 
In July 2004, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with The Cleveland Clinic ("The Cleveland Clinic License") pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive license to The Cleveland Clinic’s research base underlying our STAT-601 (entolimod) therapeutic platform. We amended The Cleveland Clinic License, effective as of September 22, 2011, pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive license to The Cleveland Clinic’s research base underlying certain product candidates in development by Panacela ("Panacela Products"), including Mobilan and several earlier-stage compounds that are not currently material to our business.
 
In consideration for The Cleveland Clinic License, we agreed to issue The Cleveland Clinic common stock and make certain milestone, royalty, and sublicense royalty payments as described below.
 
The Cleveland Clinic License requires milestone payments, which may be credited against future royalties owed to The Cleveland Clinic, as described in the table below.
 

Milestone Description | For Products Limited to Biodefense Uses | | For All Other Products (Maximum amount)* | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------+--
For any IND filing for a product | $ | 50,000 | | $ | 50,000 
For any product entering Phase II clinical trials or similar registration | | 100,000 | | | 250,000 
For any product entering Phase III clinical trials | | — | | | 700,000 
For any product license application, BLA or NDA Filing for a product** | | 350,000 | | | 1,500,000
Upon regulatory approval permitting any product to be sold to the commercial market | | 1,000,000 | | | 4,000,000


* | Maximum amounts listed for achievement of milestone in U.S. If milestones are reached in another country first, milestone payments will be prorated for certain products under the license based on the market size for the product in such country as that market relates to the then current U.S. market.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** | New Drug Application ("NDA") 

 
We have also agreed to make milestone payments of up to approximately $6.5 million for each Panacela Product that achieves certain developmental and regulatory milestones, provided that if the Company or one of its affiliates and The Cleveland Clinic jointly own the Panacela Product, the milestone amounts will be reduced by 50%.
 
We will be obligated to make royalty payments to The Cleveland Clinic License of (a) 2% of net sales of any product candidate under a licensed patent solely owned by The Cleveland Clinic; and (b) 1% of net sales of any product candidate under a licensed patent that is jointly owned by The Cleveland Clinic and the Company or an affiliate of the Company. Further, if we receive upfront sublicense fees or sublicense royalty payments for sublicenses granted by us to third parties for any licensed patents solely owned by The Cleveland Clinic, we will pay The Cleveland Clinic (i) 35% of such fees if the sublicense is granted prior to filing an IND application, (ii) 20% of such fees if the sublicense is granted after an IND filing but prior to final approval of the Product License Application or NDA, or (iii) 10% of such fees if the sublicense is granted after final approval of the relevant Product License Application or NDA, provided that such sublicense fees shall not be less than 1% of net sales. The above sublicense fees and sublicense royalty payments are reduced by 50% if The Cleveland Clinic and the Company or an affiliate of the Company jointly own the licensed patent.
 
Through December 31, 2021, we had paid The Cleveland Clinic $150,000 for milestone payments on products limited to biodefense uses, and $400,000 for all other products.

Roswell Park Cancer Institute
 
We have entered into a number of agreements with RPCI relating to the licensure and development of our product candidates including:
 

• | Two exclusive license and option agreements effective December 2007 and September 2011; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Various sponsored research agreements entered into between January 2007 to present; and 
• | Clinical trial agreements for the conduct of our Phase 1 entolimod oncology study and Incuron’s Phase 1 CBL0137 intravenous administration study.

 
In December 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with RPCI pursuant to which the Company has an option to exclusively license any technological improvements to our foundational technology developed by RPCI for the term of the agreement. We believe our option to license additional technology under the agreement potentially provides us with access to technology that may supplement our product pipeline in the future. In consideration for this option and exclusive license, we agreed to make certain milestone, royalty and sublicense royalty payments.
 
In September 2011, Panacela entered into an agreement with RPCI (the "Panacela-RPCI License") to exclusively license from RPCI certain rights to the Panacela Products, including Mobilan and several earlier-stage compounds that are not currently material to our business, and to non-exclusively license from RPCI certain know-how relating to the aforementioned product candidates for the limited purposes of research and development and regulatory, export and other government filings. Additionally, under the Panacela-RPCI License, Panacela has a right to exclusively license from RPCI (i) any technological improvements to the Panacela
 
Products developed by RPCI before September 2016, and (ii) any technology jointly developed by Panacela and RPCI. In consideration for the Panacela-RPCI License, Panacela agreed to issue RPCI common stock and to make certain milestone, royalty and sublicense royalty payments as described below.
 
The Panacela-RPCI License requires milestone payments for developmental and regulatory milestones reached in the U.S. of up to approximately $2.5 million for each Panacela Product that achieves certain developmental and regulatory milestones. Additionally, Panacela will owe additional payments of up to approximately $275,000 for each other country where a licensed Panacela Product achieves similar milestones.
 
The Panacela-RPCI License requires royalty payments on net sales based on percentages in the low single digits. In addition, if Panacela sublicenses any of the licensed Panacela Products, Panacela will owe sublicensing fees ranging from 5% to 15% of any fees received from the sublicensee by Panacela or an affiliate depending upon whether or not an IND has been filed or final approval of the relevant NDA has been obtained for such licensed product.
 
We have also entered into a number of sponsored research agreements with RPCI pursuant to which both parties have sponsored research to be conducted by the other party. Under our sponsored research agreement with RPCI, title to any inventions under the agreement is determined in a manner substantially similar to U.S. patent law, and we have the option to license from RPCI, on an exclusive basis, the right to develop any inventions of RPCI (whether solely or jointly developed) under the agreement for commercial purposes.
 
Under the sponsored research agreements with RPCI, we own any invention that is described in our research plan, co-own any inventions not described in our research plan that are made by Dr. Andrei Gudkov, our Global Head of Research & Development, and RPCI owns any other inventions not described in our research plan. We further have a right to exclusively license from RPCI any invention developed under such sponsored research agreements that are owned by RPCI. Such sponsored research agreements with RPCI expired in 2019.
 
We entered into an asset transfer and clinical trial agreement with RPCI for the conduct, by RPCI, of our Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of entolimod in patients with advanced cancers, which has now been largely completed.
 
Rusnano
 
In 2011, we formed Panacela with Rusnano to carry out a complete cycle of development and commercialization of medications in Russia for the treatment of oncological, infectious or other diseases. We invested $3.0 million in Panacela preferred shares and warrants, and, together with certain third-party owners, assigned and/or exclusively licensed, as applicable, to Panacela worldwide development and commercialization rights to five preclinical product candidates in exchange for Panacela common shares. Rusnano invested $9.0 million in Panacela preferred shares and warrants. In 2013, Rusnano loaned Panacela $1.5 million through a convertible term loan (the "Panacela Loan"). In December of 2015, together with Rusnano, we recapitalized Panacela to fully retire the Panacela Loan and certain other trade payables. Rusnano maintained its ownership percentage in Panacela, while our ownership stake grew to 66.77%. As of December 31, 2021, we owned 67.57% of Panacela's outstanding equity securities.
 
Due to increasing tensions between the United States and Russia resulting from the military engagement in Ukraine and the array of severe economic sanctions being imposed on the Russian government, certain Russian individuals and companies and the Russian financial system, operating Panacela may become increasingly difficult. Accordingly, we may experience delays or impediments in transferring funds to and from Panacela and/or its employees, vendors and contract counterparties. The Company’s management is monitoring the situation and evaluating its options with respect to Panacela

Everon Biosciences
 
On August 6, 2018, we entered into a series of transactions with our joint venture, GPI, and Everon. GPI was formed by the Company to undertake a research and development program aimed at clinical testing of entolimod and GP532 (a variant of our entolimod drug candidate) and to develop medications with anti-aging and other indications associated with genome damage. Under the terms of a license agreement entered into with GPI, we agreed to license to GPI, on an exclusive basis, the right to develop, manufacture, commercialize, and sell products utilizing the Company’s intellectual property underlying the Company’s entolimod drug candidate, solely in the field of use related to the prevention or treatment of any disease, disorder, or frailty in humans caused by aging. Entolimod’s use as an ARS medication is retained by the Company under the license agreement. The intellectual property is licensed pursuant is separate licenses; the license of our intellectual property underlying entolimod’s oncology indication is being licensed on a paid-up, royalty-free basis while the license of our intellectual property underlying entolimod’s composition is being granted on a fee-bearing and royalty-bearing basis, with such fees and royalties comprising those included in the original license agreement pursuant to which we originally licensed such intellectual property from The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, with such fees and royalties payable to The Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
 
Under the license agreement, GPI retains responsibility for its own development and commercialization activities but is required to provide us with access to all clinical, safety, and other data arising from its development activities. We must disclose and transfer all of our know-how pertaining to the licensed intellectual property and provide entolimod product samples to GPI for use in GPI’s clinical trials. The license agreement requires the parties to work together to coordinate efforts between them with respect to regulatory filings, proper reporting of adverse events, the development of standard clinical and quality assurance operating procedures, and the amount of product to be supplied by us to GPI for the conduct of GPI’s development activities.
 
We also entered into an assignment agreement with GPI, under which we assigned certain intellectual property underlying our GP532 product candidate and our entolimod vaccine product candidate and GPI licensed back to us, on an exclusive, irrevocable basis, the right to develop manufacture, commercialize, and sell products relating to the assigned intellectual property for use as a medical countermeasure to treat acute radiation exposure or as a cancer treatment. Under the terms of the assignment, we retain responsibility for our own development and commercialization activities, but GPI is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply to us at no surcharge the number of product samples that it has available for clinical trials that we sponsor and necessary in connection with our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for any drug candidates. The assignment requires us to pay a royalty to GPI of 2% of our net sales of any products covered by or using the assigned intellectual property subject to the license-back in each calendar year beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of any such product until patent protection is no longer available for the assigned intellectual property in the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, or the United Kingdom. We are further required to make payments to GPI upon the achievement of certain milestones in the development of product candidates utilizing the licensed intellectual property.
 
As consideration for the licenses granted to GPI and the assignment of the intellectual property to GPI, GPI issued to the Company 1,000 shares of GPI’s common stock. Contemporaneously with the Company’s entry into the license and assignment, Everon contributed certain of its intellectual property related to the potential development of treatments that address serious medical needs associated with human aging to GPI, also in exchange for 1,000 shares of GPI’s common stock. As a result of each of the Company’s and Everon’s receipt of 1,000 shares of GPI’s common stock, each of the Company and Everon became the owner of 50% of all of the outstanding capital stock of GPI. Additionally, in exchange for providing funding, Norma, a venture capital fund, has the right to acquire shares of GPI’s capital stock in the future. Due to economic sanctions affecting Roman Abramovich, whom we believe was the majority owner or controlling person, directly or indirectly, of Norma, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether this right can or will be exercised, should the conditions for its exercise be satisfied (See "– Product Development Pipeline – Entolimod Oncology Indication"). We currently own 50% of the outstanding capital stock of GPI.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Our intellectual property consists of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and know-how. Our ability to compete effectively depends in large part on our ability to obtain patents for our technologies and products, maintain trade secrets, operate without infringing the rights of others, and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents, or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. As a result, patents or other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business. Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications with claims directed to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical formulations, and methods of use. Some of our issued patents, and the patents that may be issued based on our patent applications, may be eligible for patent life extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 in the U.S., supplementary protection certificates in the European Union ("E.U.") or similar mechanisms in other countries or territories.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we control, through ownership or licenses, approximately 129 issued or allowed patents and patent applications, and 56 additional patents and patent applications filed worldwide that relate to various of our programs. These patents and any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications would expire between 2024 and 2041, excluding patent term extensions.
 
Our policy is to seek patent protection for the inventions that we consider important to the development of our business. We intend to continue to file patent applications to protect technology and compounds that are commercially important to our business, and to do so in countries where we believe it is commercially reasonable and advantageous to do so. We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology where patent protection is deemed inappropriate or unobtainable. We protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators, and contractors.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
As of December 31, 2021, our research and development group was made up of 16 full-time employees.  In addition, in 2021 we used the services of 22 independent contractors, of whom two were based in Russia.
 
Our research and development focuses on management of outsourced preclinical research, clinical trials, and manufacturing technologies. In addition, ImQuest provides services to evaluate the potential of new and novel pharmaceutical products for the treatment and prevention of viruses, bacteria, cancer and inflammatory diseases. ImQuest’s preclinical research services include compound screening to define compound efficacy and drug target validation to define the mechanism of action and toxicity of pharmaceutical products.
 
We invested $11.8 million and $5.3 million in research and development during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
At December 31, 2021 ImQuest had one employee devoted to the marketing and sales of services provided by ImQuest.  Otherwise, we currently do not have marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities. We do, however, currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights for products arising out of substantially all of our programs, as discussed above. In order to commercialize any of these drugs, if and when they are approved for sale, we will need to enter into partnerships for the commercialization of the approved product(s) or develop the necessary marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities.
 
We invested $0.08 million and $0.01 million in sales and marketing during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
COMPETITION
 
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition. This competition comes from both biotechnology firms and major pharmaceutical companies. Mergers and acquisition activity in the biopharmaceutical sector is likely to result in greater resource concentration among a smaller number of our competitors. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, and human resources than we do, including, in some cases, considerably more experience in clinical testing, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products. In addition, many small biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to (i) obtain support for their research, development and commercialization of products or (ii) combine several treatment approaches to develop longer lasting or more efficacious treatments that may potentially directly compete with our current or future product candidates. There are also academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other research organizations that are conducting research in areas in which we are working. They may also develop products that may be competitive with our product candidates, either on their own or through collaborative
 efforts. 
 
We expect to encounter significant competition for any products we develop. Our product candidates’ competitive position among other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies will be based on, among other things, time to market, patent position, efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, patient convenience, ease of delivery, manufacturing cost, and price. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if one or more of our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, better tolerated, or of greater convenience or economic benefit than our proposed product offerings. Our competitors also may be in a position to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly, resulting in a stronger or dominant market position before we are able to enter the market. In these cases, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market which could materially and adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
Companies that we are aware of with targeted immune-stimulating therapeutics in the treatment of autoimmune, neutropenia/anemia, emerging viruses and/or cancers include Amgen, Sanofi-Aventis, J&J, Partner therapeutics, and a number of other development stage companies , which have product candidates in various stages of preclinical and clinical developments. Specific competition for entolimod includes FDA-approved drugs filgrastim (Neupogen™) peg-filgrastim (Neulasta™), sargramostim (Leukine®) and romiplostim (NPLATE®) for Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome (HS-ARS). In addition, we are aware of a number of companies also developing radiation countermeasures to treat the effects of ARS including: Aeolus Pharmaceuticals, Araim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cellerant Therapeutics, Inc., Humanetics Corporation, Neumedicines, Inc., Pluristem Therapeutics, Inc, RxBio, Inc., and Soligenix, Inc. 
 
Additionally, our ability to sell to the government also can be influenced by competition from the products, such as Neupogen®, Neulasta®, Leukine®, and NPLATE® which were previously purchased by the U.S. government for the National Stockpile.

MANUFACTURING
 
Our product candidates are peptides, biologics, and small molecules that can be synthesized by processes that we have developed. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates for preclinical, clinical, or commercial quantities. We rely on third-party manufacturers, and in most cases only one third-party, to manufacture critical raw materials, drug substance and final drug product for our research, preclinical development, and clinical trial activities. Commercial quantities of any drugs we seek to develop will have to be manufactured in facilities and by processes that comply with the FDA and other regulations, and we plan to rely on third parties to manufacture commercial quantities of products we successfully develop.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Government authorities in the U.S. and in other countries regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, quality control, labeling, and export and import of pharmaceutical products such as those that we are developing. We cannot provide assurance that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe or effective, will receive regulatory approvals, or will be successfully commercialized.
 
Approval and Regulation of Drugs in the United States
 
In the United States, drug products are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA") and applicable implementing regulations and guidance. The failure of an applicant to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including non-clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or the post-approval process, may result in delays to the conduct of a study. In rare instances involving willful or exceptionally negligent conduct on the part of a company it could result in civil or criminal penalties.
 
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps before the FDA will consider approving the product candidate: preclinical testing including laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations and standards;
 

● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB") representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application ("NDA") for a drug product which includes not only the results of the clinical trials
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 
Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
 
The IND and IRB Processes
 
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. IND authorization is required by FDA before the commencement of any human or animal studies for phased development.
 
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a partial clinical hold might state that a specific protocol or part of a protocol may not proceed, while other parts of a protocol or other protocols may do so.
 
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all IND requirements must be met unless waived by the FDA. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Foreign studies are expected to be conducted within the conditions laid out by FDA for GCPs.
 
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
 
Expanded access, sometimes called "compassionate use," is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application.
 
On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended) a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policies for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect. This provision requires drug and biologic companies to make publicly available their policies for expanded access for individual patient access to products intended for serious diseases. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study with respect to an investigational drug; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval.
 
Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the product candidate’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
 
Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well-controlled and closely monitored.
 
Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a drug. Such Phase 3 clinical trials are referred to as "pivotal" trials.
 
In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of FDA approval for products.

Review and Approval of an NDA
 
In order to obtain approval to market a drug product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides sufficient data establishing the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate for its intended indication. The application must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product candidate’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of the use of a product candidate, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 
The NDA is a vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new drug product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2021 is $2,875,842 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2021 is $336,432. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as a waiver for certain small businesses filing their first NDA.
 
Following submission of an NDA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the requested additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
 
Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
 
Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products of which there is a shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report.
 
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is an NME.
 
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations
 
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as Fast Track Designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation.
 
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 
Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from 10 months to six months.
 
With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act (the "Cures Act") in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies and potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.

Accelerated Approval Pathway
 
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval to a product for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
 
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect of the product on the relevant clinical endpoints. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of an NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after the initiation of commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, such as REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs.
 
After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
    13 

  

Post-Approval Regulation
 
If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or a new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements.
 
Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
 
A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters, untitled letters, Form 483s or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information.
 
If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.

Animal Rule
 
In 2002, the FDA amended its requirements applicable to BLAs/NDAs to permit the approval of certain drugs and biologics that are intended to reduce or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of safety from clinical trial(s) in healthy subjects and effectiveness from appropriate animal studies when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. These regulations, which are known as the "Animal Rule", authorize the FDA to rely on animal studies to provide evidence of a product’s effectiveness under circumstances where there is a reasonably well-understood mechanism for the activity of the agent. Under these requirements, and with the FDA’s prior agreement, drugs used to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear substances may be approved for use in humans based on evidence of effectiveness derived from appropriate animal studies and any additional supporting data. Products evaluated under this rule must demonstrate effectiveness through pivotal animal studies, which are generally equivalent in design and robustness to Phase 3 clinical studies.
 
We intend to utilize the Animal Rule in seeking marketing approval for entolimod as a medical radiation countermeasure because we cannot ethically expose humans to lethal doses of radiation. Other countries may not at this time have established criteria for review and approval of these types of products outside their normal review process, i.e. there is no "Animal Rule" equivalent in countries other than the U.S., but some may have similar policy objectives in place for these product candidates
 
Emergency Use Authorization
 
The Commissioner of the FDA, under delegated authority from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("DHHS") may, under certain circumstances, issue an Emergency Use Authorization ("EUA") that would permit the use of an unapproved drug product or unapproved use of an approved drug product.
 
In order to be the subject of an EUA, the FDA Commissioner must conclude that, based on the totality of scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating or preventing a disease attributable to the agents described above, that the product’s potential benefits outweigh its potential risks and that there is no adequate approved alternative to the product.
 
Although an EUA cannot be issued until after an emergency has been declared by the Secretary of DHHS, the FDA strongly encourages an entity with a possible candidate product, particularly one at an advanced stage of development, to contact the FDA center responsible for the candidate product before a determination of actual or potential emergency.
 
The Company submitted a pre-EUA in 2015 in order to inform and expedite the FDA’s issuance of an EUA, should one become necessary in the event of an emergency. On May 27, 2021, we received a response from the FDA relating to our Pre-EUA submission for entolimod. In its response, the FDA indicated that additional information was required to meet the criteria for a potential Emergency Use Authorization. In order to meet the submission criteria, the FDA stated that it would need additional data to determine an effective dose for clinical use and would require additional efficacy information. The FDA will require additional clinical studies to evaluate this information. The Company will continue to work with the FDA to determine the necessary next steps and clinical studies requested to demonstrate efficacy and safety for a EUA. There is no guarantee that the FDA will ultimately agree that entolimod meets the criteria for EUA, or, if they do agree, that such agreement by the FDA will lead to procurement by the U.S. or other governments or further development funding.
 
Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act
 
The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (the "PREP Act"), provides immunity for manufacturers from all claims under state or federal law for "loss" arising out of the administration or use of a "covered countermeasure." However, injured persons may still bring a suit for "willful misconduct" against the manufacturer under some circumstances. "Covered countermeasures" include security countermeasures and "qualified pandemic or epidemic products", including products intended to diagnose or treat pandemic or epidemic disease, such as pandemic vaccines, as well as treatments intended to address conditions caused by such products.
Orphan Drug
 
Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, as amended by the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a "rare disease or condition," which is defined as having a prevalence of less than 200,000 individuals in the United States. FDA is currently implementing a modernization plan which may include new requirements or procedures that could impact the success of an orphan drug designation request. In certain circumstances, a sponsor may need to demonstrate that the product is clinically superior to a previously-approved drug in order to obtain orphan drug status, and FDA may issue regulations to implement this requirement. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a NDA or BLA for the product. The FDA aims to respond to all orphan drug designation requests within 90 days of submission. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the regulatory review and approval process, nor does it provide any advantage in the regulatory review and approval process. However, if an orphan drug later receives approval for the indication for which it has designation, the relevant regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years in the United States.

Hatch-Waxman Act Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

● | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent is invalid, is unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
 
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earliest of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent and a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of an NCE, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earliest of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit and a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to submitting the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. In addition, certain products that have received orphan drug designation are exempt from the requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003.
 
The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established requirements governing certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits an NDA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the NDA if the drug is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary efficacy to inform pediatric labeling for the product.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half of the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.

Health Care Law and Regulation
 
Health care providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations include the following:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability, private litigation and/or adverse publicity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to health care items or services that are reimbursed by non-government third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Healthcare Reform
 
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives to broaden the availability of healthcare, improve the quality of healthcare and contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was enacted in the United States, which made a number of substantial changes in the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other ways in which it may affect the Company’s business, the ACA:
 
In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which significantly changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following:
 

● | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Since its passage, there have been political, legislative and judicial challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. During his time in office, President Trump signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements of the ACA, but those orders were revoked on January 28, 2021 under a new executive order signed by President Biden, who has signaled that his Administration plans to build on the ACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it. As part of that policy, he has directed federal agencies to begin reviewing and possibly rescinding all regulations, orders and policies, which are inconsistent with the goal of strengthening the ACA. Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. For example, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the "individual mandate." On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire ACA. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard arguments on the case on November 10, 2020. A ruling is expected in 2021. If the Supreme Court rules that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and unable to be severed from the remainder of the ACA, the remaining provisions of the ACA would be invalid. It is unclear how this case, along with other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and the Company’s business.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. Specifically, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was created to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that will, due to subsequent legislative amendments, remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the CARES Act, the 2% Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 
It is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace the ACA would take, and how or whether it may affect the Company’s business in the future. We expect that changes to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.
 
There will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices the Company will be able to charge and/or patients’ willingness to pay for the Company’s products. While in general it is too early to predict what effect, if any, any future healthcare reform legislation or policies will have on the Company’s business, current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial condition.

General Data Protection Regulation
 
The collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data of individuals in the European Union, including personal health data, is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing notice to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the Company’s cost of doing business. Further, Great Britain’s exit from the European Union has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the UK and how transfers from the EU to the UK will be regulated.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
As of March 25, 2022, Statera and its consolidated subsidiaries had 46 employees, 42 of whom are located in the U.S. There were no persons employed on a part-time basis. 35% of those employees were predominantly engaged in research and development and clinical study support activities and 65% were engaged in business activities from finance, legal, business development, human resources, facilities, or other general and administrative functions. None of the employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the Company has not experienced any work stoppages. Statera Biopharma considers its relationship with its employees to be good.
ENVIRONMENT
 
We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures for environmental compliance and protection. Expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position.
