Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage gene therapy company targeting unmet medical needs in serious rare and ocular diseases. Leveraging our next-generation adeno-associated virus (“AAV”)-based directed evolution platform, we generate gene therapy product candidates designed to provide durable efficacy by inducing sustained expression of a therapeutic protein. Our core capabilities include clinical development and in-house manufacturing expertise, specifically in process development, assay development, and current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) quality control. Our leadership team has significant drug development and gene therapy expertise.
 We are advancing our robust pipeline of gene therapy product candidates designed to treat rare diseases, alpha-1 antitrypsin (“A1AT”) deficiency and hereditary angioedema (“HAE”), as well as wet age-related macular degeneration (“wAMD”). Our pipeline of lead and partnered gene therapy programs is shown below. 
 

For the treatment of A1AT deficiency, we are advancing our gene therapy product candidate ADVM-043, AAVrh.10-A1AT, in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial (the “ADVANCE trial”). The ADVANCE trial is a multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability and secondary endpoints include changes in plasma concentrations of both total and M-specific A1AT levels. The study will include up to 20 patients across up to four planned dosing cohorts of up to 5 patients each. The first three cohorts of patients will receive a single intravenous (“IV”) administration of ADVM-043 and the fourth cohort of patients will receive a single intrapleural (“IP”) administration of ADVM-043. In the first cohort, patients (n=2) have been dosed and evaluated following a single administration of ADVM-043 at a dose of ~1E12 vg/kg (8E13 total vg). Based on a review of the preliminary safety data, the independent data monitoring committee (“DMC”) has recommended escalating to the intermediate dose (~5E12 vg/kg (4E14 total vg) of ADVM-043, which will be utilized in the second cohort of patients, which is open for enrollment. Further details about the study can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov under trial identifier number NCT02168686. We expect to report preliminary data from this trial in the second half of 2018.

* Based on an 80kg patient 
 ADVM-043 is designed as a potential single-administration treatment to induce stable, long-term A1AT protein levels, or expression. In a preclinical proof-of-concept study, ADVM-043 demonstrated robust protein expression above therapeutic levels in mice following either IV or IP administration. In another study in non-human primates, evidence of stable long-term expression of hA1AT was observed out to one year following IP administration of ADVM-043.
 For treatment of the rare disease HAE, we are advancing our preclinical gene therapy product candidate ADVM-053, AAVrh.10-C1EI. ADVM-053 is designed as a potential single-administration treatment to provide sustained expression of the C1 esterase inhibitor (“C1EI”) protein to eliminate protein level variability and to prevent breakthrough edema attacks. In preclinical studies, a single IV administration of ADVM-053 increased C1EI protein expression above therapeutic levels and decreased vascular permeability. We plan to submit an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for ADVM-053 for HAE with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the second half of 2018.
 For wAMD, we are advancing our preclinical gene therapy product candidate ADVM-022, AAV.7m8-aflibercept. Comprising a proprietary vector capsid (“AAV.7m8”) and a proprietary expression cassette, ADVM-022 is administered as a single intravitreal injection and is designed to minimize the treatment burden of anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (“VEGF”) injections, which is the current standard of care for treatment of wAMD. We have presented preclinical proof-of-concept data of ADVM-022’s anti-angiogenic effect in the laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (“CNV”) model in non-human primates (“NHP”), the industry standard for testing new wAMD therapies. The data from a single injection of ADVM-022 showed efficacy that was comparable to the anti-VEGF standard of care, which was used as positive control in the CNV study. At scientific meetings in September 2017, we presented additional long-term data, which continued to demonstrate sustained expression of anti-VEGF protein following a single intravitreal injection of ADVM-022. Pharmacokinetic data on one non-human primate demonstrated sustained expression for 52 weeks. In a separate ongoing study, sustained expression for at least seven months has been observed in seven non-human primates. In this ongoing preclinical study, we continue to assess the durability of protein expression in non-human primates and expect to report 12-month efficacy data in the NHP CNV model in the first half of 2018. We plan to submit an IND application for ADVM-022 for wAMD with the FDA in the second half of 2018.
 Our earlier-stage research programs include gene therapy product candidates targeting cardiomyopathy associated with Friedreich’s ataxia (“FA”) and severe allergy.
 Our partnered programs include vectors we are developing under collaboration agreements. Under an agreement with Editas Medicine, Inc. (“Editas”) we are leveraging our AAV-vectors for use with Editas’ leading Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (“CRISPR”)-based genome editing technologies to treat up to five inherited retinal diseases. Our agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Regeneron”) provides for development of up to eight distinct ocular therapeutic targets, and includes AVA-311 for the treatment of juvenile X-Linked Retinoschisis (“XLRS”).

On May 11, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Annapurna Therapeutics SAS (“Annapurna”), a privately-held French gene therapy company, (the “Annapurna acquisition”) and, as a result, Annapurna became our wholly-owned subsidiary. At the closing of the Annapurna acquisition, we issued 14,087,246 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Annapurna, and the outstanding stock options or other rights to purchase capital stock of Annapurna were exchanged for our stock options or other rights to purchase capital stock of our common stock.
 We changed our name from “Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc.” to “Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc.” upon completion of the Annapurna acquisition.
 Our Strengths
 We believe we have the capabilities, resources, and expertise to enable Adverum to become a leading gene therapy company. These strengths include:
  
• | industry-leading capabilities in AAV technology;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | a robust pipeline of gene therapy product candidates targeting the treatment of serious rare and ocular diseases;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a robust patent portfolio;
--+---------------------------


• | proprietary vectors; and
--+-------------------------


• | an experienced leadership team with expertise in developing gene therapies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to discover, develop, and commercialize novel gene therapies with the potential to treat patients living with serious rare diseases or diseases of the eye. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to: 

• | Target large patient populations impacted by wAMD and well-established orphan indications offering significant market potential. For wAMD, there are an estimated 1.2 million individuals in the U.S. and 3 million on a worldwide basis living with this disease, and the incidence of new cases is expected to continue to grow significantly from an aging population. The standard-of-care therapies generated approximately $9.2 billion in sales in 2017. For A1AT deficiency, approximately 100,000 individuals in the U.S. are affected. The therapeutic market for patients with A1AT deficiency was estimated at approximately $575 million in the U.S., $700 million in North America, and $1.2 billion worldwide in 2016. For HAE, there are approximately 8,000 individuals in the U.S. impacted by this disease. The therapeutic market for HAE was approximately $1.7 billion worldwide in 2016.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Address unmet needs in serious rare and ocular diseases. Our gene therapies are designed as single-administration treatments to address the unmet needs of patients with serious rare and ocular diseases. Currently, patients living with A1AT deficiency, HAE and wAMD are treated with therapies that require frequent IV, subcutaneous injection (“SQ”), or intravitreal administration and have significant limitations. As an example, for patients with emphysema due to A1AT deficiency, the current standard-of-care treatment is weekly IV infusions of A1AT. This treatment regimen can be difficult for patients to comply with and underdosing can lead to worsening lung function. For HAE, the current standard-of-care treatment is IV or SQ infusions of C1EI 2-3 times a week, which offer limited efficacy as patients can still have breakthrough attacks, which can be fatal. For wAMD, the current standard-of-care treatment requires patients to receive intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF proteins every 4-8 weeks, which can be difficult for patients to comply with and leads to loss of vision from underdosing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue indications with well-defined clinical and regulatory paths to mitigate the risk of the development of our novel gene therapies. We have selected indications that have prior clinical validation, including established endpoints, and defined regulatory paths. For example, in A1AT deficiency, published clinical data demonstrate the correlation of patients’ serum A1AT protein levels with the risk for emphysema, and four plasma derived protein products have been approved by the FDA based on demonstrating an increase in the A1AT protein levels. Similarly, data show that augmenting serum A1AT protein levels can slow the loss of lung parenchyma. In HAE, there are several therapies approved for routine prophylaxis on the basis of reducing breakthrough attacks by elevating C1-esterase inhibitor levels to an established threshold. For wAMD, anti-VEGF proteins are the approved standard-of-care, and our gene therapy utilizes a proprietary vector designed to deliver an anti-VEGF protein through an intravitreal injection.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accelerate the clinical development of our pipeline of gene therapies toward near-term milestones. To accelerate the development of our pipeline, we are executing our clinical and regulatory plans to have three gene therapy programs in the clinic in the near term. We are advancing ADVM-043 for the treatment of patients with A1AT deficiency in the ADVANCE trial, which began patient dosing in December 2017. We expect to report preliminary data from the ADVANCE trial in the second half of 2018. For ADVM-022 for wAMD, we are conducting IND-enabling studies as well as an ongoing preclinical study to assess the durability of protein expression in non-human primates and long-term efficacy of ADVM-022 in the laser induced CNV model in NHPs. We expect to report the 12-month efficacy data in the first half of

2018. In addition, we plan to submit an IND application for ADVM 022 for wAMD with the FDA in the second half of 2018. For ADVM-053 for HAE, IND-enabling studies are ongoing and we also plan to submit an IND application with the FDA in the second half of 2018.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance our earlier-stage research initiatives and leverage our industry-leading capabilities in novel vector development. We plan to continue to leverage our next-generation AAV-based directed evolution platform to engineer AAV capsid and discover novel vectors with potential enhanced tropism for certain tissues and/or improved antibody neutralization profile over currently existing AAV variants. Combining our vectorology and manufacturing expertise, we have the capability to generate large amounts of high-throughput recombinant AAV capsid libraries that can be screened in large animals rather than rodents in order to maximize chances of applicability to human subjects. We are also focused on discovering improved ubiquitous and cell-specific promoters and expression cassettes to offer optimal transgene expression target tissue. We plan to use this expertise to expand our pipeline and manage and potentially extend the life cycle of our novel gene therapies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collaborate with partners to leverage our industry-leading AAV vector expertise and ophthalmic vector development and product delivery capabilities. Under a collaboration agreement with Editas Medicine, we are leveraging our proprietary AAV vectors for use with Editas’ leading CRISPR-based genome editing technologies to treat up to five inherited retinal diseases. Our collaboration agreement with Regeneron provides for the development of up to eight distinct ocular therapeutic targets and, includes AVA-311 for the treatment of juvenile XLRS. We plan to continue to explore ways to work collaboratively with these and potential new partners who may benefit from our capabilities and expertise in AAV vector development and product delivery.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prepare manufacturing capabilities for late-stage clinical trials and commercialization. We plan to begin the initial stage of investing in a manufacturing facility to build on our internal process development capabilities. Our in-house manufacturing process is based on the Baculovirus/Sf9 production system, which has been used for a number of FDA and EMA-approved products and is capable of producing large quantities of AAVs. Currently, we utilize our process development capabilities to deliver scalable processes to GMP contract manufacturers. As we prepare for larger, late-stage clinical trials and potential commercialization, we plan to invest in stages in a manufacturing facility to meet our product production requirements.

Gene Therapy Background 
 Gene therapy is a powerful treatment modality to address disease biology in a targeted and efficient way. With gene therapy, affected individuals are administered vectors encoding therapeutic genes, expressing for example the functional version of a mutated protein (e.g., A1AT or C1EI) or a therapeutic protein (e.g. anti-VEGF). Instead of providing proteins or other therapies externally and dosing them over a long period, gene therapy offers the possibility of dosing once, or a very limited number of times, to achieve a long-term, durable benefit. Once a patient’s cells have incorporated the therapeutic gene, the cells are potentially able to continue to produce the therapeutic protein for years.
 Similar to existing classes of protein or biologic therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and drug-antibody conjugates, gene therapy has taken a number of years to evolve from a research tool into a viable and compelling treatment modality. There have been several recent advances in gene therapy, including the following:
  
• | Compelling clinical data. Positive data from gene therapy clinical trials have been reported in a variety of indications, including adrenoleukodystrophy, beta-thalassemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia, hemophilia, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, HIV infection and Parkinson’s disease, as well as several ophthalmic diseases including biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy, Choroideremia and Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased investment by biopharmaceutical companies. The modality of gene therapy has been further validated by growing interest and investments by biopharmaceutical companies. Large, global biopharmaceutical companies, such as BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Biogen Idec Inc., Celgene Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Novartis, Sanofi, Regeneron and Shire Pharmaceuticals Group Plc, have increased their investment in the gene therapy field. Additionally, pure-play gene therapy companies, such as Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Audentes Therapeutics, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., REGENXBIO Inc. (“REGENXBIO”), Spark Therapeutics, Inc., uniQure N.V. and Voyager Therapeutics, have attracted recent investment in this growing field.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval of gene therapy products by regulatory authorities. The FDA recently approved its first AAV vector-based gene therapy product, LUXTURNA™ (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) for the treatment of patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy.

Our Novel AAV Vector Discovery and Optimization System
 Our next-generation discovery platform is based on vectors derived from AAV, which is a small, non-pathogenic virus, encoding a therapeutic DNA instead of the viral protein genes. The resulting vector is used to deliver a functional gene into a desired cell population, which when expressed, will result in continuous protein production. We believe AAV vectors offer numerous advantages over other viral and non-viral vector technologies used for gene therapy. These advantages, highlighted below, have the potential to allow AAVs to be safe, to be applicable for a variety of indications and to exhibit long-term efficacy.

• | Highly-efficient transfer of DNA. AAV vectors offer highly-efficient transfer of DNA to the patient.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-pathogenic. Parental AAV virus is not known to cause any disease in humans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-replicating. Parental AAV virus is naturally replication deficient. Once inside the host cell, AAV vectors do not replicate, and cannot spread.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Long-term expression. Once incorporated into the host cell, AAV vectors can continue to drive expression of a therapeutic protein for years. This may avoid the need for frequent treatments, that are the standard of care for the treatment of A1AT deficiency, HAE and wAMD.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low-integrating potential. AAV vector genomes remain mainly as a stable non-integrated episome in the host cell nucleus, mitigating the risk of potential safety concerns.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low inflammatory potential. Compared to other vectors used in direct gene therapy approaches, AAV vectors elicit only mild inflammatory reactions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to transduce non-dividing cells. AAV vectors are able to efficiently transduce non-dividing cells or slow-dividing cells such as retinal cells and hepatocytes which allow production of the therapeutic protein at the site of the disease (wAMD) or its natural organ of production (A1AT).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tested in humans. AAV vectors have been used safely in more than 130 gene therapy trials to date.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 AAV is naturally occurring and has become a leading vector used in gene therapy. According to the Journal of Gene Medicine, AAV has been used in over 130 clinical trials as of August 2016. The most frequently studied variant of AAV is AAV2, which can preferentially infect a number of cell types, including those found in the retina.
 As effective as existing AAV vectors are in gene therapy, we believe there is an opportunity to advance vector capabilities beyond those currently available. Naturally occurring AAV variants have evolved with particular characteristics, some of which pose limitations to their use in gene therapy.
 In order to create next-generation vectors, we use a multi-step process known as directed evolution. Our directed evolution technology uses a library of engineered AAV capsid genes, which exhibit different properties and capabilities than naturally occurring AAVs. Once we have created an initial pool of millions of different AAVs, each with distinct genetic and chemical composition, we screen the AAVs in the pool for novel properties, e.g., specific transduction of a particular cell type of interest or the capability to evade pre-existing neutralizing immune response. After isolating engineered capsids with potentially desirable properties from the target tissue, a smaller pool of optimized vectors from this screening process is further generated and screened until we have identified a select number of engineered AAVs with the characteristics we seek.
 Our Product Candidates
 We have a pipeline of gene therapy product candidates in development for the treatment of patients with serious rare and ocular diseases.
 ADVM-043 for Treatment of A1AT Deficiency
 Market for A1AT Deficiency
 A1AT deficiency is an orphan disease affecting approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States (the “U.S.”). The disease is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, resulting in very low levels of A1AT. A1AT deficiency is associated with the development of emphysema and premature death.
 The market for A1AT deficiency therapy was approximately $575 million in the U.S., $700 million in North America and $1.2 billion worldwide in 2016. The current standard-of-care treatment for patients with this disease who have developed emphysema includes weekly IV infusions of a plasma derived A1AT, at an estimated cost of $100,000 annually per patient. This current treatment regimen is burdensome and can result in underdosing, which in turn can lead to worsening lung function.
 7


Our Approach for A1AT Deficiency
 ADVM-043 is our gene therapy candidate that has the potential to induce stable, long-term A1AT protein expression. In a preclinical proof-of-concept study, ADVM-043 demonstrated robust protein expression in mice, with protein levels 2.5 times above normal levels of A1AT. Data showed that hA1AT was present in the serum following either IV or IP administration of ADVM-043. In another study in non-human primates, evidence of stable long-term expression of hA1AT was observed out to one year following IP administration of ADVM-043.
 ADVM-043 utilizes AAVrh.10, a vector selected based on peer-reviewed published research which compared 25 different vectors used in the lung showing superiority of protein expression from AAVrh.10 over other serotypes. In addition, AAVrh.10 has been shown to transduce the liver, which is the organ that naturally produces A1AT with high efficiency. Our biodistribution and preclinical data on this vector lead us to believe there is potential for AAVrh.10-A1AT, when administered intravenously, to provide therapeutic levels of A1AT.
 We are advancing ADVM-043 in the ADVANCE trial in A1AT deficiency patients and we expect to report preliminary data from this trial in the second half of 2018.
 
ADVM-053 for Treatment of HAE
 
Market for HAE
 
HAE is an orphan disease affecting approximately 8,000 individuals in the U.S. This disease is caused by a genetic mutation that results in low levels of C1EI. Low C1EI levels can be associated with sudden swelling and edema of respiratory airways, gastrointestinal tract, and extremities.
 The current standard-of-care prophylaxis treatment regimen generally requires IV infusions or subcutaneous injections of C1EI 2-3 times a week, at an estimated cost of $0.5 million – $0.6 million annually per patient in the U.S. This treatment regimen can be burdensome for patients and their caregivers, and patients may still experience breakthrough edema attacks despite treatment. 
 A prior study demonstrated that patients treated with more frequent infusions of C1EI can significantly decrease and, in some patients, eliminate breakthrough attacks. However, a daily infusion treatment regimen is not clinically practical and, therefore, there is an unmet medical need for sustained C1EI delivery to patients in order to prevent breakthrough edema attacks.
 
Our Approach for HAE
 
ADVM-053 is our preclinical gene therapy product candidate that has the potential to be a prophylactic treatment of HAE. ADVM-053 is designed to be administered as a single IV injection to prevent HAE attacks.
 ADVM-053 also utilizes an AAVrh.10-based vector, which has been shown to target the liver, which is the natural source of C1EI. In prior preclinical studies, a single IV administration of ADVM-053 showed robust C1EI protein expression. In a proof-of-concept study, ADVM-053 increased C1EI protein expression above anticipated therapeutic levels. An additional study, in a mouse model of the disease, demonstrated that ADVM-053 decreased vascular permeability.
 We are advancing ADVM-053 for HAE and plan to submit an IND with the FDA in the second half of 2018.
 ADVM-022 for Treatment of wAMD
 Market for wAMD
 Age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”) is a progressive disease affecting the retinal cells in the macula, the region of the eye responsible for central vision. Disease progression results in the death of retinal cells and the gradual loss of vision. 
 Approximately 10% of patients living with AMD have an advanced form of the disease called wAMD, in which blood vessels begin to invade the cellular space between layers of cells in the retina. These new blood vessels are often leaky, which results in fluid and blood in the retina and causes vision loss.
 8


wAMD is a leading cause of vision loss in subjects over 60 years of age. A significant number of individuals are impacted by this disease, which has a prevalence of approximately 1.2 million individuals in the U.S. and 3 million on a worldwide basis. The incidence of new cases of wAMD in the U.S. is approximately 150,000 to 200,000 annually, and this number is expected to grow significantly based on the country’s aging population.
 Although the underlying molecular causes of AMD are not completely known, VEGF is known to play a central role in the growth of new blood vessels in wAMD. The standard-of-care therapies for wAMD include Lucentis® and EYLEA®, which together generated annual sales of approximately $9.2 billion in 2017, in addition to off-label use of Avastin®. 
  
• | Lucentis, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds to and inhibits VEGF proteins in the eye, was approved in the U.S. in 2006 and in Europe in 2007. In 2017, Lucentis achieved worldwide sales of approximately $3.3 billion.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EYLEA, a recombinant fusion protein containing portions of the human VEGF receptors that binds to VEGF, was approved in the U.S. in 2011. EYLEA has exhibited strong adoption in the market due to its more convenient dosing regimen compared to Lucentis and in 2017, EYLEA® achieved worldwide sales of approximately $5.9 billion.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Avastin is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF and is approved as an anti-cancer agent. Avastin is widely prescribed off-label in ophthalmic diseases such as wAMD and makes up approximately 60% of the wAMD market by volume.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The current treatment regimen can be burdensome, as patients generally require intravitreal injections with anti-VEGF proteins every 4-8 weeks. Compliance with this regimen can be difficult for patients and their caregivers, leading to compliance deficiencies and loss of vision from underdosing.
 Our Approach for wAMD
 ADVM-022 is our preclinical gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of wAMD. With AAV.7m8 and a proprietary expression cassette, ADVM-022 is administered as a single intravitreal injection and is designed to minimize the treatment burden of the standard of care frequent injections. At scientific meetings, we have presented preclinical proof-of-concept data of ADVM-022’s anti-angiogenic effect in the laser-induced CNV model in non-human primates, the industry standard for testing new wAMD therapies. The data from a single injection of ADVM-022 showed efficacy that was comparable to the anti-VEGF standard of care, which was the positive control in the CNV model. We presented additional long-term data at scientific meetings in September 2017, which continued to demonstrate sustained expression of anti-VEGF protein following a single intravitreal injection of ADVM-022. Pharmacokinetic data on one non-human primate demonstrated sustained expression for 52 weeks. In a separate ongoing study, sustained expression for at least seven months has been observed in seven non-human primates. In this ongoing preclinical study, we continue to assess the durability of protein expression in non-human primates and expect to report 12-month efficacy data for ADVM-022 in the laser induced CNV model in the first half of 2018. 
 We are advancing ADVM-022 and plan to submit an IND application with the FDA in the second half of 2018.
 GenSight Biologics has also obtained a license from us to use AAV.7m8 for GS030 gene therapy encoding channelrhodopsin protein. GenSight has received MHRA approval to initiate a Phase 1/2 trial in retinitis pigmentosa, which is expected to begin in 2018.
 Other Preclinical Product Candidates 
 
In addition to our lead programs, we are developing a gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with FA, a debilitating neurodegenerative disease resulting in poor coordination of legs and arms, progressive loss of the ability to walk, generalized weakness, loss of sensation, scoliosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy as well as impaired vision, hearing and speech. It affects approximately 5,000 people in the U.S. and approximately 5,000 to 10,000 people in Europe. Currently, we are conducting observational studies and are in the early stages of preclinical development.
Manufacturing 
 Our AAV vector manufacturing process is based on the Baculovirus Expression Vector System (“BEVS”), which has been used in a number of FDA- and EMA-approved products. This approach is well suited for the production of large quantities of AAVs, as it takes advantage of the efficiency of viral infection coupled with the high density and scalability of insect cells grown in serum-free suspension cultures. Compared to the mammalian cell-based approaches commonly used in the field, our manufacturing process is designed to produce higher yields of vectors per manufacturing campaign in a cost-effective manner.
 9


Our BEVS manufacturing process, using the eye as an example, is presented in the figure below.
  
1) | The process begins with two DNA constructs, one encoding the therapeutic protein and the other encoding AAV helper components for the AAV capsid and replication of vectors.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Each DNA construct is inserted into the genome of a baculovirus to create two types of recombinant baculoviruses.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | The two baculoviruses are used to transduce Sf9 insect cells, which in turn produce large amounts of AAV vectors containing the therapeutic gene of interest.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | The transduced Sf9 insect cells are then harvested and treated with a lysis buffer solution to burst the insect cells and release the AAV vectors.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | Recovered AAV vectors are then purified to remove unwanted debris.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------


6) | Following purification, the vectors are formulated in a physiological solution and placed in vials.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7) | The resulting drug product is ready for use as a therapeutic treatment for the targeted disease (e.g., injection in the eye to treat wAMD).
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BEVS Manufacturing Process
 

Our AAV manufacturing method is industrialized, highly scalable and ready for adaptation for commercial stage. We believe our process provides the following advantages over competing systems:

• | Industrial-scale biologics production. Our BEVS system can produce quantities of product required at commercial stage by incorporating scalable, well-established process steps used throughout the industry for biologic products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety advantages. Our BEVS system does not use mammalian cell cultures or tumorigenic cell lines, and the DNA sequences used to allow AAV vector production are inactive in mammalian cells, which lowers the risk of off-target expression from our products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High yield and low cost. Because of its scalability, our BEVS system allows the production of large quantities of AAV vectors up to one hundred times greater per manufacturing campaign than those obtained using conventional AAV production systems. This lowers the unit cost of goods and may enable us to meet global demand for large markets, such as wAMD.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High purity. Our BEVS system coupled with our proprietary downstream purification process produces a highly pure drug substance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Precedent regulatory framework. Several FDA- and EMA-approved vaccines and gene therapy products including FluBlok, Cervarix and Glybera are manufactured using similar BEVS technology.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our products are manufactured using proprietary cell banks and a scalable process developed internally that is transferred to approved Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMOs”). These CMOs produce investigational drugs under cGMP conditions to support our clinical trials. Raw materials of highest quality are purchased from various suppliers and are used throughout the manufacturing process. 
 
We have entered into a manufacturing technology license agreement pursuant to which we and Lonza Houston, Inc. are assessing certain technology potentially useful for the manufacture of our products. The license agreement provides that the parties will conduct activities to evaluate such technology and that we may elect to engage Lonza to manufacture our products. We also granted to Lonza certain licenses to practice the manufacturing technology for products other than those being developed by us, our affiliates or sublicensees. 
 We continue to evaluate new raw material suppliers as well as CMOs with available manufacturing slots in order to provide manufacturing flexibility. As we prepare for larger, late-stage clinical trials and potential commercialization, we plan to begin the initial stage of investing in a manufacturing facility to build on our internal process development capabilities. 
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our AAV-based directed evolution platform, single-administration gene therapy candidates, and expertise in the field of gene therapy provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions.
 Our wAMD gene therapy ADVM-022 utilizes a proprietary vector and is administered through an intravitreal injection and will compete with a variety of therapies currently marketed and in development, including biologics, small molecules and gene therapy. Existing anti-VEGF therapies, Lucentis, EYLEA and Avastin, are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers as the standard-of-care treatment of patients with wAMD. To date, we are not aware of any treatment that has demonstrated a better benefit to patients than regular anti-VEGF protein delivery.
 We know of a significant number of product candidates in development for wAMD, and we group them into four main categories:
  
• | biosimilar anti-VEGFs
--+----------------------


• | combination / add-on therapy for efficacy improvement (for example, Anti-angiopoietin-2)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | next generation anti-VEGF with quarterly injection
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | long acting delivery device / gene therapy to lower treatment frequency
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There are several other companies with marketed products or products in development for the treatment of wAMD. These companies include Alcon, Allergan, Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC, Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Bayer, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Iconic Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis, Ocular Therapeutix, Inc., Ohr Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ophthotech Corporation, Opthea Limited, PanOptica Pharma, Quark Pharmaceuticals, SciFluor Life Science, LLC, Regeneron and REGENXBIO.
 For the treatment of A1AT deficiency and HAE, we know of a number of products currently in development that aim to reduce the frequency of administration, improve the route of administration, and deliver better efficacy compared to the standard-of-care treatments available today. There are several companies with marketed products or products in clinical development for A1AT deficient patients with emphysema including Kamada Ltd., Shire and Grifols Therapeutics. For the treatment of HAE, there are several companies with marketed products or products in clinical development, including CSL Behring, Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, and Shire.
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments.
 11


Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our therapeutic products, if approved, will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
 Research and Development Expense
 Our research and development expenses were $39.8 million, $31.7 million and $25.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 License and Collaboration Agreements 
 Regeneron 
 In May 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Regeneron for an initial period of three years to research, develop and commercialize novel gene therapy products for the treatment of ophthalmologic diseases. These products are based on our proprietary viral vectors that express transgenes encoding molecules that modulate up to a total of eight specified targets, and encoding certain endogenous molecules known to bind to and modulate such targets (such products, including AVA-311, collectively the “Products”). In February 2017, Regeneron exercised its option to extend the research term of the collaboration agreement for an additional three years, through May 1, 2020.
 Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, we and Regeneron have been conducting a research program to identify potential Products for a specified time period. Regeneron bears all costs of performing research under the Collaboration Agreement. Regeneron has a right to substitute a certain number of such targets and may, subject to a payment to us, expand the collaboration beyond the four initially designated targets to include up to four additional targets not currently being researched or developed by Adverum, and endogenous molecules known to bind to and modulate such additional targets, in the research program.
 Regeneron has an option, exercisable with respect to all Products containing transgenes expressing molecules that modulate one of the specified targets, to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop and commercialize such Products for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of human disease or other medical disorders. Regeneron may exercise this option prior to the expiration of the term of the research program, within a certain time period after the acceptance for filing with the FDA of the IND for such Products. Regeneron must pay us an option fee each time it exercises an option.
 Regeneron has the right to submit an IND with the FDA for Products prior to exercising its option. If Regeneron exercises its option for specified Products, Regeneron will be primarily responsible for developing, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for, and commercializing such Products.
 We have a right to co-fund costs of developing, manufacturing and commercializing Products containing transgenes encoding molecules capable of modulating a target with respect to which Regeneron has exercised its option, subject to certain exceptions. We may exercise this co-funding right up to two times. If we exercise such right, we may elect to bear up to 35% of all development costs incurred for such Products. For any co-funded Products, Regeneron’s payment obligations extend until the Products are no longer sold in the applicable territory. For those Products for which we exercise this option, either party may opt out of sharing development costs for all Products containing transgenes encoding molecules capable of modulating a protein target, in which case the other party may continue to develop and commercialize such Products, subject to the payment of a royalty to the other party ranging from low-single digit to low double-digit royalties. While Regeneron will record all revenue from sales of the co-funded Products, Regeneron will share in the net profits and losses of sales of any Products for which we exercised our co-funding right, with each party receiving a share of profits and bearing its share of losses in accordance with the share of development costs borne by each party for such Product, provided that neither party exercises its opt-out right for such Products.
 12


Under the Collaboration Agreement, Regeneron made an initial payment of $8.0 million dollars for collaboration research costs, a one-time option fee and a one-time license grant fee.
 In addition to the initial payment, Regeneron may make the following payments to us:
  
• | Reimbursement for additional collaboration research costs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Up to $80.0 million in development and regulatory milestones for product candidates directed toward each of the eight therapeutic candidates, for a combined total of up to $640.0 million in potential milestone payments for product candidates directed toward all eight therapeutic targets subject to the Collaboration Agreement; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tiered, low- to mid-single digit royalties on annual net sales, subject to certain adjustments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For each Product, Regeneron’s payment obligations extend until the last to occur of the following: (i) the discontinuation of development of the Product or (ii) once a Product is approved by the FDA, the later of (x) the duration of patent coverage for the Product or (y) ten years after first commercial sale of the Product in a particular territory.
 The collaboration agreement will expire with respect to each collaboration target upon expiration of all payment obligations by Regeneron. The collaboration agreement may also be terminated (i) by Regeneron at will, either in its entirety or on a target by target basis, upon 30 days’ prior written notice to us, (ii) by either party, upon written notice in connection with a material breach remaining uncured 60 days after initial written notice, (iii) by us, if Regeneron challenges the patent rights licensed by us under the collaboration agreement or (iv) by either party, for insolvency of the other party. 
Under our research, collaboration and license agreement with Regeneron, we are required to have a mutually agreed-on research plan with Regeneron in order to invoice Regeneron for services performed. We do not currently have a research plan in place, and, consequently, we are not currently receiving any reimbursements from Regeneron.
 Editas 
 In August 2016, we entered into a collaboration, option, and license agreement with Editas pursuant to which we and Editas collaborate on certain studies using AAV vectors in connection with Editas’ genome editing technology and we grant to Editas an exclusive option to obtain certain exclusive rights to use our proprietary vectors in up to five ophthalmic indications. We received a $1.0 million non-refundable upfront payment, with $0.5 million of such payment to be credited against Editas’ obligation to fund research and development costs during the year ended December 31, 2016. Under the terms of the agreement, both we and Editas are subject to exclusivity obligations. In January 2018, we and Editas extended the collaboration, option and license agreement. In consideration of extending the agreement, Editas made a one-time payment of $0.5 million to us in February 2018. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, Editas may exercise the option with respect to a designated initial indication until September 30, 2018. With respect to the four other indications, Editas may exercise the option until the fourth anniversary of the effective date, provided that the option will expire on the third anniversary of the effective date if Editas has not exercised the option with respect to the initial indication or any other indication by such date. Upon Editas’ timely exercise of the option with respect to the designated initial indication, Editas will pay us a $1.3 million fee. For the first additional indication for which Editas timely exercises its option, Editas will pay us a $1.5 million fee. Upon each subsequent exercise of the option, Editas will pay us a $1.0 million fee per indication. If Editas elects to develop a product using certain of our proprietary vectors, we will be eligible to receive up to $15.5 million in development and commercialization milestone payments for such product, and tiered royalties between the mid-single digits and low teens on net sales of such product, subject to certain adjustments.
 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will be in effect until the later of the expiration of the option exercise period or the expiration of the royalty term of the last product. At any time after the option is first exercised, Editas may terminate the Agreement for convenience in its entirety or on an indication-by-indication or country-by-country basis, upon prior written notice to us. We may also terminate the agreement if Editas challenges our patents relating to its proprietary vectors and does not withdraw such challenge within a defined period of time. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement with written notice upon a bankruptcy of the other party or upon an uncured material breach by the other party.
 University of California 
 In May 2010, we entered into a license agreement with the Regents of University of California (“Regents”), as amended in September 2013. Under the license agreement, the Regents have granted to us an exclusive, even as to the Regents, license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under the Regents’ undivided interest in patent rights covering a method of using recombinant gene delivery vectors for treating or preventing diseases of the eye, to develop and commercialize products covered by such patent rights in all fields of use in the U.S. The licensed patent rights are jointly owned by the Regents and Chiron Corporation, which was acquired by Novartis AG (“Chiron”), but our license extends only to the Regents’ interest in such patent rights.
 13


Under the license agreement, we are obligated to make milestone payments totaling up to $0.9 million upon reaching certain stages of development of the licensed products for one indication and totaling up to $0.5 million for each subsequent indication for which licensed products are developed, for up to a maximum of two additional indications. Through December 31, 2017, none of these goals had been achieved, and no milestones were payable. The license agreement also contains certain royalty payment requirements for net sales of licensed products.
 Our license agreement with the Regents continues in effect for the life of the last-to-expire patent. We expect the agreement to terminate prior to any commercialization of any product candidates to which they apply. We may terminate this agreement without cause at any time upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the Regents. The Regents may terminate this agreement for a breach by us that remains uncured for 60 days, if we become insolvent, if we directly or through a third-party file a claim that a licensed patent right is invalid or unenforceable or if we fail to meet or extend the date for meeting certain diligence milestones.
 Cornell University
 
We were a party to a master service agreement (“MSA”) with Cornell University (“Cornell”) originally established in August 2014 and amended in December 2015. Under the MSA, Cornell provided assistance in regulatory affairs, overall project management, and parameter development. The MSA, as amended, provided for Annapurna to pay Cornell $13.3 million ratably over 4 years for these services as services were performed.
 
In December 2016, we informed Cornell that we decided to terminate the MSA for material breach, effective January 6, 2017. Subsequently, Cornell informed us that it disputes the validity of our termination of the MSA. Although we intend to defend the validity of our termination of the MSA, we recorded $2.0 million of estimated costs associated with the termination of the MSA during the year ended December 31, 2017. This MSA included services relating to our gene therapy programs ADVM-043, ADVM-053 and severe allergy. Our three licensing agreements with Cornell for these programs remain unchanged.
 
The decision to terminate the MSA was due to Cornell’s failure to deliver therapeutic material of ADVM-043 suitable for use in human patients. As a result of this decision, we contracted with a large-scale contract manufacturing organization that complies with cGMP industry standards and can produce product quantities for both our planned clinical trials and potential commercial supply. This was part of our planned upgrade of the manufacturing process for ADVM-043, implementing our proprietary, highly-scalable baculovirus-based production system, in advance of our initiation of the ADVANCE trial in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
In December 2015, Annapurna entered into three licensing agreements with Cornell, pursuant to which we are advancing gene therapy programs ADVM-043, ADVM-053, and severe allergy, which originally were initiated at the Department of Genetic Medicine at Weill Cornell. 
 A1AT Deficiency License Agreement: Under this agreement, we hold an exclusive license to certain know-how related to A1AT deficiency and rights to an IND application to initiate clinical studies of gene therapy for A1AT.
 HAE License Agreement: Under this agreement, we hold an exclusive license to certain technology related to HAE and a non-exclusive license to certain other intellectual property related to the HAE program.
 Allergy License Agreement: Under this agreement, we hold an exclusive license to certain patents related to allergens and a non-exclusive license to certain other technology related to allergens. 
 Across these three license agreements, Cornell is entitled to receive aggregate annual maintenance fees ranging from $30,000 to $0.3 million per year, up to $16.0 million in aggregate milestone payments and royalties on sales in the low single-digits, subject to adjustments and minimum thresholds.
 We may terminate any of these license agreements for convenience upon ninety days written notice. Cornell may terminate any of the license agreements for material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days. Cornell may also terminate the HAE License Agreement and/or the Allergy License Agreement if we commence any action and file a written claim asserting that any portion of the licensed patent rights is invalid or unenforceable.
 Dr. Crystal, Chairman of Genetic Medicine, the Bruce Webster Professor of Internal Medicine and a Professor of Genetic Medicine and of Medicine at Weill Cornell, served as a consultant to Annapurna since inception and continues to provide services to us for an annual base compensation of $0.2 million. 
 
REGENXBIO
 
A1AT Deficiency/Allergy License Agreement: In October 2015, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license with REGENXBIO to certain intellectual property in order to develop and commercialize products for the treatment of A1AT deficiency. Under this agreement, we also had an option to be granted an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property to develop and 
 14


commercialize products for the treatment of severe allergies, however this option was not exercised, and expired in October 2016. Under this license agreement, REGENXBIO was eligible to receive annual maintenance fees, up to approximately $20.0 million in combined milestone payments and royalties in the mid-to-high single digits.  In April 2017, we notified REGENXBIO that we exercised our right to terminate this license agreement for any reason upon six months’ written notice.  The termination was effective in October 2017.
 FA License Agreement: In April 2014, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property in order to develop and commercialize products using the AAVrh.10 vector for FA, where the vector is administered by any route except directly to the central nervous system (“FA Systemic”).
 Under the terms of this license agreement, we also had options to obtain a non-exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize an FA product where the vector is administered directly to the central nervous system (“FA CNS”), as well as an FA Systemic product using another AAV vector. The option to obtain a non-exclusive license to FA Systemic expired in April 2015 and the option to obtain a non-exclusive license for FA CNS expired in April 2016, and neither were exercised. In October 2017, we notified REGENXBIO that we exercised our right to terminate this license agreement for any reason upon six months’ written notice.  The termination will be effective in April 2018.
 Inserm Transfert
 
In July 2014, we entered into an agreement with Inserm Transfert (“Inserm”) whereby we hold an exclusive license to certain patents to develop and commercialize products for the treatment of FA and a non-exclusive license to certain other intellectual property related to the FA program. The agreement was amended in October 2015 to increase the scope of the intellectual property under the licenses. Under this agreement, Inserm is entitled to receive certain de minimis license payments, certain development milestone payments of up to approximately €2.0 million in the aggregate and royalties on sales in the low single-digits, subject to adjustments.
 Unless earlier terminated, this agreement will be in effect on a country-by-country, licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the later of the expiration of the last claim of the licensed intellectual property which cover the manufacture, use or sale of such product in such country or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country in which such product is sold. Upon a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, Annapurna will have a fully paid up, perpetual, irrevocable license with respect to such product in such country under the licensed intellectual property following expiration of this agreement with respect to such product in the applicable country. Annapurna may terminate this agreement upon 60 days’ prior written notice. Inserm may terminate this license agreement if Annapurna becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy or fails to meet development milestones and such failure is not cured within a specified number of days. Inserm may also terminate the license granted to Annapurna in a given country if Annapurna (i) before regulatory approval of a product in any country, has ceased conducting any development of products in all countries for 12 consecutive months or (ii) after regulatory approval of a product in a given country, has ceased marketing such product in such country for 12 consecutive months.
 Pursuant to Section 4.7 of the agreement with Inserm, our acquisition of Annapurna triggered a one-time payment to Inserm of €0.3 million.
 Intellectual Property 
 Overview
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions where available.
 15


Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; obtain regulatory exclusivity and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
 We own or license more than 60 patent applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. More than 50 patent applications have been filed in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions by or on behalf of universities which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, more than 20 patents have been issued to us or to our licensors that are active. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek patent protection in the U.S. and abroad for a variety of technologies, including: research tools and methods, AAV-based biological products, methods for treating diseases of interest and methods for manufacturing our AAV-based products. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel biological products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various other license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development.
 Company-owned Intellectual Property 
 We own three families of patent applications that are directed to AAV-based compositions and methods for treating or preventing eye diseases associated with neovascularization. Applications in the first of these families relate to an AAV gene therapy for the treatment of wAMD using an anti-VEGF composition, various unit dosages, dosing regimens and routes of administration. Applications in this family are pending in the U.S., and corresponding patent applications are pending elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Asia. Patents that may eventually issue from this patent family, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2033, subject to possible patent term extensions.  Applications in the second and third of these families relate to AAV gene therapy for the treatment of wAMD using the 7m8 vector to deliver ranibizumab or aflibercept.  Each family has an application pending in the U.S. and a corresponding pending PCT application.  Patents that may eventually issue from either of these patent families, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2037, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 We also own seven families of patent applications that are directed to various aspects of our proprietary technology platform.  These families contain pending U.S. provisional or PCT applications or national phase applications in the U.S., elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Asia. Patents that may eventually issue from these families, if any, are generally expected to expire between 2036 and 2038, subject to possible patent term extensions. 
 We are also pursuing innovative ways to regulate the expression of transgenes in tissues. To that end, we have, in collaboration with Stanford University, filed a U.S. patent application that is directed to methods for regulating gene expression in a subject. Patents that grant from this application, if any, are expected to expire in 2033, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 Licensed Intellectual Property
 We have obtained both exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to patents directed to both compositions of matter and methods of use and to other intellectual property.
 For example, we have exclusively licensed several families of patents and patent applications that relate to variant rAAV virions having desirable characteristics, such as increased infectivity, as well as novel methods to screen for such variants.
 One patent family that we have exclusively licensed includes granted patents in the U.S., as well as elsewhere in North America and Europe, as well as a pending patent application in Canada. The patents in this family are projected to expire in 2024, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 Another patent family that we have exclusively licensed includes granted U.S. patents that are projected to expire in 2031 and a pending U.S. patent application that, if granted, is also projected to expire in 2031, in both cases subject to possible patent term extensions.
 16


A third patent family that we have exclusively licensed includes claims directed to the novel AAV7m8 vector, which allows delivery of transgenes to the retina via intravitreal injection, and which we utilize in clinical candidates ADVM-022 and ADVM-032.  This family includes issued patents in the U.S., as well as elsewhere in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific.  Corresponding applications are pending in the U.S. and elsewhere in North America, Asia and the Pacific. Patents that issue from this patent family, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2032, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 We have also nonexclusively licensed rights to a patent family that includes issued patents in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. These patents are expected to expire in 2027, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 We have exclusively licensed a family of patent applications related to gene therapy treatments for HAE, C1-esterase deficiency, which includes pending U.S. and foreign applications. Patents that grant from this patent family, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2036, subject to possible patent term extensions and adjustments. 
 We have exclusively licensed a family of patent applications related to gene therapy treatments for severe allergies, which includes pending U.S. and foreign applications. Patents that grant from this patent family, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2036, subject to patent term extensions and adjustments. 
 We have exclusively licensed a family of patents and applications related to the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with FA. This family includes a granted US patent and pending applications in the U.S. and elsewhere in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific. Patents that grant from this patent family, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2033, subject to possible patent term extensions and adjustments.
 We have also exclusively licensed a patent family directed to the use of certain rAAVs for use in FA Systemic including pending applications in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hungary, Israel, Japan, New Zealand and the U.S. patents that grant from this patent family, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2022, subject to possible patent term extensions and adjustments. 
 We have exclusively licensed certain know-how related to gene therapy for A1AT deficiency and rights to an IND to initiate clinical studies of gene therapy for A1AT.
 Trade Secret Protection
 Finally, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology, including with regard to technology or other aspects of our product candidates for which we do not obtain patent protection. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of drug product and biologic product candidates. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and export and import of our product candidates.
 17


In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), and the FDA implements regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, the approval process, or post-approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) and approval by the FDA before being marketed in the U.S. Similarly, FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the U.S. 
 Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies and FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER in its review. Gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) are also subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities’ Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (“RAC”), which will soon only publicly review clinical trials if the trials cannot be evaluated by standard oversight bodies and pose unusual risks. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC public review process can delay the initiation of a clinical trial.  Similarly, the FDA can put an IND on clinical hold even if the RAC provides an exemption from an in-depth, public review. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products IND applications; FDA guidance documents provide the current thinking about a particular subject, yet are not legally binding. However, products in this area are novel and present highly complex scientific and medical issues, making the predictability of FDA’s policies and practices in this area less certain.
 The process required by the FDA before our product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves:
  
• | Completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, preclinical studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with current Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission of an IND to the FDA, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Before testing any drug product or biologic product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. 
 18


Our gene therapy studies involve recombinant DNA research, and therefore compliance with NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (“NIH Guidelines”) is mandatory.  Appropriate protocol(s) and related documentations are submitted to, and the study is registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (“OBA”), pursuant to the NIH Guidelines. The NIH is responsible for convening the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (“RAC”) that will discuss the protocol(s) including issues that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC's decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and can be accessed by the public.
 The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical trial protocol, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The OBA notifies the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the content(s) of the IND that could potentially expose human research subjects to health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the IND goes into effect and the clinical trial can begin.  With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold on an IND, clinical trials may not commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by FDA.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur, and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IRB for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. Clinical testing also must satisfy GCP requirements, including the requirements for informed consent from all subjects. FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe all surviving subjects who receive treatment using gene therapies in clinical trials for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a minimum 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. FDA does not require the long-term tracking to be complete prior to its review of the BLA. 
 All clinical research performed in the United States in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, under FDA regulations at 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an application for marketing approval if (i) the study was conducted in accordance with GCP as further detailed in the regulation, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, and (ii) if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.  In addition, FDA requires that a sponsor or applicant who submits data from a foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND as support for a marketing application submit, in addition to other required information, a description of the actions the sponsor or applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP.  Further, when a sponsor intends for marketing approval of a new drug to be based solely on foreign clinical data, additional requirements apply that are described in FDA regulations. 
 Clinical Trials
 For purposes of BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1: Clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: Clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored studies that are generally conducted in a limited subject population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications in subjects with the disease or condition under study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19


 
• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a product candidate. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of subjects, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse subject population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after the product’s approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the product. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials or post-marketing or post approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials.
 Per the regulations, a sponsor (in industry or academia) of a clinical trial must register a clinical trial on the ClinicalTrials.gov website, the registry of new and on-going clinical trials of drugs, biologics, and device products. Sponsors are required to maintain the currency of the posting of the clinical trials posted on-line in the registry. This clinical trial registry and results data bank for clinical trials also contains summary results information on a clinical trial including adverse event information from the clinical trials and for pediatric post-market surveillance of a device product. The registry also provides information that helps patients find trials for which they might be eligible, enhance the design of clinical trials and prevent duplication of unsuccessful or unsafe trials, improve the evidence base that informs clinical care, increase the efficiency of drug and device development processes, improve clinical research practice, and build public trust in clinical research. These phases of testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

Biologics License Applications 
 The results of preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee unless a waiver applies, and is subject to a sixty day filing review period to determine if the application is substantially complete to permit substantive review. Given our current company size and likely growth over the next years prior to a BLA submission, we would likely submit for a waiver to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) fees based on our company size and it being our first BLA.
 Under the PDUFA, the FDA has a performance goal to review applications within 6 months for priority reviews or 10 months for standard reviews. The review timeline begins upon FDA’s acceptance of the original application submission for filing, no later than 60 calendar days from the date FDA receives the application. In some instances, the review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended depending on the information required in order the FDA reviewers to complete their review of the BLA.
 The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, which may require additional clinical data or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Moreover, even if a product receives approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited or subject to Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Once the FDA approves a BLA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such product or require a recall of any biologic or drug already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved biologics which have been commercialized. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a biologic or drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
 Biologics may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished biologic or drug product, and sometimes, for drug products, the active drug ingredient, is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance and will not approve the product unless compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements is satisfactory.
 The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our product candidates for the treatment of a disease, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing drugs. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the biologic. After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to a BLA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 In addition, prior to submitting a BLA for a new biologic, a sponsor may be able to take advantage of one or more FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition (e.g., priority review, fast track designation) provided the product meets the criteria for those programs.  While some of these programs have been in existence for a number of years, Congress established additional programs intended to expedite the development of drugs and biologics in the recently enacted 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), which was signed into law on December 13, 2016.  Notably with respect to gene therapy products, section 3012 of the Cures Act clarifies the authority of FDA to facilitate the development, review, and approval of “genetically targeted drugs” and “variant protein targeted drugs” to address an unmet medical need in one or more patient subgroups, including subgroups of patients with different mutations of a gene, with respect to rare diseases or conditions that are serious or life-threatening.  21st Century Cures Act Section 3033 also 
 21


established a regenerative advanced therapy designation process intended to expedite the development of regenerative medicine therapies, defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and part 1271 of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, that are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. 
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Biologic and drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA for that biologic.
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics and drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.  Under FDA’s current interpretation of the relevant laws, in proactively promoting a drug, a company generally can make only those substantiated claims relating to safety and efficacy that are for indications approved by the FDA and that are otherwise consistent with the FDA-approved label for the drug or biologic. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act and civil monetary penalty law, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


 
• | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs and protects the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information of certain health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers, and their respective business associates that perform services for them involving individually identifiable health information; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 In addition, recent events in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry generally have resulted in increased public and governmental scrutiny of the cost of drugs. In particular, U.S. federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies seeking information about drug pricing practices and the U.S. Senate is investigating several pharmaceutical companies relating to drug price increases and pricing practices. If we obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected if these inquiries were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products.
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. A number of gene therapy products have been approved over the past year by the FDA. Although the CMS subsequently approved its first method of coverage and reimbursement for one such product, the methodology has been subject to challenge by members of Congress. CMS’s decision as to coverage and reimbursement for one product does not mean that all similar products will be eligible for analogous coverage and reimbursement. As there is no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement amongst third-party payors in the United States, even if CMS approves coverage and reimbursement for any of our product candidates, it is unclear what affect, if any, such a decision will have on our ability to obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement from other private payors.
 Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payers do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are 
 23


inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.  In addition, following the November 2016 Presidential election in the United States, significant uncertainty exists regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act.  It is possible that there will be legislation in the future either to amend or replace the Affordable Care Act and that such new legislation will be generally unfavorable toward the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries (including with regard to a possible reduction in the number of insured individuals with access to drug coverage or additional measures aimed at high cost drug and biologic products).  At this time, it is unclear whether those changes will also have an impact on biologic product exclusivity or the biosimilar product licensure pathway established under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on cost containment measures in the U.S. and other countries has increased, and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we or our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we or our collaborators must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marking authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure includes selecting one reference member state (RMS), and submitting to more than one EU member state at the same time. The RMS National Competent Authority conducts a detailed review and prepares an assessment report, to which concerned member states provide comment. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marking authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states post-initial approval. Under the centralized procedure, within 120 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
 In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we or our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future drugs.
 Environmental Regulation
 We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and end-of-life handling or disposition of products, and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Although the costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including requirements in the European Union relating to the restriction of use of hazardous substances in products, have not been material, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits.
Segment and Geographic Information
 We operate and manage our business as one reporting and operating segment, which is the business of developing and commercializing gene therapeutics. Our chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and our revenues are generated in the U.S. Substantially all of our non-monetary long-lived assets are located in the U.S.
