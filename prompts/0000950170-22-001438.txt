BUSINESS OUTLOOK
 Our net sales increased approximately $575.9 million, or 46.9%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, due primarily to our content expansion initiatives, improvements in product mix, overall strong demand for our products (especially in comparison to the negative effect of Covid-19 in 2020), and record revenue in the automotive, industrial, communication and consumer end-user markets. The 46.9% increase in net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was driven, by a 25.5% organic growth attributable to the Company’s legacy business that existed prior to the Lite-On Semiconductor (“LSC”) acquisition and 21.4% is related to the positive net sales increase from the acquisition of LSC. Contributing to the Company's growth in net sales has been the success of our focused expansion initiative in the automotive market where revenue grew over 59% when compared to year 2020, generating an 8-year CAGR of 30%. Additionally, our Pericom product line continued to set new revenue records, achieving 5 consecutive quarters of growth. The Company has experienced growth in higher-margin end markets which, when combined with increased manufacturing loading at LSC facilities, has enabled the Company to increase its net sales and margins, even in the midst of the current supply-constrained environment. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, weighted-average sales

price of the Company's products increased 9.5% when compared to the same period last year. This represents the improved product mix across the portfolio, as well as price increases to offset supply chain cost increasing.
We continue to work towards our previously stated goals for 2025 of $1.0 billion in gross profit based upon $2.5 billion in revenue and a gross margin of 40%. At a high level, tactics we intend to use to accomplish these goals include:
 •Total systems solutions sales approach and content expansion driving growth:
 •Increased focus on high-margin automotive, industrial, and Pericom product lines; and
 •Investment in technology leadership in target products, fab processes, and advanced packaging.
  Acquisitions also remain a part of our growth strategy to reach our revenue goal. In November 2020 we acquired LSC and its subsidiaries. The acquisition of LSC broadened our discrete product offerings, including providing us with a leadership position in glass-passivated bridges and rectifiers that allows us to further extend our position in the automotive and industrial markets consistent with our overall growth strategy. Further, the acquisition expands our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity. We believe we have the opportunity to improve LSC’s profitability through operating and manufacturing improvements as well as increased factory utilization. 
We have a solid pipeline of designs and expanded customer relationships across all regions and product lines. The success of our business depends on, among other factors, the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, our customers’ demand for our products, the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations, the likelihood of customers not canceling or deferring existing orders, and the strength of consumers’ demand for items containing our products in the end-markets we serve. We believe the long-term outlook for our business remains generally favorable, despite the uncertainties in the global economy, as we continue to execute on the strategy that has proven successful for us over the years. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Business Outlook” in Part II, Item 7 and “Risk Factors – The success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our net sales, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.

We sell product primarily through our operations in Asia, the Americas, and Europe. See Note 16 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Annual Report for additional information.
OUR INDUSTRY
 Semiconductors are critical components used to manufacture a broad range of electronic products and systems. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, continuous improvements in semiconductor processes and design technologies have led to smaller, more complex, and more reliable devices at a lower cost per function. The availability of low-cost semiconductors, together with increased consumer demand for sophisticated electronic systems, has led to the proliferation of semiconductors in diverse end-use applications.
OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
We believe our competitive strengths include the following:
Flexible, scalable and cost-effective manufacturing – Our manufacturing operations are a core element of our success, and we have designed our manufacturing base to allow us to respond quickly to changes in demand trends in the end-markets we serve. For example, we have structured our assembly and test facilities to enable us to rapidly and efficiently add capacity and adjust product mix to meet shifts in customer demand and overall market trends. Our manufacturing facilities provide us with access to a workforce at a relatively low overall cost base while enabling us to better serve our leading customers, many of which are located in Asia. See “Risk Factors – During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower net sales and lower profit margins may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.
Integrated packaging expertise – Our expertise in designing and manufacturing innovative and proprietary packaging solutions enables us to package a variety of different device functions into an assortment of packages ranging from miniature chip-scale packaging to packages that integrate multiple separate discrete and/or analog chips into a single semiconductor product called an array. Our ability to design and manufacture multi-chip semiconductor solutions as well as advanced integrated devices provides our customers with products of equivalent functionality with fewer individual parts, and at lower overall cost, than alternative products. This combination of integration, functionality and miniaturization makes our products well suited for the industrial, consumer electronics, communications, computing and automotive markets.
Broad customer base and diverse end-markets – Our customers are comprised of leading direct sales customers as well as major electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”) providers. We serve over 50,000 customers worldwide. Although some of these

customers are direct, the majority of our customers are served through our more than 50 distributors.  Our products are ultimately used in end-products in a number of markets served by our broad customer base, which we believe makes us less susceptible to market fluctuations driven by either specific customers or specific end-user applications.
Customer-focused product development – Effective collaboration with our customers and a commitment to customer service are essential elements of our business. We believe focusing on dependable delivery and support tailored to specific end-user applications and solution-selling approach has fostered deep customer relationships and created a key competitive advantage for us in the highly fragmented discrete, logic and analog and mixed-signal semiconductor marketplace. We believe our close relationships with our customers have provided us with keener insight into our customers’ product needs. This results in a stronger demand for our product designs and often provides us with insight into additional opportunities for new design wins in our customers’ products.

During 2021 and 2020, we continued to achieve many significant new design wins with our direct sales customers. Although a design win from a customer does not necessarily guarantee future sales to that customer, we believe that continued introduction of new and well-defined product solutions is critically important in maintaining and extending our market share in the highly competitive semiconductor marketplace. See “Risk Factors – Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.
Expand our available market opportunities – We believe we have many paths to increasing our addressable market opportunities. From a product perspective, we intend to continue expanding our product portfolio by developing derivative and enhanced performance devices that target adjacent markets and end-equipment. We will continue to cultivate new and emerging customers within our targeted markets, further increasing our already broad customer base. As we focus on new customers, we try to expand our product portfolio penetration within these new, as well as existing, customers. As we expand our extensive range of high power efficiency and small form factor packages, we plan to introduce new and existing product functions in these new packages to allow an even greater market coverage.
Maintain intense customer focus – We intend to continue to strengthen and deepen our customer relationships. We believe that continued focus on customer service is important and will help to increase our net sales, operating performance and market share. To accomplish this, we intend to continue to closely collaborate with our customers to design products that meet their specific needs. A critical element of this strategy is to further reduce our design cycle time in order to quickly provide our customers with innovative products. Additionally, to support our customer-focused strategy, we continue to expand our sales force and field application engineers, particularly in Asia and Europe, during periods of growth. See “Risk Factors – We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.
Enhance cost competitiveness – A key element of our success is our overall low-cost manufacturing base. While we believe our manufacturing facilities are among the most efficient in the industry, we will continue to refine our proprietary manufacturing processes and technology to achieve additional cost efficiencies. We have continued to make capital expenditures to enhance our existing manufacturing capabilities.
Pursue selective strategic acquisitions – As part of our strategy to expand our semiconductor product offerings and to maximize our market opportunities, we may acquire technologies, product lines or companies in order to enhance our product portfolio and accelerate our new product offerings. Since 2006 we have acquired a number of companies that enhanced our product portfolio, including Pericom Semiconductor Corporation (“Pericom”) in 2015. In 2019, we acquired from Texas Instruments a 200mm wafer fabrication

facility and operations located in Greenock, Scotland (“GFAB”). The acquisition of GFAB adds to our existing global footprint, but also provides expanded wafer capacity to support our product growth, in particular for the automotive market. In November 2020 we acquired LSC and its subsidiaries. The acquisition of LSC broadened our discrete product offerings, including providing us with a leadership position in glass-passivated bridges and rectifiers that will allow us to extend our position in the automotive and industrial market spaces consistent with our overall growth strategy. Further, the acquisition expanded our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity. We believe we have an opportunity to improve LSC’s profitability through operating and manufacturing improvements as well as increased factory utilization.
See “Risk Factors – Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition” in Part I, Item 1A and Note 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Annual Report for additional information.

MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND FACILITIES
We operate nine assembly and test facilities; seven located in China, one located in Taiwan and one located in Germany. We operate eight wafer fabrication facilities; four located in China, two located in Taiwan and two located in Great Britain.
In 2010, we entered into an agreement with the Management Committee of the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone (the “CDHT”). In connection with the agreement with CDHT, we formed a joint venture entity with a Chinese company, Chengdu Ya Guang Electronic Company Limited (“Ya Guang”), to establish a semiconductor assembly and test manufacturing facility in Chengdu, China. We currently own approximately 98% of the equity of the joint venture entity. The CDHT granted the joint venture entity a 50-year land lease, provides corporate and employee tax incentives, tax refunds, subsidies and other financial support. We believe this arrangement will be a long-term, multi-year project that will provide us additional capacity as needed. As of December 31, 2021, we have invested in this joint venture approximately $222.9 million, primarily for infrastructure, buildings and equipment-related capital expenditures. For the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, our total cash capital expenditures were approximately $141.2 million and $75.8 million, respectively.
Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, aluminum and copper lead frames, gold and copper wire and other metals, molding compounds and various chemicals and gases. We also rely on equipment and finished product suppliers. We are continuously evaluating our raw material costs in order to reduce our consumption while protecting and maintaining product performance. We have no material agreements with any of our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. See “Risk Factors – We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.
Our corporate headquarters is located in a facility we own in Plano, Texas. We also lease or own properties around the world for use as sales and administrative offices, research and development centers, manufacturing facilities, warehouses and logistics centers. The size or location of these properties can change from time to time based on our business requirements. See “Properties” in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report for additional information.
BACKLOG
The amount of backlog to be shipped during any period is dependent upon various factors, and orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty to the customer. Orders are generally booked from one month to greater than twelve months in advance of delivery. The rate of booking of new orders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and the industry as a whole, continue to experience a trend towards shorter customer-requested lead-times, and we expect this trend to continue. The amount of backlog at any date depends upon various factors, including the timing of the receipt of orders, fluctuations in orders of existing product lines, and the introduction of new product lines. Accordingly, we believe that the amount of our backlog at any date is not an accurate measure of our future sales. We strive to maintain proper inventory levels to support our customers’ just-in-time order expectations. Our backlog of orders, based on expected ship date, was $793.1 million at December 31, 2021 and $618.3 million at December 31, 2020.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND LICENSES
 We generally rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements, license agreements and policies to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology, and to maintain our competitive position.

Despite these measures, we may not always succeed in protecting our intellectual property or preventing misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. Other companies may independently develop similar technologies or seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property rights. We acquired or licensed or sublicensed numerous intellectual property rights in connection with our acquisitions over the years. We have registered several of our trademarks in the U.S. and other countries, and seek to strengthen our brand to distinguish our products in the marketplace. We maintain a patent portfolio comprised of both U.S. and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the U.S. and other countries. We expect to continue to file patent applications in the U.S. and abroad covering technologies and products considered to be important to our business. We do not believe any individual patent, group of patents, or the expiration thereof would materially affect the operation of our business. For proprietary technology or related know-how that is not covered by our patent strategy, we seek to protect them as trade secrets through contracts and policies to maintain their secrecy and confidentiality.
In the ordinary course of business, we may become party to disputes involving intellectual property rights. When we become aware of companies infringing our intellectual property rights, we seek to enforce our rights through appropriate actions. We may receive claims of infringement or inquiries regarding possible infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, demands seeking royalty payments or other remedies, or cease and desist letters. Depending on the situations, we may defend our position, seek to negotiate a license or engage in other acceptable resolution that is appropriate to our business.
We provide limited intellectual property indemnification for certain customers and may experience financial exposure related to intellectual property indemnity claims. In certain situations, there are limits on our potential indemnification liability; however, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of potential payments, if any. Although to date we have not paid any significant amounts for intellectual property indemnity claims, there can be no assurance that we will not face significant exposure in the future.
 From time to time, we may license our intellectual property rights in connection with the development or sale of our products. We may license certain product technology from other companies, but we do not consider any particular licensed technology to be material to our operations or royalties paid by us to be material. We believe the duration and other terms of the licenses are appropriate for our current needs. See “Risk Factors – We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense, reduction in our intellectual property rights and a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.
Our foreign operations expose us to unique intellectual property technology risks compared to a company with fewer or no international operations. For example, we are exposed to potential cyber security breaches that may target our employees or infrastructure outside the United States. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our International Operations” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a more detailed summary of the intellectual property technology risks associated with our international business operations.
 This Annual Report may include trade names and trademarks of other companies. Our use or display of other parties’ trade names, trademarks or products is not intended to, and does not imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, the trade names or trademark owners. All trademarks appearing in this Annual Report not owned by us are the property of their holders.

Our engineering and research and development groups consist of applications, circuit design, and product development engineers who assist in determining the direction of our future product lines. One of their key functions is to work closely with market-leading customers to further refine, expand and improve our product portfolio within our target product types and packages. In addition, customer requirements and acceptance of new package types are assessed, and we seek to develop new, higher-density and more energy-efficient packages to satisfy customers’ needs.

Product development engineers work directly with our semiconductor circuit design and layout engineers to develop and design products that match our customers’ requirements. We seek to capture the customers’ electrical and packaging requirements and translate those requirements into product specifications which can then be designed and manufactured to support customers’ end-system applications.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
 As an international semiconductor company with a global footprint, the Company recognizes the important role its human capital plays in a talent-based economy, and what the impact of effective and efficient human capital management has on its long-term strategic success and sustainable growth. Our employees are our most critical asset—they contribute to our financial success for the benefit of all our stakeholders and they are collaborators and contributors to the success of the communities in which we live and work. Human capital management affects many aspects of our operations, including recruitment and talent acquisition, retention, training, workforce optimization, performance management, workplace safety, employee health and wellness, employee engagement, and diversity and inclusion.
Employee Communication - Developing two–way communications and deploying effective feedback mechanisms are critical components in our employee engagement process. We have an open door policy, and encourage employees to have regular conversations with their managers to share feedback and express concerns. We also solicit employee feedback informally through regular employee interactions. We hold our managers accountable for setting clear expectations and goals with their teams, for providing coaching, as well as identifying professional development opportunities for their teams, and for engaging in periodic performance reviews. We assist our managers with performance management tools as needed to help them effectively manage their teams and optimize workforce productivity.
Employee Retention, Training and Coaching - Employee retention is a critical element in our sustainable success. To maintain a stable workforce, we provide skill advancement training and coaching, where appropriate, to help our employees enhance their existing skillsets. With our support and preparation, our employees can continue to grow in their current role and maximize the value they contribute to their current teams. Where a suitable rotation opportunity arises, we provide skill expansion training to equip employees for these new positions. By honing their skills, our employees can leverage their institutional knowledge and experience to contribute to the overall success of the organization. The availability of rotational opportunities can also help keep our employees motivated and engaged.
Employee Safety - As an employer with a global workforce, we seek to provide safe working conditions and encourage our employees to engage in safe behaviors while completing their assigned job duties. We have programs to enhance the occupational health and safety of our employees and to promote employee wellness. These initiatives are designed to yield positive business outcomes, such as less absenteeism, more motivated and engaged workforce, higher productivity, more consistent quality performance, and a better corporate image in our local communities—which in turn should help us attract talent and maintain a stable workforce.
Employee Demographics - We regularly review our workforce demographics and organizational structure to ensure that we have an efficient organization positioned to deliver cost-effective, high-quality products to our customers and to serve the markets in which we operate. Diversity and inclusion considerations are embodied in many aspects of our operations, including pipeline opportunities.
  As of December 31, 2021, we employed 8,921 employees (including approximately 984 temporary labor or independent contractors). 7,863 of our employees were in Asia, 223 were in the Americas. and 835 were in Europe. None of our employees in Asia or the U.S. are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and in Europe all our employees are covered by individual employment agreements with some collective bargaining agreements in place. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. See “Risk Factors – We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and management/executive personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Any of these regulations could require us to acquire equipment or to incur substantial other costs to comply with environmental regulations or remediate problems. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our capital expenditures for environmental controls have not been material.

Keylink is a 5% joint venture partner in our Shanghai assembly and test facilities. We sell products to, and purchase inventory from, companies owned by Keylink. In addition, our subsidiaries in China lease their manufacturing facilities in Shanghai from, and subcontract a portion of our manufacturing process (metal plating and environmental services) to Keylink. We also pay a consulting fee to Keylink.
