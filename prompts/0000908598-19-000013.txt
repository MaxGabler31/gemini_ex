Products and Strategy

KBS

KBS is a Maine-based manufacturer that started business in 2001 as a manufacturer of modular homes. In 2008, KBS began manufacturing commercial modular multi-family housing units. In subsequent years, KBS expanded its product offerings to include a variety of commercial buildings including apartments, condominiums, townhouses, dormitories, hospitals, office buildings, and other structures. The structures are built inside our climate-controlled factories and transported to the site where they are set, assembled and secured on the foundation. Electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems are inspected and tested in the factory, prior to transportation to the site, to ensure the modules meet all local building codes and quality requirements. Modular construction has gained increased acceptance and is a preferred method of building by many architects and general contractors. The advantages of modular construction include: modules are constructed in a climate-controlled environment; weather conditions usually do not interrupt or delay construction; the building is protected from weather, reducing the risk of mold due to materials absorbing moisture from rain or snow; reduced site work; improved safety and security; reduced vandalism and attrition, as the building is immediately secured; and a significant reduction in overall project time.

The KBS competitive strategy is to offer top quality products for both commercial and residential buildings with a focus on customization to suit the project requirements, provide value with our engineering and design expertise, and meet the timeframe needed by the customer. Our production strategy is to maintain and grow the resources necessary to build a variety of commercial and residential buildings. We attempt to utilize the most efficient methods of manufacturing and high-quality materials in all of our projects. Our sales team works to attract new architects and contractors in New England who need the flexibility that KBS offers.

EBGL

Glenbrook is a retail supplier of lumber, windows, doors, cabinets, drywall, roofing, decking and other building materials and conducts its operations in Oakdale, Minnesota. EdgeBuilder is a manufacturer of structural wall panels, permanent wood foundation systems and other engineered wood products and conducts its operations in Prescott, Wisconsin. Glenbrook and EdgeBuilder are managed by a single management team and operated as a single company. EdgeBuilder manufactures its wall panels and permanent wood foundation systems in a climate-controlled factory and transports them by flat-bed trucks to the customer building location where they are lifted by crane and assembled and erected on site. Panelized construction, especially in large-scale projects, is becoming increasingly popular because wall panels can be constructed ahead of time and stored until needed, they can reduce overall site construction time and the on-site assembly can be performed with smaller crews. Additionally, because the wall panels are constructed in a controlled indoor environment: weather conditions do not usually interrupt or delay construction; the building and materials are not exposed to the weather as they are during a traditional build; there is improved safety and security; and the wall panels are manufactured with higher quality and greater precision than a traditional on-site build.

The Glenbrook competitive strategy is to provide top-quality building materials and unmatched service and attention to detail to building professionals, as well as homeowners. In addition, Glenbrook provides highly personalized service, knowledgeable salespeople and attention to detail that the larger, big-box chain home stores do not provide. The EdgeBuilder competitive strategy is to offer a superior product unique to the project’s requirements, provide value with our engineering and design expertise, and meet the timeframe needed by the customer, while staying cost-competitive. EdgeBuilder’s production strategy is to utilize automation and the most efficient methods of manufacturing and high-quality materials in all of its projects.
Customers

Our customers include residential home builders, general contractors, owners/developers of commercial buildings, and individual retail customers. With regards to KBS, since 2014, we have pursued a strategy of moving away from very large, complex commercial projects to focus on single-family residential homes and smaller commercial projects, which has helped to further diversify our customer base and limit our exposure to any one customer or project. However, we continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial percentage of our net sales. In 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales. 
Competition

KBS is a regional manufacturer of modular housing units. KBS’s market is the New England states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont). Several modular manufacturers are located in these New England states and in nearby Pennsylvania. Some competitors have manufacturing locations in Canada and ship their products to the United States. KBS’s competitors include Maple Leaf Homes (Canada), Pennwest Homes, Champion Home Builders, Muncy Homes, Professional Building Systems, Ritz-Craft Homes, Commodore Corporation and Simplex Homes.

EBGL is a regional manufacturer of engineered structural wall panels and permanent wood foundation systems, and also has a local retail business. EBGL’s market is primarily the Upper Midwest States (Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin). EBGL’s competitors include Precision Company, Component Manufacturing Company, Schweiter Building Supply and Construction Company, Arrow Building Center, and Marshall Truss. EBGL’s retail building supply business competes on a more local level against both small, local lumber yards, regional building supply companies and, to a certain degree, the “big box” stores such as Home Depot and Lowe’s.
Manufacturing and Supplies

KBS’s manufacturing operations are based in Maine. KBS leases two manufacturing plants: a 90,000 square foot facility in South Paris, Maine, and a 60,000 square foot facility in Waterford, Maine. Lumber and supplies for both facilities are purchased from our main location in South Paris. Residential homes and commercial buildings are manufactured in these climate controlled

facilities. We emphasize quality and conformance to all the local building codes where the home or building will be located. Independent building code inspectors are on site almost daily inspecting every stage of the manufacturing process.

EBGL’s manufacturing operations are located in Prescott, Wisconsin. EdgeBuilder leases a 34,000 square foot manufacturing plant where it manufactures wall panels and permanent wood foundation systems. EBGL’s retail operations are located in Oakdale, Minnesota. Glenbrook leases 30,000 square feet of commercial space where it operates its retail building supply business.

Both KBS’s and EBGL’s major material components are dimensional lumber and wood sheet products, which include plywood and oriented strand board. Lumber costs are subject to market fluctuations. Some of our required construction materials are only available through limited local sources in New England, Wisconsin and Minnesota. However, we can source such items from other parts of the country if a local supplier is unable to provide the material. We do not maintain long-term agreements with our suppliers and we purchase all of the materials used in our products through individual purchase orders. We keep a limited inventory of most commonly used materials on hand at our locations.
Sales and Marketing

In fiscal year 2017, sales of residential homes and commercial structures represented approximately 68% and 32%, respectively, of total net sales. In 2017, all sales were shipped within the United States.

KBS markets its modular homes products through direct sales people and through a network of independent dealers, builders, and contractors in New England. KBS’s direct sales organization is responsible for all commercial building projects, and works with developers, architects, owners, and general contractors to establish the scope of work, terms of payment, and general requirements for each project. KBS’s sales people also work with independent dealers, builders, and contractors to accurately configure and place orders for residential homes for their end customers. KBS’s network of independent dealers and contractors do not work with it exclusively, although many have KBS model homes on display at their retail centers. KBS does not assign exclusive territories to its independent dealers and contractors, but they tend to sell in areas of New England where they will not be competing against another KBS dealer or contractor.

EBGL markets its engineered structural wall panels and permanent wood foundation systems through direct sales people and a network of builders, contractors and developers in the Upper Midwest states. EBGL’s direct sales organization is responsible for both residential and commercial projects and it works with general contractors, developers and builders to provide bids and quotes for specific projects.

Our marketing efforts include participation in industry trade shows and production of product literature and sales support tools. These efforts are designed to generate sales leads for our independent builders and dealers, and direct salespeople.
Seasonality

Although modular and wall panel construction in our factories eliminates many of the weather-related challenges encountered with site-built construction, our operations can still be impacted by weather and other seasonal factors. Weather can cause delays in site preparation, including delays in building the foundation for a commercial project or residential home, access to building sites and customer delays in setting wall panels or modular homes due to weather conditions and temperature. Additionally, sales demand, especially for residential homes, generally weakens in the winter months, particularly in the northeast and upper midwest regions of the United States. As a result, both KBS and EBGL experience some seasonality. At KBS, the third quarter typically is the strongest demand period and the first quarter typically is the lowest demand period during the year. Although EBGL experiences some seasonality, it is less pronounced than KBS. EBGL’s fluctuations in business are impacted more by the timing of its large wall panel projects. At EBGL, the first quarter typically is the strongest demand period and the third quarter typically is the lowest demand period during the year.
Environmental

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws, rules and regulations. We are subject to environmental laws, rules and regulations that limit discharges into the environment, establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, substances and wastes, and require cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. These laws, ordinances and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Many of them provide for substantial fines and penalties, orders (including orders to cease operations) and criminal sanctions for violations. They may also impose liability for property damage and personal injury 
5

stemming from the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. In addition, certain of our operations require us to obtain, maintain compliance with, and periodically renew permits.
Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we had 188 employees. Of our 188 employees, 143 serve in manufacturing, 8 in sales, marketing, and customer service, and 37 in general administration and finance. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
