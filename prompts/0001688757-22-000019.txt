ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a medical technology company focused on improving patient safety and aesthetic outcomes, initially in the breast aesthetics and reconstruction market. We initially incorporated in Costa Rica in 2004 and subsequently reorganized under a parent holding company in the British Virgin Islands in 2013.
Our line of silicone gel-filled breast implants, branded as Motiva Implants, is the centerpiece of our medical technology platform. Our post-market surveillance data (which was not generated in connection with a United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, pre-market approval, or PMA, study, but was patient or practitioner reported rather than collected at defined follow-ups) and published third-party data indicates that Motiva Implants show low rates of adverse events (including rupture, capsular contracture, and safety related reoperations) that we believe compare favorably with those of our competitors. We believe the proprietary technologies that differentiate our Motiva Implants enable improved safety and aesthetic outcomes and drive our revenue growth. We have developed other complementary products and services, which are aimed at further enhancing patient outcomes.
Since launching Motiva Implants in October 2010, the majority of our revenue has been generated from sales of our Motiva Implants in cash pay, non-reimbursable, breast augmentation procedures. To date, our Motiva Implants are registered to be sold in more than 80 countries outside of the United States. We currently sell our products via exclusive distributors or our direct sales force (which accounted for approximately 43% of our revenue in 2021) and have introduced five generations of Motiva Implants. We currently commercially sell four product families: (i) Round and Ergonomix Round, (ii) Ergonomix Oval, (iii) Anatomical TrueFixation and (iv) Ergonomix2. Our products incorporate first of-its-kind safety features including: (i) SmoothSilk / SilkSurface (an optimized biocompatible advanced smooth surface that is designed to reduce capsular contracture), (ii) Qid RFID technology (a non-invasive, readable serial number that enables product identification and enhances safety and patient peace of mind), (iii) BluSeal visual barrier layer (a proprietary indicator that allows for verification of complete barrier layer presence) and (iv) TrueMonobloc gel-shell-patch configuration (a highly durable, easy-to-insert performance shell that allows for smaller incisions and smaller scars).
Recent Developments
In April 2021, we completed the enrollment in our one hundred patient Motiva MIA clinical case series in Costa Rica. The Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approved study began in December 2020 subsequent to the initial 2019 case series in Asia. Fifteen board-certified plastic surgeons from Costa Rica, Sweden, England, Brazil, Austria, Italy, Belgium, and the United States participated in the case series. The single-center study is a prospective, single-arm, feasibility study of women 18 years or older in primary minimally invasive breast enhancement. 
The Motiva MIA system is designed to provide a minimally invasive breast enhancement procedure in less time and with faster recovery than traditional breast surgery. We have received registration in Costa Rica and a Free Sales Certificate, or FSC, for the components of the Motiva MIA system to begin regulatory approval processes worldwide. The Ergonomix2 Diamond implant used with Motiva MIA obtained CE marking in December 2020 and we have submitted the tools used in the Motiva MIA procedure for CE mark.
In June 2021, we held the groundbreaking ceremony for our new Sulàyöm Innovation Campus in Costa Rica. When complete, the new facility will total approximately 170,000 square feet (16,000 square meters) and will support the company’s continued global growth with additional capacity and capabilities in manufacturing, research and development, or R&D, digital media, training, and medical education. The new campus will be completed in two phases with the first phase expected to cost approximately $35 million. Construction of the new building began following finalization and execution of certain contractual arrangements. The initial phase of the construction of the cold-shell structure is being funded by the Coyol Free Zone, with Establishment Labs having the option to purchase the land and cold shell building. The new facilities will be located in the Coyol Free Zone in Costa Rica and we expect they will add up to 1,000 new jobs over the next several years.
In September 2021, we launched Motiva Flora tissue expander in Europe and other CE mark countries. The Motiva Flora tissue expander offers several notable innovations, including our patented SmoothSilk surface technology, as well as an RFID-enabled, non-magnetic integrated port, both of which offer potential improvements in imaging, treatment, overall clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. 
In October 2021, we announced the launch of JOY, a new patient-centric breast aesthetics program. Women who select JOY will receive Establishment Labs’ newest generation Motiva Ergonomix2 implants through a network of highly trained plastic surgeons, as well as, what we believe to be, the most comprehensive patient support program available in the industry. Ergonomix2 incorporates our latest innovations, including our most advanced ultra-high purity chemistries for enhanced device mechanical properties and improved patient ergonomics. Ergonomix2 also features our patented SmoothSilk surface technology, which is the basis of Motiva Implants’ low inflammatory characteristics that have contributed to the lowest capsular contracture rates in the industry. Ergonomix2 has CE mark labeling for use in both aesthetic and reconstruction procedures. JOY includes the Motiva Woman’s Choice Program. This first-of-its-kind program allows women with JOY, subject to certain terms and conditions, to receive financial support from Establishment Labs should they choose to have their implants removed. Women with JOY may also have the option to visit surgeons who commit to reversing the procedure at no additional cost. In addition to the Woman’s Choice Program, JOY also includes Establishment Labs’ Always Confident Warranty, the Motiva 5-Year Extended Warranty, and other benefits.
The Motiva Ergonomix2 implants included with JOY offer all the features of our Ergonomix implants, including SmoothSilk surface technology, ProgressiveGel Ultimate, and RFID enablement, as well as several new technologies, including Motiva SuperSilicones, TrueMonobloc+, and BluSeal+. These advances offer enhanced ergonomy, extra soft feel, and more natural movement. Motiva Ergonomix2 implants are available exclusively through the JOY program.
In February 2019, the FDA granted clearance on the 510(k) submitted for the Motiva Intraoperative Sizers. Sizers are used in breast augmentation or reconstruction procedures to assist in determining the desired breast implant volume and projection before implantation. These devices are part of the platform to support the IDE study and in preparation for the potential PMA approval and commercialization of Motiva Implants in the USA.
In March 2018, we received approval of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, from the FDA to initiate our Motiva Implants clinical trial in the United States for the Motiva Round and Motiva Ergonomix Round product families and the first patient was enrolled in the study in April 2018. In March 2019, we filed our first annual report with the FDA, and our IDE study-defined enrollment targets for the aesthetic cohorts, which include primary augmentation and revision augmentation, had been reached with a total of 450 and 100 subjects, respectively. In August 2019, we announced completion of all surgeries in the aesthetic cohorts. In August 2019, we also announced that we were implementing a bifurcated regulatory strategy in the United States, designed to allow us to initiate rolling submission of data in a PMA from the primary augmentation and revision augmentation cohorts to the FDA, to be supplemented by data from the reconstruction cohorts. We are continuing to enroll subjects in the remaining reconstruction cohorts and plan to complete enrollment of 800 patients in total in the study in fiscal year 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated a modular PMA submission process with the FDA and submitted the first of four expected modules. According to current FDA guidance, a minimum of three years of premarket PMA data must be submitted to support approval of standard silicone gel breast implants; however, the appropriate length of time for collection of premarket study data will be determined by the FDA on a case-by-case basis for each implant after careful consideration of all available clinical and non-clinical data. 
Our Market
Breast Augmentation 
Breast augmentation surgery remains the leading aesthetic surgical procedure by number of procedures globally. Approximately 1.6 million breast augmentations were performed worldwide in 2020, according to International 
Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, or ISAPS. The following table lists the top markets by country for total breast augmentations in 2020 according to ISAPS. 

Total Breast Augmentation Procedures 
Rank * | Country | Procedures | Percentage of World-Wide Total
 | United States | 371,997 | 22.9% 
 | Brazil | 172,485 | 10.6% 
 | Germany | 67,634 | 4.2%

* Rankings are based solely on those countries from which a sufficient survey response was received and data was considered to be representative. 

Breast Reconstruction
The American Society of Plastic Surgeons noted in their Plastic Surgery Statistics Report that 137,808 breast reconstructions were performed in 2020. We estimate the 2020 global market was approximately $400 million. The breast reconstruction market is expected to grow and reach approximately $600 million by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 7% according to Markets and Markets’ May 2020 Breast Reconstruction Market - Global Forecast to 2025 report due to a combination of increasing incidences of breast cancer and rising awareness of post-mastectomy options available.
Traditional Breast Implants and Their Limitations 
Despite the global demand for breast augmentation procedures, there has been relatively little innovation since the 1990s. In 1992, due to emerging safety concerns, the FDA placed a moratorium on sales of silicone breast implants in the United States that was lifted in 2006. This, combined with the ongoing FDA requirement for a PMA on all new breast implants, has discouraged breast implant innovation over the past 30 years. Current products have relatively high adverse event rates, and we believe many do not mimic natural breast tissue. The table below contains key adverse event information from published data from their 10-year prospective clinical trials conducted by the only three companies currently approved to market silicone breast implants in the United States. 
Results from primary augmentations

 | Sientra10-Year | Allergan10-Year | Mentor10-Year 
Number of Patients | N=1,116 Patients | N=455 Patients | N=552 Patients

Capsular Contracture | 12.9% | 18.9% | 12.1% 
Reoperation | 24.0% | 36.1% | 25.5% 
Kaplan-Meier risk rates were the primary method of analysis for the above data. This table represents the final data from the primary cohort of the same study referenced in the above five- and six-year PMA studies conducted by our competitors. This 10-year data for Sientra, Allergan and Mentor were released in 2018, 2018, and 2015, respectively.
(1) The rupture rates represent the MRI cohort only for each respective study, which consisted of 571 patients for Sientra, 158 patients for Allergan and 202 patients for Mentor. 

We believe that the improved appearance, feel and patient safety profile of our Motiva Implants provides a strong competitive advantage that will help us to both capture market share and achieve higher patient conversion rates by addressing the key concerns described by patients who choose not to pursue breast augmentation surgery.
Our Competitive Strengths
▪Patient-centric innovative implant technologies. We have developed our Motiva Implants by enhancing and creating novel product components for our implants, and then combining these components into products that deliver improved aesthetic outcomes, increased patient satisfaction and favorable safety profiles. 
▪Extensive suite of complementary products and services. Our product portfolio includes innovative products and tools. We believe our designed surgical procedures, such as MotivaHybrid, Motiva MinimalScar and Motiva MIA, will address key unmet needs for both the physician and the patient. 
▪Proprietary internal manufacturing processes and capabilities. We manufacture our silicone products in state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Costa Rica rather than relying on third-party manufacturers. In these facilities, we utilize our novel 3D imprinted molding method to create proprietary surface features that, in combination with other proprietary materials and methods, differentiate our products from those of our competitors. Our two manufacturing sites have gone through full site inspections and audits under the Medical Device Single Audit Program, or MDSAP, which were carried out by the British Standards Institute, or BSI, an agency which the FDA accepts as a substitute for routine agency inspections. We believe our modern facilities, focus on product quality and deep technological expertise have helped us establish and maintain a brand of consistency, quality and safety. 
▪Dynamic worldwide sales platform. We sell our products both through exclusive arrangements with leading local distributors who have strong local surgeon relationships and our direct sales force in key markets such as Brazil and primary markets in Europe. Using this market-specific approach, we have built an effective and efficient worldwide sales platform.
▪Proven management team with expansive industry experience. We have a highly experienced management team that is comprised of leaders from the medical aesthetic market. 
Our Growth Strategy
Our goal is to be the global leader in aesthetic surgical implant technology, including breast implants, while improving patient safety through product innovation. The key elements of our strategy include:
▪Expand revenues in existing markets. We believe we can continue to grow market share in our existing markets due to the favorable safety profile and improved aesthetic outcomes of our Motiva Implants. 
▪Launch Motiva Implants in additional markets outside the United States. We expect that continued geographic expansion will be a key driver of growth in the near term. In recent years, we started sales through distributors in Australia, Israel, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand and South Korea, as well as starting direct sales in Brazil, the second largest market for breast augmentations. Expansion into China is expected as early as the second half of 2022.
▪Obtain FDA approval and enter the U.S. market. We are conducting our IDE clinical trial in the United States, with the goal of obtaining approval from the FDA for a premarket application and commercializing our Motiva Implants in the United States. All surgeries have been completed in the aesthetic cohorts. We are continuing to enroll subjects in the remaining primary reconstruction cohort and plan to complete enrollment of a total of 800 patients in the study across 40 sites in the United States, Germany, and Sweden in fiscal 2022. 
▪Optimize patient conversion through sales and marketing programs. We employ a multi-faceted marketing strategy that includes social media engagement, conference presence, online advertising and patient and physician education. This approach enables us to engage with and educate patients on the Motiva brand and the benefits of our products, as well as increase clinical efficiency for our physician collaborators. In the future, we expect our social media and online patient and physician education to have important strategic synergies with our designed surgeries, which are promoted globally. 
▪Seek out and pursue strategic acquisitions. We intend to seek out other innovative products, services and procedures that satisfy unmet needs in the aesthetics space and complement our existing product portfolio as we believe this can be additive to future revenue growth. We have purchased distributor networks in strategic markets and may acquire other third-party sales organizations in the future. While we have no specific acquisitions or planned licensing agreements currently ongoing, we may engage in 
these, or other strategic transactions, with the goal of augmenting our existing product portfolio and global footprint.
▪Continue a high level of engagement with key opinion leaders. We promote Motiva Implants, in part, via an extensive and robust calendar of physician education events led by key opinion leaders in the field of aesthetic surgery. In 2021 and 2020, we conducted 206 and 126 events, respectively, through our medical educational platform. We also collaborate actively with respected and influential key opinion leader surgeons to identify and develop new clinical applications for our existing products, as well as new product and strategic opportunities.

Motiva Implants
The Motiva breast implants are a class III medical device indicated for breast augmentation and breast reconstruction, including revision surgeries to correct or improve the result of a primary breast augmentation surgery. We launched Motiva Implants commercially in October 2010, and to date we have sold approximately 2.0 million units in various countries outside the United States. Motiva Implants incorporate several proprietary features that we believe contribute to Motiva Implants’ favorable safety profile, natural appearance and feel. Our latest generation of Motiva Implants utilizes our proprietary Gravity Sensitive Ergonomix design, with a round base 
implant that responds to gravity by shifting its maximum point of projection, offering the more “natural” projection of a shaped implant without the malposition and rotation issues frequently associated with shaped implants. Furthermore, our fill material with the ProgressiveGel platform of silicone gel rheologies consists of highly purified biocompatible gels with specific visco-elastic properties that we believe enables Motiva Implants to respond to the patient’s motion in ways that more closely mimic the appearance, feel and movement of natural breast tissue. Our catalog includes over 1,000 product variations, with round, oval and anatomical shapes, two different surfaces, SmoothSilk and VelvetSurface, and volumes ranging from 95cc to 1060cc, resulting in a wider range of options than those offered by our major competitors.

Ergonomix2 incorporates the latest innovations, including our most advanced ultra-high purity chemistries for enhanced device safety mechanical properties and improved patient ergonomics. Ergonomix2 also features our patented SmoothSilk surface technology, which is the basis of Motiva Implants’ low inflammatory characteristics that have contributed to the lowest capsular contracture rates in the industry. Ergonomix2 was CE marked in December 2020 and labeled for use in both aesthetic and reconstruction procedures.
Shell Surface: SilkSurface/SmoothSilk    
The surface topography of the breast implant shell surface varies between commercially available breast implants. Our SmoothSilk surface was designed to improve biocompatibility and to provide for same surface topography around the entire implant for the benefit of the patients. The International Standard Organization, or ISO, through the new April 2018 standard (ISO 14607:2018), created a classification of implant surface textures according to roughness. This standard includes an objective way of defining the difference between smooth, micro and macro surfaces based on roughness average. The topology of SilkSurface/SmoothSilk is characterized under the smooth category, having a low roughness value of approximately 3.09 microns with thousands of contact features per square centimeter, which is significantly lower than the higher limit of the smooth surface clarification defined by ISO.
Our retrospective implant data shows that Motiva Implants have a lower rate of capsular contracture and seromas when compared to available published data from competitors. We believe that these results are due in large part to the proprietary surface of our Motiva Implants. Our proprietary shell surfaces are smoother and have more regular surface features than those of our primary competitors based on several studies using methods such as scanning electron microscopy, profilometry testing and statistical parameters comparisons.
A 2021 published study in Nature Biomedical Engineering led by Professor Robert Langer, Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) at David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, indicated that our SmoothSilk can largely suppress the foreign body response and fibrosis provoking the least amount of inflammation in comparison with the other commercially available surfaces. A larger percentage of macrophages in the cell mix indicates an inflammatory response, which is an early step in capsule formation. We believe the more moderate inflammatory response observed on SmoothSilk is responsible for improved biocompatibility and lower complication rates. 
In addition, an abstract presented in 2017 by researchers at Montana State University showed less accumulation of both bacteria and biofilm on SmoothSilk in vitro when compared to smoother and textured surfaces. Biofilm formed on implant surfaces increases the risk of bacteria accumulation and capsule formation.
In December 2018, we commissioned an independent report from the French reference laboratory Laboratoire National de Metrologie et d’Essais, or LNE, on the surface characteristics of our Motiva Implants. Based upon its testing, LNE concluded that the SmoothSilk shell surface in the Motiva Implants is considered a smooth surface as defined by ISO 14607:2018 categorization.
The graph below shows how the size of our surface features compares with those of our competitors. 
ProgressiveGel Family
The proprietary silicone chemistries that comprise our ProgressiveGel family allow for a high degree of cohesiveness and strength but add characteristics such as softness and high ductility that enable movement dynamics more like that of natural breast tissue. We believe that the cohesive properties reduce the likelihood of silicone gel leakage in the event of a rupture in the shell. The strength of the gel is believed to contribute to a reduced frequency of gel fracture, a condition which leads to deformed implant shape and stress on the implant’s shell. While other manufacturers have claimed a “high strength” gel, ours combines a notably high elasticity (the ability to stretch without permanent deformation) with low viscosity, both of which reduce the susceptibility of the implants to rupture while improving their tactile feel and movement dynamics. Additionally, the improved adhesion of the gel to the shell structure avoids the appearance of separation spots, an aesthetic defect commonly seen in competitor products.
In addition to the safety advantages, our ProgressiveGel family, provides for movement characteristics that resemble natural breast tissue. Our later generation Ergonomix products, further mimic natural tissue, with a maximum point of projection that shifts downward to create a natural human breast shape when a patient is standing. This allows our Motiva Implants to provide the more natural aesthetics of “shaped” or “teardrop” implants without the risk of associated drawbacks such as breast deformation from rotation and unnaturally hard tactile feel. The images below illustrate the implants’ ability to change shape depending on the patient’s positioning.
TrueMonobloc 
Our TrueMonobloc technology, which is incorporated into all generations of Motiva Implants currently sold, combines proprietary chemistry with our proprietary manufacturing techniques to create a shell, gel and other components that are tightly bound to one another. This results in an implant that is more homogeneously elastic and resistant to separation of the gel from the shell, addressing one type of implant failure that can lead to shell ruptures and silicone leaks. This also enables Motiva Implants to be stretched and squeezed to a more significant degree, which we believe currently enables breast augmentation through incision sizes smaller than one inch, compared with the published industry norm of approximately two inches. A surgical technique that we have developed, which we call Motiva Minimally Invasive Augmentation, or Motiva MIA, utilizes our next-generation Ergonomix2 Diamond implant to take advantage of these physical properties to enable a less-invasive procedure for the patient. The implants associated with Motiva MIA received CE Mark approval in December 2020. Instruments and special accessory devices for the Motiva MIA procedure have been developed and are currently awaiting regulatory approval prior to commercialization. The following image shows that TrueMonobloc enables significant manipulation of a Motiva Implant without separation of gel from shell.
RFID Technology
We offer a Radio-Frequency Identification Device microtransponder (also referred to as Qid) that is placed in the filling gel as an optional feature for all implant styles. This microtransponder provides each device with a unique electronic serial number for traceability purposes.
The microtransponder contains only a unique 15-digit code that identifies the product and does not contain any patient information. This microtransponder can be read with a simple pass from our non-invasive and inexpensive reading device, the Qid Safety Technology Reader, and the serial number corresponds with related information in our MotivaImagine database such as implant type, size and other characteristics. Patients can create a secure account, register the products and include applicable patient information either through the MotivaImagine application or our website, to access their implant information. The MotivaImagine application and Motiva Implants website also allow the patient to access the implant warranty information. This traceability is intended to give patients comfort that any future recalls can be positively identified as applying, or not applying, to that patient’s particular implant. This addresses a key concern that often discourages women who are otherwise interested in implants from making the choice to move forward with the surgery. Motiva Implants are currently the 
only breast implants on the international market with Qid Safety Technology; however, we believe there is an opportunity to sell these microtransponders to other medical device companies in the space.
Each implant’s unique electronic serial number is encoded into the RFID circuitry as part of a three-point authentication system: the microtransponder, the reader and the database. This authentication system prevents unauthorized access to any personal information of the patient and is compliant with FDA regulations. 
We also believe that additional functionality can be added to this microtransponder platform. Future potential applications currently under development include temperature sensing as a means of infection detection or pressure sensing as a means of detection of shell rupture. 
BluSeal
The Motiva Implant shell is constructed of successive layers of silicone elastomer and a low diffusion barrier layer. The key function of the low diffusion barrier is to prevent diffusion of low molecular weight siloxane species from the implant to the tissues. This barrier layer embeds our BluSeal indicator technology, which is a key feature used during the manufacturing process to verify that the barrier is present in a uniform way around the entire shell. It is also used as a visual quality control and safety measure to minimize potential gel diffusion. This patented manufacturing innovation is intended to highlight any imperfections in the barrier layer coverage with a distinct color. Our BluSeal indicator technology also provides the plastic surgeon with the ability to verify whether the barrier layer has coverage defects or other imperfections before implantation that might lead to post-implantation shell rupture or gel bleed. We believe this is another safety innovation that contributes to our substantially lower reported implant rupture rates as compared to reports for our primary competitors.
Motiva Flora Tissue Expander
The Motiva Flora Tissue Expander is used in breast reconstruction surgery for temporary implantation (less than six months) to gradually expand the breast tissue prior to the placement of a long-term breast implant. After implantation, the device is periodically filled with saline solution via an injection port to increase its volume in order to stretch the skin and create a pocket for breast implant placement. The injection port is dome-shaped and 
includes an RFID coil, which can be accurately located utilizing the port locator. The Motiva Flora Tissue Expander is the only tissue expander in the market with an integrated RFID port with no magnets, allowing for use of the expander safely alongside MRI scanning. The Motiva Flora received CE mark in June 2020 and has been registered in 33 countries. Motiva Flora also includes the SmoothSilk surface, which provides biocompatibility benefits described above. Our catalog includes 15 variations, including three different heights, and a range of volumes from 260 to 995 cc.
Motiva MIA System for Minimally Invasive Augmentation 
We are also developing Motiva MIA — a patient centric procedure designed to allow breast augmentation to be performed under local anesthesia rather than general anesthesia, through smaller incisions, with faster recovery times and a resulting reduction in surgical complications. The Motiva MIA system includes the specially-designed Ergonomix2 Diamond implant, which received CE mark in December 2020, and its proprietary tools, including the Motiva MIA Inflatable Balloon and the Motiva MIA Injector. We received registration in Costa Rica and a Free Sales Certificate, or FSC, for the Motiva MIA devices and we are submitting for regulatory approvals worldwide. Based on third-party commissioned market research, we believe Motiva MIA will be able to attract new customers and expand the market for breast aesthetic procedures.
Puregraft - Autologous Fat Augmentation 
Adipose (fat) tissue removed from one area of a patient’s body can be re-injected under the skin of the face, breasts, or in other areas where augmentation and shaping are desired. In the breast augmentation context, there is an unmet need for predictable contouring around the edges of the breast, both with and without volume augmentation via silicone implants. Puregraft LLC’s line of products provides surgeons with a tool for additional contouring around breast implants, which we call MotivaHybrid when used in combination with Motiva Implants and a 3D pre-surgical scan.
MotivaImagine Centers
We utilize our MotivaImagine Center initiative, which are collaborations with plastic surgery clinics whereby we provide them with access to our technologies and the ability to brand themselves as a MotivaImagine Center. In exchange for these services and use of the Motiva branding, each MotivaImagine Center commits to invest in providing prospective patients with a technologically advanced educational experience featuring Motiva Implants and other products in the MotivaImagine product platform. 
Designed Surgeries
Our suite of products and technologies enables surgical techniques that we intend to develop and promote as “designed surgeries.” Our first such designed surgery, MotivaHybrid, combines 3D pre-surgical assessment of existing breast tissue volume using a 3D scanning system, together with additional contouring using adipose tissue for more natural balanced results and improved patient satisfaction. 
Our second designed surgery, Motiva MinimalScar, allows surgeons to significantly reduce the size of the surgical incision. We have developed Motiva MIA — a family of designed surgeries that enhance breast augmentation in a 
safer, faster and more predictable way through a small and inconspicuous scar hidden in the axilla. We intend for Motiva MIA to allow breast augmentation procedures to be performed without general anesthesia with faster recovery times and a resulting reduction in surgical complications. In December 2020, we received a CE mark for our Motiva Ergonomix2 Diamond breast implant, which is the implant that will be used in the Motiva MIA procedure. In early 2021, we completed enrollment in our one hundred patient Motiva MIA case series in Costa Rica. The IRB approach study began in December 2020 and one year follow up will be completed in early 2022. Instruments and special accessory devices for the Motiva MIA procedure have been developed and are currently awaiting regulatory approvals prior to commercialization in specific regions. Based on third-party commissioned market research, we believe Motiva MIA will be able to attract new customers and expand the market for breast aesthetic procedures. 
Our Clinical Data 
11-Year Safety Post-Market Surveillance Data 
Dating from the commercial launch of Motiva Implants in October 2010 through December 2021, we have sold approximately 2.0 million breast implants in various countries outside the United States and Canada. We maintain a Quality Management System database to log all complaints received from patients or physicians. From October 2010 through December 2021, a total of 2,094 complaints have been reported, investigated and processed, representing approximately 0.1% of the total Motiva Implants sold through December 2021. There were no reported cases of late seroma, double capsule formation or anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, or ALCL, in this data set, and there were 16 cases of early seroma. The table below shows the rates of rupture, capsular contracture and reoperation for adverse events of our Motiva Implants from the data gathered through December 2021. In contrast to the above competitor data, our data is self-reported rather than collected at mandatory follow-ups and was generated solely for our post-market surveillance instead of in connection with a FDA PMA study. All of these patients were located outside the United States.

Independent Clinical Experience
An independent study by Sforza et al., published in the peer-reviewed Aesthetic Surgery Journal in 2017, conducted at a single center, the Hospital Group Ltd.’s Dolan Park Clinic, or Dolan Park, in Bromsgrove, England, between April 2013 and April 2016, reported 5,813 consecutive cases of breast augmentation with Motiva Implants. This independent study was commissioned by Dolan Park’s medical director, Dr. Sforza, who is also a member of our medical advisory board and receives compensation from us in such capacity. The study, conducted by a group of 16 plastic surgeons at Dolan Park, reported overall rates of complication and reoperation of 0.76% over an interval of three years. Beginning in March of 2014, we started supplying our products to Dolan Park under a series of long-term supply agreements with Dolan Park’s affiliated companies. The last supply agreement expired in July of 2019. There were no serious adverse events and no cases of implant rupture for device failure, capsular contracture (Baker III/IV) in primary cases, double capsules, or late seromas. The authors presented consistent real-world data and believe that their free, three-year aftercare system is a strong method for patient retention and follow-up by eliminating any financial limitations for patients to return for follow-up consultations if any issues occur. Anecdotally, the same group of surgeons utilizing the same aftercare system for the last seven years reported substantially different results utilizing other types of silicone breast implants (i.e., non-Motiva Implants). The overall revision rate for this group from 2010 to 2013 utilizing a different, macro-textured, FDA approved implant (N > 10,000) was 8.43%, which is more than 10 times higher than the rate for Motiva Implants reported in this analysis.

Study to Support a PMA 
We are conducting a prospective IDE clinical trial in the United States on our Motiva Round and Motiva Ergonomix Round product families. Our IDE request was approved by the FDA on March 20, 2018 to perform a single open-label, multi-center trial, with follow-up visits available at the time of filing. We will continue to monitor patients for ten years post-implantation. The primary endpoints of the trial will be safety, effectiveness and patient satisfaction. In general, our trial design and patient enrollment are consistent with prior PMA studies conducted by Allergan, Mentor, and Sientra. In August 2019, we announced that we were implementing a bifurcated regulatory strategy in the United States, which is designed to allow us to initiate the rolling submission of data to the FDA from the primary augmentation and revision augmentation cohorts, and then subsequently supplement our PMA with data from the reconstruction cohorts. All the surgeries had been completed in the aesthetics cohort, which include primary augmentation and revision augmentation, with a total of 450 and 100 subjects, respectively. We are continuing to enroll subjects in the remaining reconstruction cohort and plan to enroll a total of 800 patients in the study across 40 sites in the United States, Germany, and Sweden in fiscal year 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated a modular PMA submission process with the FDA and submitted the first of four expected modules.
Sales and Marketing
We primarily derive revenue from sales of our Motiva Implants from two types of customers: (1) medical distributors and (2) direct sales to physicians, hospitals, and clinics. Our products are commercially available in more than 80 countries through exclusive distributors, except in Brazil and several European countries where we sell through our direct sales force. As of December 31, 2021, our sales organization included 117 employees and contractors. All of these sales personnel are supported through a suite of tools, including marketing and training materials, mobile smartphone applications, and access to a robust schedule of physician education events. We also pay significant attention to helping our distributors maintain positive relationships with surgeons and clinics in their respective regions, and to positioning our product in the marketplace as a premium product with consequent premium pricing.
We demonstrate our confidence in Motiva Implants with the Motiva Always Confident Warranty, which offers patients a free replacement for any Motiva Implant that ruptures, for the life of the product. We also replace any implant which is replaced due to capsular contracture of Baker Grade III or IV severity at any time in the first 10 years post-implantation. We also offer an extended warranty at additional cost outside the JOY program, which provides financial assistance of up to $2,500 to cover surgical costs resulting from rupture or capsular contracture. 
We employ a multi-faceted marketing strategy that includes social media engagement, conferences, advertisements and education.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends at least in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections. 
We have assembled a broad portfolio of intellectual property related to our medical device and aesthetics products. We believe this intellectual property, combined with proprietary manufacturing processes and the regulatory approvals we have successfully obtained outside of the United States, provides us with a strong market position. As of December 31, 2021, we own or have rights to 17 issued and 19 pending patents in the United States related to various aspects of our Motiva Implants (such as implant barrier layers, surface texture technology, minimally invasive implant delivery systems, and our Qid Safety Technology radio frequency identification devices). In addition, we own or have rights to 12 issued, two allowed and 85 pending foreign applications and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications. Our owned and licensed patents are expected to expire at various times between February 2025 and February 2039. Our owned and licensed pending applications, if granted, likely would expire between September 2033 and January 2042.
In addition to pursuing patents on our products, we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners, and, when needed, our advisors. Such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. 
In general, the medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent allegations and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Third parties, including our competitor companies, may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our partners or our customers. Our standard license and other agreements may obligate us to indemnify our partners and customers against such claims. We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending against any such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from selling or distributing certain products or performing certain services, require us to expend time and resources to develop non-infringing products, or force us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents-royalties or other fees. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
Research and Development 
Our goal is to continue to improve our existing products, as well as develop new products and new surgical techniques. We have a highly experienced team and deep customer and key opinion leader relationships. We also have sophisticated internal prototyping and testing equipment. As a result, we have introduced five distinct generations of Motiva Implant product since October 2010, with innovative features added to each successive generation. Further, our efforts included work on both a tissue expander for reconstruction, for which we received a CE Mark in June 2020 and our next generation Ergonomix2 Diamond implant for minimally invasive procedures, for which we received a CE Mark in December 2020.
We have and will continue to work with several institutions in our effort to advance implant technology, and generate additional scientific data to support the improved safety outcomes associated with our products, including:
▪Massachusetts Institute of Technology
▪Medical University of Innsbruck 
▪Plastic and Reconstructive Research Center at the University of Manchester 
▪Center for Biofilm Engineering of Montana State University 
▪The Chair of Plastic Surgery at the School of Medicine and Psychology of Sapienza University of Rome 
▪Microscopic Structure Research Center of the University of Costa Rica
We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant R&D expenses. Our R&D expenses increased $4.5 million, or 32.8%, to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our R&D expenses consist of costs associated with our clinical and post-approval studies, regulatory activity and product development, including the development of Motiva Implants and other current and future aesthetic and reconstruction surgical devices on our product platform. 
Implantable RFID Microtransponder Platform
The RFID technology platform that we use in the Qid feature of our Motiva Implants is independently cleared as a system via the FDA’s 510(k) pathway. We are developing more sophisticated functionality using this technology platform. We believe our RFID technology will be an attractive platform for a variety of other applications, including unique device identification for other types of implantable medical devices, functional implantable biosensors, and diagnostic monitoring. Future specific indications include detection of device life cycles (e.g., flexion/contraction cycles for artificial hip and knee joints) and monitoring of analytes such as circulating tumor cells and blood chemistry components. Some of these applications we may choose to develop and commercialize internally, while others may be more appropriately commercialized via partnerships with other medical device companies. 
We control all the activities of the development and manufacturing of our Qid Safety Technology RFID transponders. This allows us for adapting to specific needs or new developments in our field.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
Facilities
We manufacture our products in ISO-13485-certified manufacturing facilities located in the Coyol Free Zone office park in Costa Rica, a park populated by a number of international medical device companies and granted tax-advantaged status by the government of Costa Rica. Our newest and largest manufacturing facility opened at the end of 2016 and we began shipping manufactured product from this facility in March 2017. This facility has approximately 28,000 square feet of office space and production areas which are capable of producing over 400,000 implants a year, with state-of-the-art support systems for sustaining production, including an ice-bank system for cooling the controlled air in the clean room and support areas, water-lubricated air compressors for eliminating the presence of oil particulates, heat recovery systems for energy saving, and an energy micro-grid comprised of solar panels and energy-storage batteries. These energy efficient systems generate up to 80% of the total energy consumption of the building, which received LEED Gold Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council in August 2017. Our initial facility was established in 2009 and has about 3,000 square feet of production areas, capable of producing over 100,000 implants a year. 
We continue to look for ways to improve manufacturing processes and facility organization to increase capacity in these two current facilities. We completed an internal assessment and identified the potential additional manufacturing capacity of approximately 250,000 implants per year, which we added during fiscal 2021, thereby increasing the efficiencies in our process flow.
In July 2017, both facilities received the MDSAP regulatory certification. MDSAP was established by a coalition of international medical device regulatory authorities including Australia’s TGA, Brazil’s ANVISA, Health Canada, Japan’s MHLW and PMDA and the U.S. FDA. The goal of MDSAP is to allow a single regulatory audit of a medical device manufacturer’s Quality Management System to satisfy the needs of the participating regulatory jurisdictions. This program enables manufacturers to contract with an authorized third-party auditing organization, in our case the British Standards Institute, to conduct a single audit to satisfy the relevant regulatory requirements of the participating regulatory authorities including the FDA, which recognizes MDSAP audit reports as a substitute for FDA Establishment Inspection Reports.
In May 2019, both of our facilities in Coyol Free Zone received the Carbon Neutral certification from the Costa Rican Ministry of Environment, Energy, and Telecommunications, based on the implementation of efficiency-aimed actions such as the reduction of energy consumption through the acquisition of more efficient equipment; the combined use of solar panels, ice banks, and battery storage units; and the avoidance of fossil fuels for our operations.
We are also subject to periodic inspections and audits by various international regulatory and notified bodies, and we believe our past performance in these audits reflects the strength of our quality system and manufacturing controls. We consider this to be a key element of our risk management and business continuity strategies and a competitive advantage as we have full control of the product lifecycle. Our in-house manufacturing team includes 
over 460 employees, all of whom undergo well defined training programs throughout their period of employment. We believe our manufacturing experience, know-how, and process-related trade secrets are also a competitive advantage. 
We are in the process of expanding our manufacturing facilities and corporate offices in the Coyol Free Zone in Costa Rica. The initial $35.3 million project estimate includes approximately 145,000 square feet of facility space and would initially increase our manufacturing capacity by approximately 400,000 units per year, and potentially increase capacity by 800,000 units with an additional incremental $4.6 million investment in manufacturing equipment for a total facility space of approximately 170,000 square feet. We held the groundbreaking ceremony for our new Sulàyöm Innovation Campus in Costa Rica in the second quarter of 2021. Construction on the new building began following finalization and execution of certain contractual arrangements in the third quarter of 2021. The initial phase of construction of the cold-shell structure is being funded by the Coyol Free Zone, with Establishment Labs having the option to purchase the land and cold shell building. See Note 3, “Balance Sheet Accounts” for additional information regarding this construction project and our right to purchase the title to the land and cold shell building currently under construction.
Process
We produce our shell surfaces using a novel 3D negative imprinting molding technique that allows much more precise control over feature size, a uniform distribution of features on the surface, no particles creation, and less unit-to-unit variation. Our primary competitors utilize the “salt-loss” technique or “polyurethane foam imprint” technique. The “salt-loss” technique blows crystals of salt or sugar onto the uncured silicone shell in order to produce surface texture and the “polyurethane foam imprint” technique uses a foreign material to press against the last uncured silicone layer to produce surface features. We believe our 3D negative imprinting technique is more efficient and consistent than the techniques used by our competitors because the application of our advanced smooth surface is integrated with the molding process, rather than requiring a separate, subsequent process. 
Suppliers
We source manufacturing inputs from a number of outside suppliers. In particular, we obtain NuSil brand medical-grade silicone from Avantor (previously NuSil Technology LLC), which is a sole-source supplier of such product to the entire silicone breast implant industry. In 2016, we entered into a new supply agreement with NuSil-Avantor, which provides for specified prices per unit of each relevant component; the contract was extended through March 31, 2022 while a new supply agreement is being finalized.
Other critical materials are the silicone patches and other silicone components used for the assembly of our breast implants. All these components are also made with NuSil medical-grade silicone and manufactured by specialized silicone contract manufacturing suppliers. All component suppliers undergo strict quality inspections to ensure these can meet our quality standard. Other important components are the primary packaging polycarbonate trays, the Tyvek sealing lids and packaging. All these components are also critical to maintain integrity of the product throughout its shelf-life and all these suppliers must be qualified and materials must be validated prior to being approved for manufacturing activities. Most suppliers are evaluated annually, and we carry second source supplier activities to ensure business continuity and quality and costs improvement. 
Competition
The market for silicone breast implants is relatively concentrated, within Allergan Aesthetics, a division of AbbVie, and Mentor Worldwide LLC, a division of Johnson & Johnson. In the United States, Sientra, Inc. is the only other company with an approved silicone implant product. Internationally, the market is more fragmented, with GC Aesthetics plc, Silimed, Inc., Groupe Sebbin SAS, Hans Biomed Crop., Polytech Health & Aesthetics, and Arion Laboratories.
Our major competitors in the silicone breast implant marketplace are either publicly traded companies or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies with significantly more market share and resources than we have. These companies have greater financial resources for sales, marketing and product development, broader established relationships with health care providers and third-party payors, and larger and more established distribution networks. In some instances, our competitors also offer products that include features that we do not currently offer in all geographies. Our competitors also have regulatory approval to market and sell their products in countries where we currently do not, notably the United States. In addition, our competitors may offer pricing programs with discounts across their non-breast aesthetic product portfolios.
We also face potential future competition from a number of companies, medical researchers and existing medical device companies that may be pursuing new implant technologies. These include non-implant breast augmentation through injections of autologous adipose tissue, new material technologies such as synthetic fillers, and new methods of enhancing and reconstructing the breast. 
We believe the primary competitive factors in our current and future markets include:
▪safety and outcomes data generated in clinical studies;
▪regulatory approvals;    
▪technological characteristics of products;
▪complementary platforms of non-implant products, such as facial fillers and fat grafting technologies;
▪product price;
▪customer service; and
▪support by key opinion leaders.
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
Breast implants are regulated as Class III medical devices in the United States, and are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA administers requirements covering the design, development, testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, and postmarket surveillance of medical devices. Medical devices are classified as Class I (lowest risk), II (moderate risk), or III (highest risk). Unless an exemption applies or the product is a Class I device, each medical device that we market must first receive either premarket notification clearance (by filing a 510(k) submission) or premarket approval (by filing a PMA) from the FDA. Breast implants are currently classified as Class III devices requiring an approved PMA for commercial distribution. In addition, certain modifications made to marketed devices also may require 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA supplement. 
The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval of a medical device can be lengthy and costly. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but it can take longer. The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy, and uncertain, and is generally preceded by the conduct of pre-clinical testing and a well-controlled clinical study. The FDA’s guidance document “Saline, Silicone Gel, and Alternative Breast Implants” currently recommends that a core study, which can be a single, open label, multi-center study, be conducted with ten years or more of prospective patient follow-up. To date, PMAs for silicone breast implants have been submitted for approval to the FDA with a minimum of three years of premarket core study data. Additionally, the FDA will not approve the PMA until it conducts a pre-approval inspection of our manufacturing facility and determines that it is in compliance with good manufacturing practices, as set forth in the FDA’s Quality System Regulation or QSR. The PMA review and approval process generally takes from one to three years but may take longer. The FDA’s guidance document “Saline, Silicone Gel, and Alternative Breast Implants” also states that manufacturers seeking approval of breast implants will be subject to post-approval requirements, which may include, but are not limited to, long-term follow-up of the core clinical study patients, conduct of separate post-approval studies, participation in a patient registry or other studies, and training programs for physicians and surgeons, and periodic reporting requirements. 
In addition to regulations governing 510(k) and PMA submissions, we are subject to regulations governing the conduct of clinical investigations, including regulations related to informed consent, Institutional Review Board review and approval, Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, and labeling of investigational devices. Our clinical study sites are subject to possible inspection by the FDA. We received an IDE approval from the FDA in March 2018, to initiate a clinical trial and our first patient was enrolled in April 2018.
When we initiate commercial distribution of our devices in the United States, we will be subject to FDA device listing and establishment registration, good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the QSR, labeling and promotion requirements, reporting of adverse events and device malfunctions, post-approval restrictions or conditions, post-market surveillance requirements, and reporting requirements for product recalls, or corrections or removals in the field. Our manufacturing facilities, as well as those of certain of our suppliers, will be subject to periodic and for-cause inspections by the FDA to verify compliance with the QSR and other regulatory requirements.
HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws 
We are subject to various laws governing the privacy and security of health information and other personally identifiable information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, established for the first time comprehensive U.S. federal protection for the privacy and security of protected health information. HIPAA standards apply to “Covered Entities,” which health plans, health care clearing houses, and certain health care providers which conduct certain health care transactions electronically, and to “Business Associates,” entities that perform services on behalf of a Covered Entity that involves the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of protected health information. Both Covered Entities and Business Associates must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of protected health information. Some of the institutions and physicians from which we obtain biological specimens that we use in our research and validation work are Covered Entities and must obtain proper authorization from their patients for the subsequent use of those samples and associated clinical information. We may perform future activities that may implicate HIPAA, such as providing clinical laboratory testing services or entering into specific kinds of relationships with a Covered Entity or a Business Associate of a Covered Entity. 
Additionally, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 amended HIPAA by increasing the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against Covered Entities, their Business Associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
Our activities must also comply with other applicable privacy laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. There are also additional national, state, and provincial privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of personal information, including data that is not protected health information, or are otherwise more stringent than HIPAA. All of these laws may impact our business. If we fail to comply with these privacy laws, or if significant changes in the laws restrict our ability to obtain tissue samples and associated patient information, this could significantly impact our business and our future business plans. 
Fraud and Abuse Laws 
Antifraud Laws/Overpayments
As participants in national and local health care programs, we may be subject to anti-fraud and abuse laws in various countries. Many of these anti-fraud laws are broad in scope and impose significant penalties for violation. Prohibitions under some of these laws include: 
▪the submission of false claims or false information to government programs; 
▪deceptive or fraudulent conduct; 
▪excessive or unnecessary services, services that do not meet medical necessity, or services at excessive prices; and
▪prohibitions in defrauding private sector health insurers.
Numerous national and local agencies enforce the antifraud and abuse laws. In addition, private insurers may also bring private actions. In some circumstances, private whistleblowers are authorized to bring fraud suits on behalf of the government against providers and are entitled to receive a portion of any final recovery. In addition, we, and our partners, may be subject to foreign laws and regulations and other compliance requirements, including, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other fraud and abuse laws.
Transparency Laws
We are subject to transparency requirements (also known as “sunshine laws”) in France, including obligations to report payments or transfers of value to, and the nature of the agreements we sign with, a broad class of French healthcare professionals and organizations. If our products are approved in the United States and become eligible for federal government reimbursement, we will also become subject to the Physician Payment Sunshine Act and its amendments and implementing regulations, which require annual reporting of payments and transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals and other “covered recipients”, along with physician ownership information. Various states have also implemented regulations prohibiting certain financial interactions with health care professionals or mandating public disclosure of such financial interactions. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, additional reporting and 
government oversight, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. As we expand the geographic market for our products, we may be subject to similar national or local laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to health care professionals. To reduce the risks associated with these various laws and governmental regulations, we have implemented a compliance plan. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable global privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly. 
International Medical Device Regulations 
International marketing of medical devices is subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. 
As of May 2021, medical device products that are marketed in the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation, or the MDR. The MDR will essentially operate in the same way as the Medical Device Directive (described below) to ensure a harmonized approach in the European Union to ensuring the safety and performance of medical devices, and failure to comply with the MDR could affect our ability to market and sell our products in the European Union member states. The European Commission is the legislative body responsible for directives, including Regulation (EU) 2017/745 which, once implemented in each member state, must be complied with by manufacturers selling medical products in the EU and the European Economic Area, or EEA. The EU includes most of the major countries in Europe, while other countries, such as Norway, are part of the EEA and European Free Trade Area, or EFTA, respectively, and have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the EU with respect to medical devices. The EU directives address regulation of the design, manufacture, labeling, clinical studies and post-market vigilance for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the General Safety and Performance Requirements, or GSPRs, and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the EU and EEA. 
Prior to May 2021, medical device products that were marketed in the European Union were required to comply with the requirements of Medical Device Directive, or the MDD, as implemented in the national legislation of the European Union member states. The MDD, as implemented, provided for a regulatory regime with respect to the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the European Union are safe and effective for their intended uses. Medical devices that complied with the MDD, as implemented, are entitled to bear a Conformité Européenne, or CE, marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the European Union. Failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect our ability to market and sell our products in these countries.
Outside of the EU, regulatory pathways for the marketing of medical devices vary greatly from country to country. In many countries, local regulatory agencies conduct an independent review of medical devices prior to granting marketing approval. For example, in China, approval by the National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, must be obtained prior to marketing a medical device. In Brazil, the inspections and approvals of products and facilities carried out by the ANVISA and InMetro agencies are required prior to marketing a Class 3a medical device like our Motiva Implants. We received regulatory clearance in Brazil in March 2017 and launched our Motiva Implants commercially in July 2017. The process in such countries may be lengthy and require the expenditure of significant resources, including the conduct of clinical trials. In other countries, the regulatory pathway may be shorter or less costly. The timeline for the introduction of new medical devices is heavily impacted by these various regulations on a country-by-country basis, which may become longer and more costly over time. 
Anti-Corruption Laws 
We are subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-corruption laws in the countries in which we distribute our products. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or U.S.-controlled business from paying, offering or 
authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.
Environment
Our manufacturing processes currently require the controlled use of potentially harmful chemicals, including highly flammable solvents and we are subject to inspections and other regulatory requirements, including Costa Rican regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations. For more information, please refer to Section 1A “Risk Factors”.
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 746 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements except for employees in Brazil. 
The human capital measures and objectives we focus on in managing our business include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of share-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management and technical personnel. Talent management is critical to our ability to execute on our long-term growth strategy. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make our company a safe and rewarding workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation and benefits, and by programs that build connections among our employees. We continue to be committed to an inclusive culture which values equity, opportunity, and respect. In support of our inclusive culture, we offer competitive compensation and benefits, including stock awards and strive to recruit a diverse talent pool across all levels of the organization.
