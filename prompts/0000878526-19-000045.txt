Neuro
Our Neuro business unit represents a comprehensive line of neurodiagnostic, neurocritical care, and neurosurgical products that are used by healthcare practitioners in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system. The environments in which these products are used include outpatient private practice facilities and inpatient hospital environments, including diagnostic procedures and monitoring of patients during admissions, surgery, while under sedation, in post-operative care, and in intensive care units. Our Neuro products and services include:
Neurodiagnostic
Electroencephalography—Equipment, supplies and services used to monitor and visually display the electrical activity generated by the brain and other key physiological signals for both diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders in the hospital, research laboratory, clinician office and patient’s home.

• | Electromyography—Equipment and supplies used to measure electrical activity in nerves, muscles, and critical pathways includes EMG, nerve conduction and evoked potential functionality.


• | Polysomnography—Equipment and supplies used to measure a variety of respiratory and physiologic functions to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of sleep disorders, such as insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that causes a person to stop breathing intermittently during sleep.


• | Intraoperative monitoring—Equipment and supplies used to monitor the functional integrity of certain neural structures (i.e. nerves, spinal cord and parts of the brain) during surgery. The goal of IOM is to provide real time guidance to the surgeon and anesthesiologist which will reduce the risk to the patient during surgery.

Neurocritical Care

• | Intracranial pressure monitoring—Equipment and catheters used to monitor pressure in the cranium/brain and catheters to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to aid in hydrocephalus and traumatic brain injury cases.

Neurosurgery

• | Shunts and Dural grafts—Shunts are used to manage the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to maintain appropriate levels of CSF when treating hydrocephalus. Dural grafts are used in procedures to repair or substitute a patient's dura mater in the brain.

Diagnostic EEG and Long-term Monitoring
We design, manufacture, and market a full line of instruments and supplies used to help diagnose the presence of seizure disorders and epilepsy, look for causes of confusion, evaluate head injuries, tumors, infections, degenerative diseases, and metabolic disturbances that affect the brain, and assist in surgical planning. This type of testing is also done to diagnose brain death in comatose patients. These systems and instruments work by detecting, amplifying, and recording the brain’s electrical impulses, as well as other physiological signals needed to support clinical findings. Routine clinical EEG recording is done by placing electrodes on a patient’s scalp over various areas of the brain to record and detect patterns of activity and specific types of electrical events. EEG technologists perform the tests, and neurologists, neurophysiologists and epileptologists review and interpret the results.
Routine outpatient clinical EEG testing is performed in hospital neurology laboratories, private physician offices, and in ambulatory settings such as the patient’s home, providing physicians with a clinical assessment of a patient’s condition. Long-term inpatient monitoring of EEG and behavior (LTM) is used to determine complex treatment plans, and for patients with seizures that do not respond to conventional therapeutic approaches, surgical solutions may be appropriate. Patients suffering from severe head trauma and other acute conditions that may affect the brain are monitored in ICUs. In addition, research facilities use EEG equipment to conduct research on humans and laboratory animals.
Global Neuro-Diagnostic Services (“GND”), which we acquired in early 2015, has historically provided in-home ambulatory EEG monitoring. In January 2019, as part of the implementation of our new “One Natus” organizational structure and our enhanced focus on our more profitable medical device businesses, we announced our plans to wind down GND operations during the first quarter of 2019.
Diagnostic Electroencephalograph Monitoring Product Lines
Our EEG diagnostic monitoring product lines for neurology consist of signal amplifiers, workstations to capture and store synchronized video and EEG data, and proprietary software. These products are typically used in concert, as part of an EEG “system” by the neurology/neurophysiology department of a hospital or clinic to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological conditions.

• | Supplies. We also manufacture and market a full line of proprietary EEG electrodes and other supplies used in the electroencephalography field. 

Electrodiagnostic Monitoring
Our electrodiagnostic systems include EMG, nerve conduction (“NCS”), and often evoked potential (“EP”) functionality. EMG and NCS involve the measurement of electrical activity of muscles and nerves both at rest and during contraction. Measuring the electrical activity in muscles and nerves can help diagnose diseases of the peripheral, central nervous system or musculature system. An electromyogram is done to determine if there is any disease present that effects muscle tissue, nerves, or the junctions between nerve and muscle (neuromuscular junctions). An electromyogram can also be used to diagnose the cause of weakness, paralysis, and muscle twitching, and is also used as a primary diagnosis for carpal tunnel syndrome, which is the most frequently encountered peripheral compressive neuropathy. EMG is also used for clinical applications of botox to relieve muscle spasm and pain. We market both the clinical system and the needles used for these procedures.
In addition to EMG and NCS functionality, many of our Electrodiagnostic systems also include EP. Evoked potentials are elicited in response to a stimulus. These evoked potentials can come from the sensory pathways (such as hearing and visual) or from the motor pathways. An examination tests the integrity of these pathways including the associated area of the brain. Sophisticated amplifiers are required to recognize and average evoked potential EMG and NCS signals.

Diagnostic Polysomnography Monitoring
3

PSG, which involves the analysis of respiratory patterns, brain electrical activity and other physiological data, has proven critical for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-related diseases such as apnea, insomnia, and narcolepsy. A full polysomnographic sleep study entails a whole-night recording of brain electrical activity, muscle movement, airflow, respiratory effort, oxygen levels, electrical activity of the heart, and other parameters. In some studies patients are fitted with treatment devices using Positive Airway Pressure technology (“PAP”) during the sleep study and the proper settings for the treatment devices are determined. In many cases, the sleep study is performed in the patient’s home.
Diagnostic PSG Monitoring Product Lines
We market dedicated diagnostic PSG monitoring products that can be used individually or as part of a networked system for overnight sleep studies to assist in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Additionally we offer products that are specifically designed to be used in the patient’s home. Some of our EEG systems described above can also be configured to perform diagnostic PSG monitoring.

4


• | Camino Catheters. Camino catheters use either fiber optic or strain gauge technology to measure either pressure and temperature or just pressure. Camino catheters measure their respective values at the tip of the catheter which eliminates the need for a fluid-filled system that uses an external transducer to measure pressure. The Camino Flex Ventricular Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Kit has a catheter that allows both the measurement of ICP and CSF drainage.

Neurosurgical Products
During brain surgery, the dura of the brain may need to be repaired or replaced. A dural graft is used to serve as a dural substitute for the surgical repair of dural defects. Moreover, brain surgery is performed to place shunts in the brain to help drain excess CSF either externally or into the body for reabsorption to help treat hydrocephalus.

Newborn Hearing Screening
Hearing impairment is the most common treatable chronic disorder in newborns, affecting as many as five babies out of every 1,000 newborns. It is estimated that 20,000 hearing-impaired babies are born in the United States (“U.S.”) every year, and as many as 60,000 more in the rest of the developed world. Until the introduction of universal newborn hearing screening programs, screening was generally performed only on those newborns that had identifiable risk factors for hearing impairment. However, screening only those newborns with risk factors for hearing impairment overlooks approximately half of newborns with some level of hearing impairment.
Early identification of hearing impairment and early intervention has been shown to improve language development significantly. Undetected hearing impairment often results in the failure to learn, process spoken language, and speak.
Newborn Hearing Screening Techniques
The two traditional technologies used to screen newborns and infants for hearing impairment are auditory brainstem response and otoacoustic emissions.
5

Auditory brainstem response (“ABR”).    ABR technology is the most accurate and comprehensive method for screening and diagnosing hearing impairment. ABR technology is based on detecting the brain’s electric impulses resulting from a specific auditory stimulus. 
Otoacoustic emission (“OAE”).    OAEs are sounds created by the active biomechanical processes within the sensory cells of the cochlea. They occur both spontaneously and in response to acoustic stimuli. OAE screening uses a probe placed in the ear canal to deliver auditory stimuli and to measure the response of the sensory cells with a sensitive microphone.
Newborn Hearing Screening Product Lines
Our newborn hearing screening product lines consist of the ALGO, ABaer, AuDX, and Echo-Screen newborn hearing screeners. These hearing screening products utilize proprietary signal detection technologies to provide accurate and non-invasive hearing screening for newborns and are designed to detect hearing loss at 30 or 35 dB nHL or higher. Each of these devices is designed to generate a PASS or REFER result.

• | ALGO 5 and 3i Newborn Hearing Screeners. These AABR devices deliver thousands of soft audible clicks to the newborn’s ears through sound cables and disposable earphones connected to the instrument. Each click elicits an identifiable brain wave, which is detected by disposable electrodes placed on the head of the child and analyzed by the screening device. These devices use our proprietary AABR signal detection algorithm. 


• | ABaer Newborn Hearing Screener. The ABaer, which is a PC-based newborn hearing screening device, offers a combination of AABR, OAE, and diagnostic ABR technologies in one system. 


• | Echo-Screen. Our hand-held Echo-Screen products provide a choice or combination of proprietary ABR and OAE technologies that can also be used for children through adults. The Echo-Screen III device is a compact, multi-modality handheld hearing screener that is tightly integrated with audible Lite Hearing Screening Data Management. 

Hearing Screening Supply Products

Our NatalCare incubators, including those used for transporting infants, provide high thermal performance with a double wall design, easy to use control panels and features such as improved weighing functionality with automatic centering and an electronic tilting mechanism. The easy-to-clean, smooth design, and choice of options make these customizable incubators appropriate for different use environments. 

Jaundice Management
The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that each year 60% of the approximately four million newborns in the U.S. become jaundiced. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, neonatal jaundice is the single largest cause for hospital readmission of newborns in the U.S., and accounts for 50% of readmissions. Because of the serious consequences of hyperbilirubinemia, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all newborns be closely monitored for jaundice and that phototherapy is the standard of care for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. The guidelines further recommend that all nurseries 
6

have the necessary equipment to provide intensive phototherapy, and specifically recommend the use of the “blue” light as incorporated into our neoBLUE products.
Jaundice Management Products

• | neoBLUE Product Family. This product line consists of our neoBLUE, neoBLUE Mini, neoBLUE Cozy, neoBLUE Compact and neoBLUE blanket devices, which utilize light emitting diodes (“LEDs”) to generate a high-intensity, narrow spectrum of blue light that is clinically proven to be most effective in the treatment of newborn jaundice. Our neoBLUE phototherapy devices emit significantly less ultraviolet light and heat than conventional phototherapy devices, reducing the risk of skin damage and dehydration for infants undergoing treatment. Because of the high intensity of these lights, the treatment time associated with phototherapy is reduced. 


• | Medix MediLED Product Family. A full-size, free-standing LED phototherapy system and a MediLED mini light to be used on top of an incubator or attached to the Medix radiant warmer. The MediLED incorporates an array of blue and white LEDs, while the mini system utilizes blue “super LEDs” that provide high intensity phototherapy. 

Newborn Brain Injury
For many years, newborn infants admitted to the NICU of a hospital have been routinely monitored for heart activity, temperature, respiration, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Recently it has also been considered important to monitor brain activity. A cerebral function monitor, utilizing amplitude-integrated EEGs (“aEEGs”), is a device for monitoring background neurological activity. Our simplified aEEG devices introduced over ten years ago, allow neonatologists and nurses to set-up and interpret basic neurological traces without neurology oversight.
Newborn Brain Injury Products
Our newborn brain injury products record and display parameters that the neonatologist uses to assess and monitor neurological status in the newborn. These devices continuously monitor and record brain activity, aiding in the detection and treatment of HIE and seizures. The devices also monitor the effects of drugs and other therapies on brain activity and improve the accuracy of newborn neurological assessments. They are used with electrodes attached to the head of the newborn to acquire an EEG signal that is then filtered, compressed, and displayed graphically on the device or as a hardcopy printout. The monitors have touch screens for easy navigation and onscreen keyboards for data entry at the bedside.

• | Olympic Brainz Monitor. The Olympic Brainz Monitor is our latest generation Cerebral Function Monitor. The device can be used in single-channel, two-channel or three-channel modes to continuously monitor and record brain activity.

Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

We also look at revenue as either being generated from sales of Devices and Systems, which are generally non-recurring, or related Supplies and Services, which are generally recurring. The products that are attributable to these categories are described above. Revenue from Devices and Systems, Supplies and Services as a percent of total revenue for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Devices and Systems | 72 | % | | 71 | % | 63 | %
Supplies | 22 | % | | 22 | % | 28 | %
Services | 6 | % | | 7 | % | 9 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

In 2018, 2017 and 2016, no single end-user customer comprised more than 10% of our revenue.
Backlog
In general, the company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, the company believes that backlog information is not meaningful to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Marketing and Sales
9

Marketing
Our marketing strategy differentiates our products by their level of quality, performance, and customer benefit. We educate customers worldwide about our products through trade conferences and direct presentations to healthcare professionals.
Domestic Direct and Distributor Sales
We sell our products in North America primarily through a direct sales organization. We believe this direct sales organization allows us to maintain a higher level of customer service and satisfaction than would otherwise be possible by other distribution methods. We also sell certain products under private label and distribution arrangements.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, domestic revenue as a percent of total revenue was approximately as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Domestic revenue | 56.7 | % | | 54.1 | % | 65.6 | %

International Direct and Distributor Sales
We sell some of our products outside the U.S. through direct sales channels in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nordics (Finland, Sweden, Norway) Spain, United Kingdom and parts of Latin America; we sell other products in those regions and into more than 100 other countries through a distributor sales channel.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, international revenue as a percent of total revenue was approximately as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
International revenue | 43.3 | % | | 45.9 | % | 34.4 | %

We sell products to our distributors under substantially the same terms as sales through our direct sales channels. Terms of sales to international distributors are generally “ex works,” where title and risk of loss are assumed by the distributor at the shipping point. Distributors are generally given exclusive rights in their territories to purchase products from Natus and to resell to end users or sub-distributors. Our distributors typically perform marketing, sales, and technical support functions in their respective markets. Each distributor may sell Natus products to their customer directly, via other distributors or resellers, or both. We actively train our distributors in product marketing, selling, and technical service techniques.
Seasonality in Revenue
We experience seasonality in our revenue. Demand for our products is historically higher in the second half of the year compared to the first. Our seasonality results from the purchasing habits of our hospital-based customers, whose purchases are often governed by calendar year budgets.
Group Purchasing Organizations
More than 90% of the hospitals in the U.S. are members of group purchasing organizations (“GPO”s), which negotiate volume purchase agreements for member hospitals, group practices, and other clinics.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, revenue from direct purchases by GPO members as a percent of total revenue was approximately as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Direct purchases by GPO members | 13.3 | % | | 14.5 | % | 12.3 | %

Third-Party Reimbursement
In the U.S., healthcare providers generally rely on third-party payors, including private health insurance plans, federal Medicare, state Medicaid, and managed care organizations, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedures they perform. Third-party payors can affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement these payors provide for services utilizing our products. In addition, our Peloton hearing screening service is dependent on third-party payors to reimburse us for services provided.
10

Customer Service and Support
We generally provide a one-year warranty on our medical device and system products. We also sell extended service agreements on our medical device and system products. Service, repair, and calibration services for our domestic customers are provided by Company-owned service centers and our field service specialists. Service for international customers is provided by a combination of Company-owned facilities and vendors on a contract basis.
Manufacturing
Other companies manufacture a significant portion of the components used in our products; however, we perform final assembly, testing, and packaging of many of the devices ourselves to control quality and manufacturing efficiency. We also use contract vendors to manufacture some of our disposable supply and medical device products. We perform regular quality assessments of these vendors, which include on-site quality audits.
We purchase materials and components from qualified suppliers that are subject to our quality specifications and inspections. We conduct quality audits of our key suppliers, several of which are experienced in the supply of components to manufacturers of finished medical devices, or supplies for use with medical devices. Most of our purchased components are available from more than one supplier.
Our manufacturing, service, and repair facilities are subject to periodic inspection by local and foreign regulatory authorities. Our quality assurance system is subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other government agencies. We are required to conduct our product design, testing, manufacturing, and control activities in conformance with the FDA’s quality system regulations and to maintain our documentation of these activities in a prescribed manner. In addition, our production facilities have received International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13485 certification. ISO 13485 certification standards for quality operations have been developed to ensure that medical device companies meet the standards of quality on a worldwide basis. We have also received the EC Certificate pursuant to the European Union Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, which allows us to place a CE mark on our products.
Research and Development
We are committed to introducing new products and supporting current product offerings in our markets through a combination of internal as well as external efforts that are consistent with our corporate strategy.
Internal product development capabilities.    We believe that product development capabilities are essential to provide our customers with new product offerings. We plan to leverage our core technologies by introducing product line extensions as well as new product offerings. 
Partnerships that complement our expertise.    We continue to seek strategic partners in order to develop products that may not otherwise be available to us. By taking advantage of our core competencies, we believe that we can bring products to market in an efficient manner and leverage our distribution channels. 
New opportunities through technology acquisition.    We continue to evaluate new, emerging, and complementary technologies in order to identify new product opportunities. With our knowledge of our current markets we believe that we can effectively develop technologies into successful new products. 
Our research and development expenses were $61.7 million or 11.6% of total revenue in 2018, $51.8 million or 10.3% of total revenue in 2017, and $33.4 million or 8.8% of total revenue in 2016.
Proprietary Rights
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by filing patent applications for new features and products we develop. We enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, and corporate partners, and seek to control access to our intellectual property, distribution channels, documentation, and other proprietary information. However, we believe that these measures afford only limited protection.
The intellectual rights to some of the original patents for technology incorporated into our products are now in the public domain. However, we do not consider these patents, or any currently viable patent or related group of patents, to be of such importance that their expiration or termination would materially affect our business.
We capitalize the cost of purchased technology and intellectual property, as well as certain costs incurred in obtaining patent rights, and amortize these costs over the estimated economic lives of the related assets.
We have several registered trademarks and service marks. Our marks are pending or registered trademarks in the United States and several foreign countries. We intend to file for additional trademarks to strengthen our trademark rights, but we cannot be certain that our trademark applications will result in registration or that our trademarks will be enforceable.
11

Competition
We sell our products in competitive and rapidly evolving markets. We face competition from other companies in all of our product lines. Our competitors range from small privately-held companies to multinational corporations and their product offerings vary in scope and breadth. We do not believe that any single competitor is dominant in any of our product lines.
We derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our medical devices. In the U.S., we sell our supply products in a mature market and we expect that our products could face increasing competition, including competitors offering lower prices, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profit margins.
Integra LifeSciences continues to offer products and services that compete with the neurosurgery product lines we acquired in the Integra Asset Acquisition, and we expect significant competition from Integra LifeSciences as we seek to maintain and expand this business. 
We believe the principal factors that will draw clinicians and other buyers to our products, include:

• | Level of specificity, sensitivity, and reliability of the product;


• | Time required to obtain results with the product, such as to test for or treat a clinical condition;


• | Relative ease of use of the product;


• | Depth and breadth of the products features;


• | Quality of customer support for the product;


• | Frequency of product updates;


• | Extent of third-party reimbursement of the cost of the product or procedure;


• | Extent to which the products conform to standard of care guidelines; and


• | Price of the product.

We believe that our primary competitive strength relates to the functionality and reliability of our products. Different competitors may have competitive advantages in one or more of the categories listed above and they may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products.
Government Regulation
FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, the medical devices we sell in the United States, must first receive one of the following types of FDA premarket review authorizations under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, as amended:

• | Clearance via Section 510(k); or


• | Premarket approval via Section 515 if the FDA has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury.

The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to six months, but can take longer. The process of obtaining premarket approval via Section 515 is much more costly, lengthy, and uncertain. Premarket approval generally takes from one to three years, but can take longer. We cannot be sure that the FDA will ever grant either 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market in the United States.
The FDA decides whether a device must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or premarket approval process based upon statutory criteria. These criteria include the level of risk that the FDA perceives to be associated with the device and a determination of whether the product is a type of device that is substantially equivalent to devices that are already legally marketed. The FDA places devices deemed to pose relatively less risk in either Class I or Class II, which requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification requesting 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies. The premarket notification under Section 510(k) must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications.
The FDA places devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, in its Class III classification. The FDA requires these devices to undergo the premarket approval process via Section 515 in which the manufacturer must prove the safety and effectiveness of the device. A premarket approval application must provide extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data.
12

The FDA may require results of clinical trials in support of a 510(k) submission and generally requires clinical trial results for a premarket approval application. In order to conduct a clinical trial on a significant-risk device, the FDA requires manufacturers to apply for and obtain, in advance, an investigational-device exemption. The investigational-device exemption application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. If the FDA and the Institutional Review Boards at the clinical trial sites approve the investigational-device exemption application for a significant-risk device, the manufacturer may begin the clinical trial. An investigational-device exemption approval provides for a specified clinical protocol, including the number of patients and study sites. If the manufacturer deems the product a non-significant risk device, the product will be eligible for more abbreviated investigational-device exemption requirements. If the Institutional Review Boards at the clinical trial sites concur with the non-significant risk determination, the manufacturer may begin the clinical trial.
Most of our products have been cleared by the FDA as Class II devices.
FDA Regulation
Numerous FDA regulatory requirements apply to our products. These requirements include:

• | FDA quality system regulations which require manufacturers to create, implement, and follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures;


• | Medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA certain types of adverse and other events involving their products; and


• | FDA general prohibitions against promoting products for unapproved uses.

Class II and III devices may also be subject to special controls applied to them, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidelines that may not apply to Class I devices. We believe we are in compliance with applicable FDA guidelines, but we could be required to change our compliance activities or be subject to other special controls if the FDA changes existing regulations or adopts new requirements.
We are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to adequately comply, the FDA can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, including:

• | Issuance of a Form 483 citation;


• | Fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;


• | Recall or seizure of our products;


• | Issuance of public notices or warnings;


• | Imposition of operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;


• | Refusal of our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products;


• | Withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval already granted; or


• | Criminal prosecution.

The FDA also has the authority to require us to repair or replace any misbranded or adulterated medical device manufactured or distributed by us.
Other Regulations
We also must comply with numerous additional federal, state, and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, biohazards, fire hazard control, and hazardous substance disposal. We believe we are currently in compliance with such regulations.
Countries outside of the U.S. regulate medical devices in a manner similar to that of the FDA. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to audit and have been certified to be ISO 13485:2016, Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, and MDSAP compliant, which allows us to sell our products in Canada, Europe, and other territories around the world. All of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by our notified bodies or other competent authorities, and in some cases without advance notice. We plan to seek approval to sell our products in additional countries, while maintaining our current approvals. The time and cost of obtaining new, and maintaining existing, market authorizations from countries outside of North America, and the requirements for licensing products in these countries may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
In 2017, the European Union ("EU")adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (Council Regulations 2017/745) which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including new quality system and post-market surveillance requirements. The regulation has a three-year implementation period to May 2020 and will replace the existing directives on medical devices in the EU. After May 2020, medical devices marketed in the EU will require certification according 
13

to these new requirements, except that devices with valid CE certificates, issued pursuant to the Medical Device Directive before May 2020, may be placed on the market until 2024. Complying with this new regulation will require us to incur significant costs and failure to meet the requirements of the regulation could adversely impact our business in the European Union and other countries that utilize or rely on European Union requirements for medical device registrations.
Employees
On December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,729 full time employees worldwide. In Argentina, some of our production employees are represented by labor unions and our employees in Germany have established a works council. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
