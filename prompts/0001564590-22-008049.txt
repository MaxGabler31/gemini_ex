ITEM 1.  Business
   
Avidity Biosciences (also referred to as Avidity, we, our or us) is a biopharmaceutical company committed to delivering a new class of RNA therapeutics called Antibody Oligonucleotide Conjugates, or AOCs. Our proprietary AOC platform is designed to combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, with the precision of RNA therapeutics to target the root cause of diseases previously untreatable 
 1
 
with such therapeutics. We are initially focused on muscle diseases to demonstrate the capabilities of our AOCs, and we expect to have three muscle programs in clinical development by the end of 2022. Our lead product candidate, AOC 1001, is designed to treat myotonic dystrophy type 1, or DM1, a rare monogenic muscle disease. In October 2021, we dosed the first patient in our Phase 1/2 MARINA clinical trial, a trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of AOC 1001 administered intravenously in adults with DM1. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we plan to conduct a preliminary assessment of safety, tolerability and key biomarkers in approximately half of the trial participants. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have granted Orphan Designation for AOC 1001. The FDA has also granted Fast Track Designation to AOC 1001 for the treatment of DM1.  
 Our advancing and expanding pipeline also includes AOC 1044, the lead of three programs for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD, and AOC 1020, designed to treat facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD. We anticipate that both AOC 1044 and AOC 1020 will enter the clinic by the end of 2022 following additional preparatory preclinical studies and regulatory clearance. In addition to our muscle franchise, we are also broadening the development of AOCs beyond muscle tissues through both internal discovery efforts and key partnerships that are focused on immune cells, cardiac tissue and other cell types.
 Our Strategy
 
Our vision is to profoundly improve people’s lives by revolutionizing the delivery of RNA therapeutics. We are executing on that vision by focusing on our three strategic pillars: a disruptive and broad AOC platform, an advancing and expanding pipeline and building an agile and diverse company. With this strategy, our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize novel AOC therapeutics that overcome current barriers to the delivery of oligonucleotides and unlock their potential to treat a wide range of serious diseases currently lacking adequate treatment options. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:

• | Harness the power of our AOC platform to develop a new class of drugs. We are committed to delivering a new class of RNA therapeutics by utilizing decades of research on the power of oligonucleotides. Our deep experience with oligonucleotide therapeutics, modulation of RNA processes, antibody engineering and conjugation, and drug delivery techniques provide the foundation for our efforts to address the current limitations of oligonucleotide therapies. Our disruptive and broad AOC platform also affords us the option to deploy various types of oligonucleotides, including small interfering RNAs, or siRNAs, and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, or PMOs, whose specific mechanisms of action modify RNA function in different ways. This flexibility allows us to use oligonucleotides that are tailored to have the potential to modulate a given disease process. Potential mechanisms of action for these oligonucleotides can range from reducing the expression of disease-related RNA with siRNAs, to correction of aberrant processing of RNAs with splice modifying oligonucleotides. AOCs are designed to do the following:

o | Combine the proven technologies of approved mAbs and oligonucleotides
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Deliver to tissues previously untreatable with RNA therapeutics, starting with muscle and broadening to other tissues and cell types
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Scale with experienced manufacturers who are able to utilize well-established and scalable methods for manufacturing mAbs and oligonucleotides. We also have the ability to use a single mAb across multiple programs, providing significant leverage around development costs and timelines associated with each incremental muscle program.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue Advancing and Expanding Our Pipeline. We are advancing and expanding our innovative AOC pipeline to offer treatment options for people across a wide-range of therapeutic areas. Our first AOC programs are from our muscle disease franchise. We are also broadening the reach of AOCs beyond muscle tissues through both internal discovery efforts and key partnerships. We are progressing our pipeline in the following ways:

o | Advancing our lead product candidate, AOC 1001, through clinical trials to approval. AOC 1001 is designed to address the root cause of DM1 by reducing levels of a disease-related mRNA called dystrophy myotonic protein kinase, or DMPK. AOC 1001 consists of a proprietary mAb that binds to the transferrin receptor 1, or TfR1, receptor conjugated with a siRNA targeting DMPK mRNA. In October 2021, we dosed the first patient in our ongoing Phase 1/2 MARINA trial of AOC 1001 in adults with DM1. The FDA and EMA have granted Orphan Designation for AOC 1001 and the FDA has granted AOC 1001 Fast Track Designation for the treatment of DM1.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Progressing our FSHD and DMD programs into clinical development. We expect to initiate clinical trials for AOC 1044, targeting Exon 44 and the first of three DMD programs, and AOC 1020, our FSHD program, by the end of 2022 following additional preparatory preclinical studies and regulatory clearance. There are no therapies approved for mutations amenable to skipping Exon 44 and no therapies approved to treat FSHD.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Expanding our pipeline within and beyond muscle. Our expanding pipeline also includes two additional programs in DMD targeting Exons 51 and 45, as well as programs in muscle atrophy and Pompe disease. We continue to pursue additional programs that expand our AOC pipeline beyond muscle and into other indications including immune cells, cardiomyocytes and other cell types. Through internal discovery efforts and partnerships, our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize novel AOC therapeutics that overcome current barriers to the delivery of oligonucleotides and unlock their potential to treat a wide range of serious diseases currently lacking adequate treatment options.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build an agile and diverse company. We have assembled a management team with deep experience in the discovery, development and commercialization of RNA therapeutics. The team also has extensive knowledge of oligonucleotide therapeutics, modulation of RNA processes, antibody engineering and conjugation, and drug delivery techniques. Our team also has broad experience in the discovery, development and commercialization of products for rare diseases, including building clinical and commercial organizations that support the unique needs of the rare disease community.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As we grow the company, we plan to continue to employ a disciplined strategy to maximize the value of our pipeline by retaining development and commercialization rights to those product candidates, indications and geographies that we believe we can ultimately commercialize successfully on our own if they are approved. We plan to collaborate on product candidates that we believe have promising utility in disease areas or patient populations that are better served by the resources or specific expertise of other biopharmaceutical companies. For example, we are collaborating with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, initially on up to six mRNA targets in immunology and other select indications outside of muscle for the delivery, development and commercialization of AOCs. We entered into a collaboration with MyoKardia that will help us expand our therapeutic activities to include cardiac-specific indications. Through additional collaborations and our internal research, we plan to continue to invest our resources in our AOC platform to explore the full potential of our AOCs in additional previously inaccessible tissue and cell types.
 Our AOC Product Platform
 
Overview
 
We are committed to delivering a new class of RNA therapeutics called AOCs designed to overcome the current limitations of oligonucleotide therapies in order to treat a wide range of serious diseases. We utilize our proprietary AOC platform to design, engineer and develop therapeutics that combine specificity of mAbs with the precision of oligonucleotide therapies to target the root cause of diseases previously untreatable with such therapeutics. All of our oligonucleotides target disease-related RNA. RNA is a polymeric molecule essential in the coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes. We have accumulated deep experience regarding oligonucleotide therapeutics, modulation of RNA processes, antibody engineering and conjugation, and drug delivery techniques. We collectively refer to the know-how 
 3
 
and proprietary technology born out of this experience, and their systematic application in the design and development of our product candidates, as our AOC platform. 
 
Our Approach
 
Based on the data-driven hypothesis that the delivery of oligonucleotides can be greatly enhanced by using antibodies as conjugates, our scientists have established a framework for screening potential cell surface protein-mAb pairs to determine which pairs we believe are well suited to deliver active oligonucleotides to specific cell types. We have identified multiple cell surface protein-mAb pairs that can deliver oligonucleotides into various tissue and cell types to induce pharmacologic changes. For example, we have employed AOCs built on a scaffold of a mAb or mAb fragment that binds with high selectivity and affinity to TfR1 to deliver oligonucleotides to cell types outside of the liver, in particular to muscle.
 Our AOC platform also affords us the option to deploy various types of oligonucleotides, including siRNAs and PMOs, whose specific mechanisms of action modify RNA function in different ways. This flexibility allows us to use oligonucleotides that are tailored to modulate a given disease process. Mechanisms of these oligonucleotides can range from reducing the expression of a disease-related RNA with siRNAs, to correction of aberrant processing of RNAs with splice modifying oligonucleotides.
 In preclinical studies, our AOCs have demonstrated pharmacologic responses as measured by mRNA reduction in liver, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, activated B- and T-cells and lymphocyte subsets, as well as macrophages.
 Our AOC Platform Proprietary Chemistry
 
Successfully engineering an active AOC requires a sophisticated understanding of the precise characteristics of each of the components of the AOC, as well as their behavior when acting in concert. We have deployed significant know-how towards optimizing our AOCs, beginning with their individual oligonucleotide and mAb components.
 
Optimization of the oligonucleotide. We have engineered our oligonucleotides to maximize their stability, potency and specificity. For many of our applications, the oligonucleotide we employ is a double-stranded siRNA, comprised of a passenger and guide strand. Modifications to the passenger strand are designed to reduce loading into the RNA Induced Silencing Complex, or RISC, decreasing inadvertent RNA interference activity from the passenger strand. In comparison, modifications to the guide strand, also known as the active strand, are designed to enhance RISC loading, increasing the potential for matching sequences in newly transcribed RNA. Following a match, enzymes in the RISC will cleave the targeted mRNA, thereby effectively destroying it and reducing disease-related RNA levels. Our siRNAs have been stabilized to withstand the nucleases in lysosomes, enhancing their ability to escape the lysosome after AOC internalization and antibody degradation.
 In preclinical studies, we observed that AOCs in circulation were stable for at least seven days. The biologic activity of the AOC was independent of plasma circulation times because the AOCs were cleared from plasma more rapidly than tissues. Once delivered into cells, our oligonucleotide therapeutics were stabilized and, particularly when loaded into the RISC, had prolonged activity. In mice treated with our AOC, the half-life of siRNA in muscle tissue was approximately 12 days. In comparison, the half-life of siRNA in RISC had a projected half-life of approximately 80 days, suggesting that, once in tissues, the siRNA is stabilized in RISC, prolonging the duration of action.
 We believe that chemical modifications to the siRNA drive their long-lived pharmacologic activity. We observed that a single dose of 3 mg/kg of a siRNA in an AOC administered to monkeys reduced the level of the mRNA for DMPK for eight months. We believe that these results suggest that AOCs for muscle diseases may be given as infrequent intravenous doses similar to those that are being used with other siRNA therapeutics in the liver.

Optimization of the mAb. Prior to choosing mAbs, we tried a number of delivery moieties including small molecule ligands, peptide fragments and antigen-binding fragments, or Fabs. For example, we conducted a study on plasma pharmacokinetics in nonhuman primates, where we compared a siRNA loaded onto a Fab fragment versus siRNA loaded onto a full-length mAb. The full-length mAb demonstrated superior pharmacokinetics. After conducting these preclinical experiments, we ultimately chose the proven technology of mAbs due to their well-established safety profiles, high specificity and affinity and more attractive plasma kinetics.
 Because the mAb is the key delivery agent for our oligonucleotides, we are focused on identifying and tailoring mAbs to enhance their selectivity and minimize toxicity. For example, all our muscle programs employ our proprietary, effector function null, fully humanized IgG1 mAb targeting human TfR1. This antibody was selected to minimize interference with transferrin binding, minimizing alterations of iron uptake by the targeted cells. Further, our antibody is selective to TfR1 and does not cross-react with TfR2, which is widely expressed in the liver. Selectivity of our anti-transferrin receptor antibody for human and cynomolgus monkey TfR1 can be attributed to our antibody binding domain, to an epitope that is conserved between human TfR1 and cynomolgus monkey TfR1. To minimize antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or ADCC, and complement fixation, we introduced mutations to eliminate effector functions. Reduction of ADCC has been shown for the lead clones. The final clone-expressing cell was selected based on high production yields and optimized physical and chemical properties. The selected mAb demonstrated good delivery into human skeletal muscle cells in vitro and favorable bioconjugation with a siRNA, and polyclonal versions of the mAb showed favorable delivery and pharmacodynamics in studies in cynomolgus monkeys.
 Optimization of the antibody conjugate design. In addition to the oligonucleotide and the mAb, we have also optimized the conjugation of the two, including the linker. Our linkers are optimized for stability and durability, as evidenced by preclinical studies in which we observed enhanced stability of some linkers over others. In addition to optimizing our linker, we optimize several other key aspects including sites of conjugation and the ratio of oligonucleotides to antibodies.
 
Advantages of our AOC Product Platform
 
We believe that the product candidates derived from our AOC platform will have the potential to offer the following distinct advantages:
 
 
● | Expand scope of diseases addressable with oligonucleotides: (i) utilize identified cell surface protein-antibody pairs to design oligonucleotides in order to target the root cause of diseases previously untreatable with RNA therapeutics; (ii) flexibility to deploy an appropriate oligonucleotide type for different diseases; and (iii) optimize all structural components of our AOCs for effective delivery—the oligonucleotide, the mAb and the antibody conjugate design. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potential to mitigate toxicity by limiting drug exposure: (i) selection of the most potent oligonucleotide type; (ii) targeted delivery to tissues and cells; and (iii) infrequent administration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Infrequent dosing: (i) ability to deliver oligonucleotides to tissues and cells at concentrations that produce pronounced and prolonged pharmacodynamic effects as observed in our preclinical models; and (ii) ability to select appropriate oligonucleotide mechanisms to maximize durability.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Readily reproducible and scalable: (i) AOCs synthesized using well-established and scalable methods for manufacturing mAbs and oligonucleotides; and (ii) ability to use a single mAb across multiple programs provides significant leverage around development costs and timelines associated with each incremental muscle program. For example, we use the same mAb targeting TfR1 across our current muscle franchise.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Development Programs
 
We are advancing and expanding our innovative AOC pipeline to develop potential treatment options for patients and their families across a wide-range of therapeutic areas. Our first AOC programs are from 
 5
 
our muscle disease franchise where we have leveraged our deep experience with oligonucleotide therapeutics, modulation of RNA processes, antibody engineering and conjugation and drug delivery techniques. The research and development chart below represents a summary of our wholly owned development programs, which are focused on muscle disease:




In addition to our wholly owned programs in muscle disease, we also have development efforts focused on immune and other cell types. Under the Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Lilly, or the Lilly Agreement, we are collaborating with Lilly for the discovery, development and commercialization of AOCs directed to up to six selected mRNA targets in immunology and other select indications outside of muscle. Through our research collaboration with Myokardia and our internal discovery efforts, we are expanding our development activities to include cardiac-specific indications.
 
Our Muscle Disease Franchise
 
We have selected muscle as the first tissue type in which to explore the potential of our AOCs. In our early screening efforts, we observed a 95% reduction of target gene expression in mouse skeletal muscle with the AOC we tested, which in part led us to focus on developing a deep pipeline of AOCs that are designed to address multiple muscle diseases including DM1, FSHD and DMD. We currently use the same proprietary mAb targeting TfR1 across our muscle programs, which we believe gives us significant leverage of development costs and timelines associated with each incremental muscle program.
Our Clinical Program
 
AOC 1001 for the Treatment of Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1)
 
Our lead product candidate utilizing the AOC platform, AOC 1001, is designed to address the root cause of DM1 by reducing levels of a disease-related mRNA called DMPK. AOC 1001 consists of a proprietary mAb that binds to TfR1 conjugated with a siRNA targeting DMPK mRNA. The FDA and EMA have granted Orphan Designation for AOC 1001. In October, the FDA also granted Fast Track Designation to AOC 1001 for the treatment of DM1. 
 

Phase 1/2 MARINA clinical trial
 In October 2021, we dosed the first patient in our Phase 1/2 MARINA clinical trial, a trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of AOC 1001 administered 
 6
 
intravenously in adults with DM1. The MARINA trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2 clinical trial expected to enroll approximately 44 adults with DM1. The MARINA trial is assessing the activity of AOC 1001 across key biomarkers, including spliceopathy, an important biomarker for DM1, and knockdown of DMPK mRNA. Though the Phase 1/2 trial is not powered to assess functional benefit, it is exploring the clinical activity of AOC 1001 including measures of mobility and muscle strength as well as patient reported outcomes and quality of life measures. Patients will have the option to enroll in an open label extension study at the end of the post-treatment period. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Avidity plans to conduct a preliminary assessment of safety, tolerability and key biomarkers in approximately half of the study participants. 
 

The sites participating in the MARINA trial are all part of the Myotonic Dystrophy Clinical Research Network, or DMCRN. The DMCRN is running a natural history study called Establishing Biomarkers and Clinical Endpoints in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1, or END-DM1. We have entered into a collaboration supporting END-DM1, a non-interventional study designed to advance the understanding of disease progression in approximately 700 people with DM1. With our collaboration, we are able to assess the data from END-DM1, which we believe will help to inform the clinical development of AOC 1001.
 
DM1 Disease Overview
 
DM1 is an underrecognized, progressive and often fatal neuromuscular disease with multiple organ involvement. DM1 is a monogenic, autosomal dominant disease caused by a triplet-repeat in the DMPK gene, resulting in a toxic gain of function mRNA. DM1 primarily affects skeletal and cardiac muscle and can be highly variable with respect to severity, presentation and age of onset. Patients can suffer from a constellation of manifestations including myotonia and muscle weakness, respiratory problems, fatigue, hypersomnia, cardiac abnormalities, gastrointestinal complications, and cognitive and behavioral impairment. DM1 is estimated to affect over 40,000 people in the United States and there are similar prevalence estimates for Europe. All forms, except the late-onset form, of DM1 are associated with high levels of disease burden and may cause premature mortality. 
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations
 
There are currently no approved therapies to treat DM1, and medical care is focused largely on symptom management. Due to the well-known challenges of delivery, a previous attempt at treating DM1 with an unconjugated antisense oligonucleotide was discontinued. Therefore, there remains a high unmet medical need for new disease modifying therapies.
Our Solution
 
7
 

AOC 1001 consists of a proprietary mAb that binds to TfR1 conjugated with a siRNA, siDMPK.19, targeted to DMPK RNA, and is designed to be administered to the patient as an intravenous infusion. We believe that the following specific characteristics of AOC 1001 position it to have advantages over historical and current efforts to develop an effective therapy for people with DM1:

• | Addresses the underlying cause of the disease—DM1 is caused by an increase in the number of CUG triplet repeats occurring in the DMPK gene product. AOC 1001 is designed to reduce the expression levels DMPK RNA, thereby reducing the CUG burden in the nucleus and thereby releasing muscle blind-like protein to allow for normal mRNA processing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficient delivery of drug substance to diseased cells—In an effort to solve for challenges identified in prior unsuccessful efforts to deliver an unconjugated oligonucleotide into muscle cells, the TfR1 antibody component of AOC 1001 facilitates efficient delivery of AOC 1001 to skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Once inside the muscle cells, the siRNA component of AOC 1001, siDMPK.19, acts to reduce levels of DMPK mRNA in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In preclinical studies in cynomolgus monkeys, we observed that treatment with an AOC containing siDMPK.19 produced a greater than 50% reduction of DMPK mRNA across a wide range of skeletal muscles at a concentration of 1 nM or less, approximately 1,000 fold more potent than has been reported for an unconjugated antisense oligonucleotide. We also observed reductions in DMPK mRNA in the gastrointestinal tract.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reproducible and scalable therapeutic—As with all our AOCs, AOC 1001 is readily synthesized using well-established and scalable methods for manufacturing mAbs and oligonucleotides.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Preclinical Data supporting AOC 1001
 In preclinical studies in mice and cynomolgus monkeys, AOC 1001 delivered siRNAs to muscle cells and reduce the levels of DMPK RNA across a broad range of muscles including skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. These data suggest that AOC 1001 has potential to be a potent and infrequently dosed therapy in DM1. In in vitro experiments in cells from patients with DM1, after treatment with siDMPK.19, we observed reductions in nuclear foci, and a return to more normal splicing patterns for key genes. 
 
In muscle cells derived from patients with DM1, we observed that it is possible to reduce the number of muscle blind-like protein, or MBNL, or MBNL, -associated nuclear foci after incubation with siDMPK.19. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed that incubation of DM1 patient cells with siDMPK.19 resulted in a release of the MBNL and quantifiable reductions in nuclear foci. In addition, we observed substantial improvements in disease-related biomarkers as measured by the splice score in the cells of patients with DM1following treatment with siDMPK.19. We used RNA-sequence analysis of the myotubes from patients with DM1 to create a splice score for control human subjects’ cells treated with siDMPK.19 or the inactive siRNA, siDMPK.29. When patient myotubes were analyzed, there was a marked improvement in the splice score of the myotubes treated with the siDMPK.19 compared to the inactive siDMPK.29. The splice signature approached that of control myotubes.
 
In cynomolgus monkeys, we observed that a single dose of 2 mg/kg of siDMPK.19 included in AOC 1001 produced an approximately 75% reduction of DMPK mRNA in skeletal muscles that was sustained up to 12 weeks after administration. We also observed that treatment with an AOC containing siDMPK.19 produced a greater than 50% reduction of DMPK mRNA across a wide range of skeletal muscles at a concentration of 1 nM or less and we also observed reductions in DMPK mRNA in the jejunum and ileum. Plasma profiles demonstrated no neutralizing antibodies to AOC 1001. In addition, AOC 1001 reduced muscle DMPK mRNA in a concentration responsive manner. We completed our IND-enabling good laboratory practice, or GLP, toxicology study of AOC 1001 in non-human primate. Results from the 13-week study showed that AOC 1001 was generally well tolerated and supported advancement into the clinic. The highest dose tested was the maximum feasible dose and was the no-observed adverse effect level, or NOAEL. We did not observe any treatment-related histopathologic toxicity or any changes in safety pharmacology parameters (cardiac, respiratory and neurological). All dose levels in the GLP toxicology study produced a greater than 80% reduction in the expression of DMPK across multiple skeletal muscles, suggesting that pharmacology was essentially saturated even at the lowest dose tested. These data taken together with the data from cells from DM1 patients demonstrate marked and prolonged reductions in levels of DMPK mRNA expression, nM potency, along with reductions in nuclear foci and a return to more 
 8
 
normal splicing patterns for key genes, suggesting that AOC 1001 has potential to be a potent, infrequently dosed therapy for people with DM1.
 
Our Pre-IND Programs:
 
AOC 1020 for the Treatment of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD)
 
We are developing AOC 1020 to treat the underlying cause of FSHD, one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy. Our therapeutic strategy in FSHD is to use an AOC based on our proprietary mAb that targets TfR1 to deliver a siRNA targeted to DUX4 mRNA. In preclinical models, we observed siRNA-mediated DUX4 silencing in muscle cells from patients with FSHD. Following regulatory clearance, we plan to advance AOC 1020 into a clinical trial by the end of 2022. Due to the lack of available therapies in this rare disease, should our trial be successful, we plan to explore the potential to advance this program into registrational trials in order to expedite making an AOC available for a patient population in severe need.
Disease Overview
 
FSHD is characterized by progressive and often asymmetric skeletal muscle loss that initially causes weakness in muscles in the face, shoulders, arms and trunk and progresses to weakness in muscles in lower body. FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease caused by the aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene in the skeletal muscle, which activates genes that are toxic to muscle cells and leads to a series of downstream events that result in skeletal muscle wasting and compromised muscle function. Skeletal muscle weakness results in physical limitations throughout the whole body, including an inability to lift arms for more than a few seconds, loss of ability to show facial expressions and serious speech impediments. These symptoms cause many people affected by FSHD to become dependent on the use of a wheelchair for mobility. FSHD affects both sexes equally, with onset typically in teenage and young adult years. The FSHD Society estimated FSHD affects approximately one in 20,000 people in the United States. A recent study conducted in the Netherlands reported a more frequent prevalence of one in 8,333 people. We believe that the patient population is between 16,000 to 38,000 in the United States. As is typical in diseases with no approved therapies, we believe that these patient population estimates are conservative.
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations
 
Currently there is no treatments for FSHD, and there are no therapies to treat the underlying cause of FSHD. Current approaches are focused on support for activities of daily living and mobility, improved functioning and lowering the risk of complications. They include physical therapy, exercise, pain management and orthopedic interventions. Two approaches are currently in Phase 2 development to treat FSHD but do not directly target DUX4, the driver of the disease.
Our Solution
 
AOC 1020 consists of our proprietary mAb that is designed to bind to TfR1 conjugated with a siRNA targeted to DUX4 mRNA to be administered as an intravenous infusion. Our preclinical data support our hypotheses on the potential advantages of AOC 1020. We believe these data suggest that AOC 1020 targets the root cause of FSHD, and may have the potential advantage of infrequent administration.
 
 We believe that the following specific characteristics of AOC 1020 position it to have advantages over historical and current efforts to develop an effective therapy for people with FSHD:
 
 
▪ | Addresses the underlying cause of the disease—AOC 1020 is designed to reduce the expression of the DUX4 mRNA, thereby reducing the expression of the DUX4 protein resulting in reduced expression of the downstream genes that are believed to cause FSHD. We believe these downstream genes can be used as biomarkers to assess the disease state and therapeutic activity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 9
 
 
▪ | Efficient delivery of drug substance to diseased cells— The TfR1 antibody component of the AOC is designed to facilitate efficient delivery to skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, an advantage over other companies previous unsuccessful efforts to deliver an unconjugated oligonucleotide into muscle cells. Once inside the muscle cells, the siRNA component of AOC 1020, siDUX4, acts to reduce levels of DUX4 mRNA. In preclinical models, we observed siRNA-mediated DUX4 silencing in muscle cells from patients with FSHD.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Reproducible and scalable therapeutic—As with all our AOCs, AOC 1020 is readily synthesized using well-established and scalable methods for manufacturing mAbs and oligonucleotides.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Data and Next Steps
 
Results from preclinical studies in FSHD patient myotubes and in an FSHD mouse disease model showed potent inhibition of DUX4-mediated gene signature in skeletal muscles. Results from a non-GLP, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study in NHP showed that AOC 1020 was well-tolerated at all doses tested following single and repeat dosing. We did not observe any dose-limiting toxicity at the highest dose tested based on in-life safety assessments. AOC 1020 produced a dose-dependent increase in siRNA plasma exposure following single doses, and AOC 1020 was observed to be stable in plasma with no evidence of degradation of the intact AOC. AOC 1020 also produced a dose-dependent increase in siRNA tissue exposure following single doses in a broad panel of muscle tissue. We believe these data support advancement of the AOC 1020 development program and potentially support an infrequent dosing regimen.
 

AOC 1020 is now in IND-enabling studies. Following regulatory clearance, we plan to advance AOC 1020 into a clinical trial by the end of 2022. 
 
We have partnered with the FSHD clinical trial research network, or FSHD CTRN, on the ongoing natural history study called Motor Outcomes to Validate Evaluations in FSHD (MOVE FSHD). We are sponsoring the MOVE Plus, or MOVE+, study which is enrolling approximately 100 participants in the US. The goal of MOVE+ is to enhance the community's understanding of how to utilize whole-body MRI and other tools to identify specific biomarkers for FSHD that can accelerate and support future clinical trial design.
 
Our Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Program
 
We are developing AOCs to treat the underlying cause of DMD, a monogenic, X-linked, recessive, neuromuscular disease that almost exclusively occurs in males. DMD is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for dystrophin, a protein critical for the normal function of muscle cells. The oligonucleotides in our AOCs are designed to promote the skipping of specific exons to allow the production of the dystrophin gene product. We are focusing our initial efforts on the development of AOCs for mutations amenable to skipping Exon 44, Exon 51 and Exon 45 and we intend to conjugate these individual oligonucleotides to our proprietary mAb targeting TfR1. We have three programs in development for DMD which target Exon 44, Exon 51 and Exon 45. Our first DMD program, AOC 1044 targeting Exon 44, is now in IND-enabling studies. Following additional preparatory preclinical studies and regulatory clearance, we plan to advance AOC 1044 into a clinical trial by the end of 2022. 
Disease Overview
 
In people with DMD, mutations in the affected gene hinder the production of normal levels of dystrophin protein, which is needed to maintain the integrity of muscle fibers. The absence of functional dystrophin leads to stresses and tears of muscle cell membranes, resulting in muscle cell death and the progressive loss of muscle function. A global database analysis characterized over 7,000 genetic mutations that cause DMD. Exons 44, 51 and 45 represent approximately 30% of the total mutations observed in DMD that are amenable to skipping. 
 
For people suffering from DMD, symptoms usually begin to manifest between three and five years of age. Affected people fail to reach developmental milestones or experience motor function challenges, such as difficulty walking or climbing stairs. Muscle wasting initially presents in the legs and pelvic area and later affects muscles of the shoulders, neck and arms, resulting in the inability to walk and dependence on a 
 10
 
wheelchair for mobility, and later becoming paralyzed from the neck down and requiring a ventilator to breathe. Though disease severity and life expectancy vary, a patient’s quality of life dramatically decreases over time, and death typically occurs by early adulthood from either cardiac or respiratory complications. DMD occurs in approximately one in every 3,500 to 5,000 live male births and is estimated to affect 10,000 to 15,000 people in the United States. The estimated prevalence of DMD in the European Union is similar to than that in the United States. 
 
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations
 
Currently people with DMD are treated with corticosteroids to manage the inflammatory component of the disease. There are three approved unconjugated PMO-based oligonucleotide therapies, each addressing a specific mutation. However, these drugs, in addition to requiring weekly intravenous infusions, have demonstrated a less than 6% mean increase in dystrophin in clinical trials. The FDA-approved labels for these drugs state that a clinical benefit has not yet been established and continued approval may be contingent upon the verification of such clinical benefit in confirmatory clinical trials. Additional approaches currently in clinical development include PPMOs and gene therapy. While there are therapies approved for Exon 51 and Exon 45 and multiple programs in clinical development for Exon 51, there are no therapies approved targeting Exon 44. 
Our Solution
 
Our initial development efforts in DMD are focused on AOCs based on PMOs that can induce exon skipping specifically for Exons 44, 51 and 45 conjugated to our proprietary mAb targeting TfR1. AOC 1044 is our lead program in development for DMD and targets Exon 44. We believe that our AOCs have the potential to increase the production of dystrophin in people with DMD for two reasons. First, because of recent advances in the understanding of the splicing process and placement of skipping agents on pre-mRNA described in published literature and based on these advances, we have screened for and identified PMOs with optimized skipping activity. Second, the mAb targeting TfR1 allows for more efficient delivery to muscle cells, therefore allowing for better uptake of the PMO. In preclinical studies, we also observed that our TfR1-based AOCs induced exon skipping in cardiac muscle, which we believe may address some of the cardiomyopathies in people with DMD, a key complication of the disease. Based on their mechanism of action, we believe that our AOCs could have utility in several additional DMD mutations beyond these first three.
Preclinical Data and Next Steps
 
In preclinical studies, we observed that treatment of an mdx mouse with an AOC caused a greater than 50-fold increase in exon skipping compared to an equimolar dose of the unconjugated oligonucleotide. In an mdx mouse model of DMD, a widely accepted mouse model in DMD, we observed that conjugating an oligonucleotide designed to bind to a specific exon can induce exon skipping and production of dystrophin protein more efficiently than unconjugated oligonucleotides. Fourteen days following treatment with a single 8mg/kg dose of a mouse Exon 23-targeting PMO conjugated to a mouse-specific- mAb targeting TfR1, we observed an approximately 50-fold increase in the degree of splice switching as compared to an equimolar dose of the unconjugated PMO).
 
Our first DMD program, AOC 1044 targeting Exon 44, is now in IND-enabling studies and we have preclinical programs for Exons 45 and 51. Following additional preparatory preclinical studies and regulatory clearance, we plan to advance AOC 1044 into a clinical trial by the end of 2022. 
 
Our Discovery Programs
 

Muscle Atrophy
 
Muscle atrophy is the loss of skeletal muscle mass that leads to muscle weakness and physical disability for patients. It is caused by a range of conditions spanning from rare genetic muscle diseases to common disorders like muscle wasting disease or cachexia.
 
11
 

Muscle atrophy is caused by a change in the balance between protein breakdown and protein synthesis signals. Muscle atrophy can be associated with the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways which induce protein degradation or inhibit growth factor pathways that promote protein synthesis. Genetic profiling of atrophic muscles has identified a group of ubiquitin ligases (E3 ligases) that are upregulated when muscle atrophy begins. In particular, muscle-specific E3 ligase muscle RING finger protein 1, or MuRF1, has been shown to be upregulated in muscle atrophy. Genetic ablation of MuRF1 in mice has been shown by third parties to render muscles partially resistant to various conditions of muscle atrophy. MuRF1 is a difficult target to address with traditional approaches like small molecules because of the gene family of E3 ligases, however, it may be able to benefit from the specificity of treatment achieved with a siRNA.
 
Our AOC for muscle atrophy is made up of our mAb targeting TfR1 and an oligonucleotide targeting MuRF1, and is designed to employ both the catabolic and anabolic pathways associated with the degradation of protein in muscle cells. We are focused on preclinical studies and identifying a muscle atrophy indication that we believe will be best suited for AOCs.
 
Pompe Disease
 
Pompe disease is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease that results in the toxic buildup of glycogen in the body’s cells, causing impairment of normal tissue and organ function. People with the infantile-onset form of the condition are most severely affected, suffering from progressive muscle weakness, respiratory deficiency, and heart problems. A late-onset form of Pompe disease can manifest in older patients and is generally associated with progressive weakness of the proximal muscles and varying degrees of respiratory weakness.
 
We are developing an AOC targeting the glycogen synthase 1, or GYS1, mRNA to diminish the toxic accumulation of glycogen in muscle. Reducing GYS1 in muscle will reduce the toxic accumulation of glycogen and we believe our approach may be complementary to enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, which is currently the only approved treatment for Pompe disease. Preclinical studies are ongoing.
 
Opportunities in Immunology, Immune Disorders and Cardiomyopathies
 
We intend to pursue the development of AOCs in other tissue and cell types, including immune cells. In the field of immunology, we believe AOCs have the potential to target a broader set of cell types and diseases than traditional oligonucleotide therapies. We believe oligonucleotide therapies have the potential to address the challenges of immune responses at the RNA level; however, the ability to modulate immune responses has been hampered by the inappropriate delivery of these agents to immune cells. By identifying and optimizing antibodies for specific immune cells, our goal is to leverage our AOC platform to develop product candidates that can deliver siRNAs to disease-driving subsets of immune cells.
 
In studies designed to explore AOCs in immuno-oncology, we observed significant AOC-mediated mRNA reduction in CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, in vivo in the syngeneic CT-26 tumor model with an intravenous dose of 6 mg/kg siRNA. However, we observed that the AOCs had no effect on the mRNA levels in T or B cells in the spleen, suggesting that activity can be limited to only the cell populations involved in immune-responses to tumors without affecting lymphocytes outside the tumor. We believe this specificity was driven by the fact that the AOC employed our mAb targeting TfR1, and TfR1 is over expressed only on activated lymphocytes. We also observed significant AOC-mediated mRNA reduction in CD4+ TILs and T-regs from mice treated with an AOC comprised of a mAb targeting TfR1 and a siRNA targeting SHP2.
 
We have also identified a mAb that binds to macrophages specifically, and when conjugated with a siRNA, produces reduction in levels of the target mRNA in that cell both in vitro and in vivo. We believe this finding supports the development of AOCs for diseases where macrophages play a significant role, like immune disorders. We are in the process of generating data to demonstrate the pharmacologic effects of siRNA reduction in animal models of immune disorders, which will help inform our future development plans. Our internal efforts are focused on finding additional surface protein-mAb pairs and demonstrating reduction in the expression of key targets in subsets of immune cells. As we identify appropriate product 
 12
 
candidates in immunology, we may choose to advance these on our own or seek a strategic collaborator based on the nature of potential indications. Our findings in immunology served as one of the key bases of our collaboration with Lilly who has access to a defined set of up to six mRNA targets initially in immunology and other select indications on a worldwide basis.
 Beyond immune cells, we plan to continue to invest in our AOC platform to explore the full potential of our AOCs in cardiomyopathies, as well as in additional previously inaccessible tissue and cell types. We entered into a collaboration with MyoKardia that, in combination with our internal discovery efforts, will help us expand our therapeutic activities to include cardiac-specific indications. Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize novel AOC therapeutics that overcome current barriers to the delivery of oligonucleotides and unlock their potential to treat a wide range of serious diseases currently lacking adequate treatment options.
 Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the antibodies, oligonucleotides and linkers used to make our AOCs, and we expect to continue to do so to meet our preclinical, clinical and commercial activities. Our third-party manufacturers are required to manufacture our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and other applicable laws and regulations. We believe there are multiple sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
With respect to AOC 1001, there are currently no approved therapies to treat the underlying cause of DM1. Products currently in development to treat DM1 include: tideglusib, a GSK3-ß inhibitor in late-stage clinical development by AMO Pharma for the congenital phenotype of DM1; AT466, which is an AAV-antisense candidate in preclinical development by Astellas Gene Therapies; a Fab linked oligonucleotide in preclinical development by Dyne Therapeutics Inc.; gene editing treatments in preclinical development by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; an RNA-targeting gene therapy in preclinical development by Locana, Inc.; and small molecules interacting with RNA in preclinical development by Expansion Therapeutics. There are a growing number of companies pursuing different paths to treat DM1 and we expect that the space will continue to evolve as additional candidates advance.
 
There are currently no therapies to treat the underlying cause of FSHD. Products currently in development to treat FSHD include: creatine monohydrate, a supplement that enhances muscle performance, which is being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial by Murdoch Children’s Research Institute; losmapimod, a p38 MAPK inhibitor that may modulate DUX4 expression, which is being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial by Fulcrum Therapeutics Inc; an antibody linked oligonucleotide in preclinical development by Dyne Therapeutics Inc.; and a ligand conjugated oligonucleotide in preclinical development by Arrowhead Therapeutics.
 
Currently people with DMD are treated with corticosteroids to manage the inflammatory component of the disease. Deflazacort is an FDA approved corticosteroid marketed by PTC Therapeutics, Inc. In addition, there are three FDA approved exon skipping drugs marketed by Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.: Eteplirsen, an unconjugated PMO approved for people with DMD amenable to skipping Exon 51; golodirsen for the treatment of people with DMD amenable to skipping Exon 53; and casimersen for the treatment of DMD in patients with a confirmed mutation amenable to exon 45 skipping. There is an FDA-approved exon skipping drug marketed by Nippon Shinyaku Co., Inc.: viltolarsen, an unconjugated PMO approved for people with DMD amenable to skipping Exon 53. Companies focused on developing treatments for DMD that target dystrophin mechanisms, as does our DMD program, include Sarepta Therapeutics with SRP-
 13
 
5051, a PPMO currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial for patients amenable to Exon 51 skipping , and PTC Therapeutics with ataluren, a small molecule targeting nonsense mutations in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition, several companies are developing gene therapies, including Milo Biotechnology (AAV1-FS344), Pfizer (PF-06939926), Sarepta Therapeutics (SRP-9001 and Galgt2 gene therapy program), and Solid Biosciences Inc. (SGT-001). Dyne Therapeutics Inc. has submitted an IND to the FDA to initiate a clinical trial of DYNE-251, a PMO conjugated to a Fab for treatment of patients with DMD amendable to skipping exon 51. We are also aware of several companies targeting non-dystrophin mechanisms for the treatment of DMD.
 Current treatments for muscle atrophy are primarily focused on nutritional intake and physical exercise. Other products in developments for muscle atrophy in cachexia include: adlumiz and AEZS-130, which are ghrelin agonists in a Phase 3 clinical trial by Helsinn Healthcare SA and a Phase 2 trial by Aeterna Zentaris Inc., respectively; GSK2881078, an androgen receptor modulator in Phase 2 clinical in development by GlaxoSmithKline plc; NGM120, a GSF15 inhibitor by NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc.; and PF-06946860 in Phase 1 clinical development by Pfizer Inc.
 
The only approved therapies for Pompe disease are Lumizyme (known as Myozyme outside of the United States) and Nexviazyme, ERTs delivered by bi-weekly intravenous infusion, and marketed by Sanofi Genzyme. We are aware of multiple ERT therapies in clinical development, including AT-GAA, which uses a pharmacological chaperone, with a BLA under FDA review submitted by Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. In addition, several companies are developing gene therapies, including Actus Therapeutics, Inc. (ACTUS101), Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc. (AAV2/8-LSPhGAA), Astellas Gene Therapies  (AT845) and Spark Therapeutics, Inc. (SPK-3006).
 
We will also compete more generally with other companies developing alternative scientific and technological approaches, including other companies working to develop conjugates with oligonucleotides for extra-hepatic delivery, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Aro Biotherapeutics, Arrowhead Therapeutics, Dyne Therapeutics, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Sarepta Therapeutics, DTx Pharma, Inc., PepGen, Inc., PeptiDream Inc. and Bicycle Therapeutics, as well as gene therapy and CRISPR approaches.
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of the entry of our products. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of other drugs. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety profile, convenience, level of promotional activity, intellectual property protection and availability of reimbursement.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect our product candidates and our AOC product platform through a variety of methods, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our AOC product platform, our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary 
 14
 
position. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how that may be important to the development of our business. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions to expand our intellectual property portfolio.
 
 We believe that we have a significant global intellectual property position and substantial know-how relating to our AOC product candidates and our technology platform. As of December 31, 2021, our intellectual property portfolio consisted of 13 issued U.S. patents and 29 pending U.S. patent applications that we own. Collectively, these patent rights relate to various aspects of our AOC product candidates and technology platform. In addition, we have an exclusive option to an exclusive license to certain patent rights from the University of Alberta. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we often file counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, New Zealand, Taiwan, and South Korea. We also file patent applications pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT. Our PCT patent applications are in the first phase of the PCT process, which is the international phase, in which patent protection is pending under a single patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, as a contracting state of the PCT. These PCT patent applications have not yet entered the second phase of the PCT process, which is the national and regional phase, in which rights are continued by filing necessary documents with the patent offices of separate contracting states of the PCT. The national phase of the PCT patent application process occurs 30 months after the earliest priority date of the PCT patent application.
 
We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new product candidates and platform technologies. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications in any appropriate fields if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, relating to the new technologies that we develop.
 
We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property strategy and portfolio.
 
Intellectual Property Relating to AOC 1001
 
With regard to AOC 1001, as of December 31, 2021, we owned one issued U.S. patent,  nine pending U.S. patent applications, 11 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions, and one pending patent application filed pursuant to the PCT. These patent rights relate to AOC 1001 composition of matter, formulations containing AOC 1001, methods of manufacturing, and methods of treating diseases, using AOC 1001. Any patents issued from these applications are expected to expire in 2038-2041; however, a patent term extension may be available.
 
Intellectual Property Relating to Our FSHD AOC Product Candidate
 
With regard to our FSHD AOC product candidate, as of December 31, 2021 we owned three pending U.S. patent application. These patent rights relate to the FSHD AOC composition of matter, formulations containing the FSHD AOC, methods of manufacturing, and methods of treating diseases, using our FSHD AOC. Any patents issued from these applications are expected to expire in 2041-2042; however, a patent term extension may be available.
Intellectual Property Relating to Our DMD AOC Product Candidates
 
With regard to our DMD AOC product candidates, as of December 31, 2021, we owned two issued U.S. patents, five pending U.S. patent applications and 24 pending patent applications in various countries and regions including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea. These patent rights relate to the DMD AOCs composition of matter, formulations containing the DMD AOCs, methods of manufacturing, and methods of treating diseases, using our DMD AOCs. Any patents issued from these applications are expected to expire in 2038-2042; however, a patent term extension may be available.
 15
 

Intellectual Property Relating to Our Muscle Atrophy AOC Product Candidate
 
With regard to our muscle atrophy AOC product candidate, as of December 31, 2021 we owned one issued U.S. patent, eight pending U.S. patent applications,  and 10 pending patent applications in various countries and regions including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea. These patent rights relate to the muscle atrophy AOC composition of matter, formulations containing the muscle atrophy AOC, methods of manufacturing, and methods of treating diseases, using our muscle atrophy AOC. Any patents issued from these applications are expected to expire in 2038; however, a patent term extension may be available.
Intellectual Property Relating to Our Pompe AOC Product Candidate
 
With regard to our Pompe AOC product candidate, as of December 31, 2021, we owned one pending patent application filed pursuant to the PCT. This application relates to the Pompe disease AOC composition of matter, formulations containing the Pompe disease AOC, methods of manufacturing, and method of treating diseases, using our Pompe disease AOC. Any patents issued from this application are expected to expire in 2041; however, a patent term extension may be available.
Intellectual Property Relating to Our AOC Product Platform
 
As of December 31, 2021, we owned 16 families of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications generally covering our AOC product platform. These families include t11issued U.S. patents, 28 pending U.S. patent applications, three PCT patent applications and 79 foreign patent applications in the European Patent Office, Australia, Canada, China, Israel, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore, New Zealand, and Taiwan, relating to key aspects and components of our AOC product platform systems. Our patent applications contain claims covering (i) proprietary antibodies; (ii) proprietary oligonucleotide chemical structures; (iii) proprietary oligonucleotide sequences;
 
(iv)proprietary AOC structures; and (v) methods for manufacturing and using our AOC technologies. Some of these AOC platform cases generically cover our various product candidates. The issued U.S. patents and any U.S. patents issuing from our pending U.S. patent applications are expected to expire between 2037 and 2042.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. However, the term of United States patents may be extended for delays incurred due to compliance with the FDA requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the USPTO. For example, for drugs that are regulated by the FDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act, it is permitted to extend the term of a patent that covers such drug for up to five years beyond the normal expiration date of the patent. In the future, if and when our biopharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2038 to 2042, unless we receive patent term extension or patent term adjustment, or both.
 
However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of oligonucleotide therapy has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our 
 16
 
intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or otherwise commercializing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our platform and product candidates and the methods used to manufacture them. Moreover, our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our platform’s product candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our AOC product platform and product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related platforms or product candidates or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our AOC product platform and product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive
 
advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our AOC product platform and product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before any product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. For this and other risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
We intend to file applications for trademark registrations in connection with our product candidates in various jurisdictions, including the United States. We have filed for trademark protection of the Avidity Biosciences mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent and trademark organizations.
 
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our confidential and proprietary information as trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements under the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result of the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions. Despite these efforts, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches.
 We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any 
 17
 
breach. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in relation to the resulting know-how or inventions. For more information, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Lilly 
 In April 2019, we entered into the Lilly Agreement with Lilly for the discovery, development and commercialization of antibody-oligonucleotide conjugate products, or Products, in immunology and other select indications on a worldwide basis. Under the Lilly Agreement, the parties will collaborate on preclinical research and discovery activities for Products and Lilly will be responsible for funding the cost of preclinical research and discovery activities of both parties for all Products. Lilly will lead the clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of all Products, at Lilly’s sole cost. 
 Under the Lilly Agreement, we granted Lilly an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under our technology to research, develop, manufacture, and sell Products directed to up to six mRNA targets. Lilly has the right to sublicense its rights under the Lilly Agreement subject to certain conditions. Lilly granted us a non-exclusive license under certain Lilly technology solely to conduct research under the Lilly Agreement. We retain the right to use our technology to perform our obligations under the Lilly Agreement and for all purposes not granted to Lilly. We agreed that we will not, ourselves or with a third party, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize or otherwise exploit any compound or product directed against targets subject to the collaboration. 
 Lilly paid us an upfront license fee of $20.0 million, and we are eligible to receive up to $60.0 million in development milestone payments, up to $140.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $205.0 million in commercialization milestone payments per target. In addition, Lilly is obligated to pay us a tiered royalty ranging from the mid-single to low-double digits on worldwide annual net sales of licensed Products, subject to specified and capped reductions for the market entry of biosimilar products, loss of patent coverage of licensed Products and for payments owed to third parties for additional rights necessary to commercialize licensed Products in the territory. Lilly’s royalty obligations and the Lilly Agreement will expire on a licensed Product-by-licensed Product and country-by-country basis on the later of ten years from the date of the first commercial sale or when there is no longer a valid patent claim covering such licensed Product in such country. 
 The Lilly Agreement may be terminated either by us or Lilly in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. Lilly may terminate the Lilly Agreement on a target-by-target basis or in its entirety without cause, subject to certain limitations, including that Lilly may not terminate the Lilly Agreement on a target-by-target basis within the first three years of the effective date of the Lilly Agreement if doing so would reduce the number of Products subject to the collaboration to fewer than a certain number. In the event either party commences a legal action challenging the validity or enforceability of any licensed patents, the other party will have the right to terminate the Lilly Agreement with respect to the challenged patents. 
 The Lilly Agreement includes various representations, warranties, covenants, dispute resolution mechanisms, indemnities and other provisions customary for transactions of this nature. 
 Concurrently with the Lilly Agreement, we issued a convertible promissory note to Lilly, or the Lilly Note, and received cash proceeds of $15.0 million. The Lilly Note accrued simple interest of 8.0% per annum and converted into shares of our Series C convertible preferred stock in November 2019. 
 Research Collaboration with Myokardia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb 
 In December 2020, we entered into a research collaboration with MyoKardia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb, to demonstrate the potential utility of AOCs in cardiac tissue by leveraging MyoKardia’s genetic cardiomyopathy platform including, among other aspects, its novel target discovery engine and proprietary cardiac disease models.

Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. 
 We believe our AOC product candidates may be subject to regulation in the United States as drug-biologic combination products. Combination products are comprised of components, such as drug components and biologic components, that would normally be subject to different regulatory frameworks by the FDA and frequently regulated by different centers at the FDA. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-biologic combination product is attributable to the biologic component, the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established the Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. A combination product with a primary mode of action attributable to the biologic component generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the biological product licensure processes set forth in the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and FDCA. In reviewing the marketing application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers would consult with their counterparts in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to ensure that the drug component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety and effectiveness. We believe our AOCs will be subject to the primary review of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and will require approval of Biologics License Application, or BLA, for the combination drug-biologic.
 U.S. Biologics Regulation 
 
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the FDCA, PHSA, and other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with GLP regulations and other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal trials; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19
 
 
● | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies, in an effort to support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, the trial sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product candidate, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the product candidate. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about ongoing or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP regulations, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND as well as any subsequent protocol amendments, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An independent IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
● | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage. Multiple Phase 2 trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 trials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20
 
 
● | Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA. 
 
While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 During the development of a new biologic, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before a BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach alignment on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the biological product candidate. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and biological characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. 
 BLA Review and Approval Process 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it 
 21
 
deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. 
 The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. Even if such  information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original BLAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric 
 22
 
subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to expedite FDA’s review and approval of biological products that meet certain criteria. The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. For example, product candidates are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
 A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation or breakthrough therapy designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for the product candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review). 
 Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA will generally the sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved 
 23
 
under accelerated approval on an expedited basis if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory trial or if such confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. 
 Fast track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | clinical holds on clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by the 
 24
 
manufacturer and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Biosimilars and reference product exclusivity
 The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 25
 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In addition to FDA regulation of pharmaceutical products, U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, civil monetary penalties laws, and physician and other healthcare provider payment transparency laws. In addition to the federal laws summarized below, we may also be subject to similar state and local laws and regulations that may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 26
 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made during the previous year to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other health care providers including, among others, physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held during the previous year by physicians as defined under statute and their immediate family members. 
 Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
 Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties including damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. 
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. In the United States, there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of a product, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
 
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Third-party

payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Additionally, decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
 U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States, there has been, and continues to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates. 
 Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA.  Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the law.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. The likelihood of success for these and other proposals to control drug costs is uncertain, particularly in light of the new Biden administration. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, or EU, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 To market a medicinal product in the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), we must obtain a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: 
  
● | the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment certain diseases, such as AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and

● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.

Data and marketing exclusivity 
 In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 Pediatric investigation plan 
 In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the EU and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. 
 Clinical trials 
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCPs. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the European Union, it must appoint an entity within the European Union to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial. 
 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The application for a clinical trial authorization must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, clinical trial authorization applications must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to take effect in 2019, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements also apply. 
 Data Privacy and Security Laws 
 We are subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, 
 30
 
including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, and the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation.  Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
