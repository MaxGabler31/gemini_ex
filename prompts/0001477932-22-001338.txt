ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History

We were incorporated under the name Imagine Media, Ltd. in August 2007 to publish and distribute Image Magazine, a monthly guide and entertainment source for the Denver, Colorado area. We generated only limited revenue and essentially abandoned the business plan in January 2009. On September 19, 2011, we, Imagine Media, Ltd., a Delaware corporation, acquired approximately 52% of the outstanding shares of TransBiotec, Inc. ( “TBT”), a California corporation, from TBT’s directors in exchange for 12,416,462 shares of our common stock.

On January 17, 2012, our Board of Directors amended our Certificate of Incorporation changing our name from Imagine Media, Ltd. to TransBiotec, Inc.

On January 31, 2012, we acquired approximately 45% of the remaining outstanding shares of TBT in exchange for 10,973,678 shares of our common stock.

With the acquisitions in September 2011 and January 2012 of TBT common stock, we own approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of TBT.

As a result of the acquisitions, TBT’s business is our business, and, unless otherwise indicated, any references to the “Company,” “we” or “us” include the business and operations of TBT.

On March 9, 2020, in connection with our transaction with IDTEC, LLC (as detailed herein) our Board of Directors approved the amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation on March 9, 2020 and stockholders holding 52.24% of our then outstanding voting stock approved the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation. The Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation was for the purpose of, among other things, (i) changing our name from “TransBiotec, Inc.” to “SOBR Safe, Inc.”, (ii) effecting a 1-for-33.26 reverse stock split of our common stock, and (iii) decreasing our authorized common stock from 800,000,000 shares to 100,000,000 shares, and became effective with the State of Delaware on April 24, 2020.

As a result of the reverse stock split effected by our Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, every 33.26 shares of our outstanding common stock prior to the effect of that amendment were combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock, and the number of outstanding shares of our common stock at the time was reduced from 266,097,657 (pre-split) to approximately 8,000,000 (post-split). No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split, and any of our stockholders that would have been entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the reverse stock split will instead receive one additional share of our common stock in lieu of the fractional share. The reverse stock split did not in itself affect any stockholder’s ownership percentage of our common stock, except to the extent that any fractional share were rounded up to the nearest whole share.

At the open of trading on June 8, 2020, our new name and reverse stock split went effective with OTC Markets, and we began trading on the “OTC Pink Current Information” tier of OTC Markets on a post reverse stock split basis. Our ticker symbol for the quotation of our common stock is now “SOBR”. On November 16, 2020, we began trading on the “OTCQB” tier of OTC Markets.

Our common stock is currently quoted on the “OTCQB” tier of OTC Markets under the ticker symbol “SOBR”. We have engaged Alexander Capital LP regarding conducting a firm underwritten offering of the Units in connection with an uplist to Nasdaq. We are planning to complete an uplist to Nasdaq within the three months.

Business Overview

General

We intend to provide companies with non-invasive technology to identify potential alcohol issues quickly and safely with its employees or contractors, that if left undetected could cause injury or death. These technologies will be integrated within our robust and scalable data platform, producing statistical and measurable user and business data. Our mission is to save lives, increase productivity, create significant economic benefit for our customers, and positively impact behavior. To that end, we developed the scalable, patent-pending SOBRSafe™ software platform for non-invasive alcohol detection and identity verification, a solution that has anticipated applications in commercial vehicle fleets, manufacturing and warehousing, construction, and for commercial fleet and youth drivers in a wearable form. We believe that uniform daily use of our device could result in material insurance savings across Workers’ Comp, general liability and fleet policies.

We have successfully completed several pilot testing programs involving our SOBRcheck™ device, which is our first device that has our scalable, patent-pending SOBRSafe™ software platform for non-invasive alcohol detection and identity verification.  These pilot programs have provided validation of both our SOBRSafe™ software platform and our SOBRcheck™ device.  As a result, we have now progressed to commercial production of our first SOBRcheck™ devices which we began using for our initial customers.  At the end of 2021, we had several customers in the sales cycle, but our SOBRcheck™ devices were not delivered to them until January 2022.  As a result, we will not invoice these customers or receive any revenue from the customers until the first quarter of 2022. The timing of our commercial launch of our SOBRcheck™ device has been delayed several times in 2021 primarily as a result of our pursuit of adequate financing (since obtained), signing up pilot customers to test our device (which was more difficult over the summer due to travel schedules, etc. of some of our target customers), and some supply chain issues largely caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.   In addition, during the pilot testing of our SOBRcheck™ device we discovered that alcohol-based hand sanitizer caused false readings by the device.  In response to this discovery, we have made adjustments to the analytics in our SOBRSafe™ technology and added a required protocol of not utilizing alcohol-based sanitizers to our protocols for using the SOBRcheck™ device.

Our second device, a wearable wristband (SOBRsure™), utilizes the same SOBRsafe™ sensor technology, which proved out during the SOBRcheck™ pilot tests. The primary intended application for this band is for young individual drivers and commercial fleet management, with an additional potential application in alcohol rehabilitation. We plan for the wearable band to be commercially available in August 2022. 

Manufacturing and assembly of our SOBRcheck™ device will take place in the United States. We currently utilize two companies for manufacturing of the SOBRcheck device. We utilize Alfred Manufacturing for the injection molding of the SOBRcheck device, and Nova Engineering for the assembly, packaging, and shipping of the device. We do not have agreements in place with these companies and we operate with them on a purchase order/payment basis. We supply a purchase order, which they fulfill, and then they send us an invoice. 

Our SOBRsafe™ technology can also be deployed across numerous additional devices for various uses; among those we are currently exploring include possible integrations with existing telematics systems, and it could be licensed by non-competitive third parties. Currently, our plan is to deploy our SOBRSafe™ technology in two initial devices: the SOBRcheck™ system and the wearable band (SOBRsure™). 

SOBRcheck™

SOBRcheck™ is our stationary identification and alcohol monitoring product. When installed, SOBRcheck™ enables a rapid, hygienic biometric finger scan to authenticate ID and determine the presence or absence of alcohol. The SOBRcheck™ product will provide the employer with real-time results, delivered securely, to more efficiently manage their existing substance abuse policy. Our device is meant to be a specific point in time, quick test for the presence of alcohol, with the results to be used as a complementary data source in support of the employer’s alcohol policies.  If alcohol is detected by the device, then our customers follow up in accordance with its own policies, which could include additional tests via a blood test or breathalyzer (we will not provide these devices).  We will gather de-identified information regarding Pass/Fail tests for use in determining trends in a company and/or industry, etc. but such information does not include any specific data about the individual user, only whether a pass or fail   result occurred.  We initiated a structured approach to gathering market intelligence in the first quarter of 2021, and launched our direct sales program in October 2021.

Wearable Band

The transdermal, alcohol-detecting wearable band contains our SOBRsafe™ technology for ongoing, real-time alcohol monitoring. We intend to make the band commercially available by August 2022.

Once commercialized, our SOBRcheck™ revenue model consists of a recurring monthly SaaS fee per user. Upon commercial launch of the wearable band SOBRsure™, we plan to employ a one-time device purchase price and a monthly per user subscription fee.

We believe our device portfolio approach could yield a substantial repository of results based data. This de-identified data can be leveraged for future product improvements and trending analysis – a potentially monetizable asset for additional analytics. The opportunity to collect a substantial volume of data points over time could enable the development of business and insurance liability benchmarking, and through AI, powerful guidance for perpetual safety improvement (and associated cost savings capture). By demonstrating alcohol-free environments, employers could deliver a data-driven argument for lowering insurance premiums. We could potentially partner with insurance providers to mandate use of the SOBRsafe™ devices and/or technology.

In addition to focusing on the development, marketing and commercialization of the SOBRcheck™ and SOBRsure™, we are also constantly reviewing emerging and/or synergistic technologies and businesses for potential acquisitions and/or partnerships, primarily technologies that detect, or may detect, the presence of substances in the human body.

The Substance Abuse Problem

Our management believes the key to developing a successful product is to find a potential solution to a need not being adequately addressed with current technologies. When that need also involves a potential solution for a societal crisis – like the impact of substance abuse on the workplace and individual lives – then the motivation is even stronger, and the potential results that much more impactful.

Through criminal-justice related costs, lost work productivity and healthcare expenses, the annual cost of alcohol abuse in the U.S. is estimated to be $249 billion. Half of all industrial accidents involve alcohol, and commercial fleets suffer from over 11,000 alcohol-related accidents each year. We believe our technology provides a solution that addresses this problem.

Competitive Advantages 

Once commercialized, SOBRsafe™ will be a leading provider of preventative transdermal (touch-based) alcohol detection systems in the U.S. market – we seek to eliminate the possibility of alcohol-related accidents and not simply punish the offender post-fact. Companies like SCRAM, BACTRACK, BI TAD, Soberlink, Smart Start, Intoxalock and others are primarily focused on the judicially-mandated market, i.e. breathalyzers for blood alcohol content (BAC) measurement, or court-ordered ankle monitors. 

Our SOBRcheck™ device is a patent-pending, touch-based identity verification and alcohol detection solution. A user places two fingers on the device’s sensors: one compares biometric data points from the finger to confirm identity, while the other senses alcohol released through the pores of the fingertip.

Marketing

We have developed a marketing plan that includes 1) outsourced multi-channel appointment setting, 2) direct sales, 3) popular and trade media public relations, 4) advocacy group alignment, 5) dynamic social media brand development and 5) continuous pursuit of cutting-edge detection technologies for future integration.

We have recently concluded pilot programs with a global employer, a major commercial insurer and Michigan’s largest food management company. The pilot programs were successful, and we have moved into the revenue generation phase.

Research and Development 

Our SOBRsafe™ system for non-invasive alcohol detection and identity verification has been completed and tested. Based on the results of testing, including in a live pilot program with Michigan’s largest food management company, we believe the system is ready for broad commercial use and our direct sales efforts are underway.

SOBRcheckTM, the patent-pending, multiuser, touch-based alcohol detection platform with identity detection, evidenced outstanding performance in pilot testing and is now available for broad commercial installation.

Intellectual Property 

We currently have the following patent and patent applications related to our SOBRsafe™ system and related devices:


1) | U.S. Patent No. 9,296,298, titled “Alcohol detection system for vehicle driver testing with integral temperature compensation”, which expires in 2032.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Provisional Patent Application No. 63,014,776, titled “Non-invasive Transdermal Alcohol Screening System” 
3) | Provisional Patent Application No. 63,109,134, titled “Wearable Data Collection Device w/Non-Invasive Sensing” 


We are applying for trademarks related to the SOBRsafe™ system, SOBRcheck™ and SOBRsure™. We have also applied for trademark registration for “SOBR” as standard characters with no specific formatting.

Government Regulation

At the present time, only the judicially mandated market is regulated. Devices sold into this market must be approved by state government agencies. Since we utilize a unique “Pass/Fail” methodology that simply alerts to the presence of alcohol (as opposed to measuring a discrete BAC) – information that may be used at the discretion of the employer (or counselor, parent, etc.) – we do not believe we will be subject to any government regulation.
Employees

As of March 11, 2022, there are a total of 9 full time employees, including Chairman/CEO/Secretary David Gandini, CFO Jerry Wenzel, EVP and Chief Revenue Officer Michael Watson, and EVP of Operations Scott Bennett.
Human Capital Resources

The remainder of our workforce is consultants due to the nature of our business. As it relates to our employees and the consultants that work with us:
Oversight and Management

Our executive officers are tasked with leading our organization in managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning and talent management and development. We are committed to providing team members with the training and resources necessary to continually strengthen their skills. Our executive team is responsible for periodically reviewing team member programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices. Management periodically reports to the Board regarding our human capital measures and results that guide how we attract, retain and develop a workforce to enable our business strategies.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to monitor and improve the application of our hiring, retention, compensation and advancement processes for women and underrepresented populations across our workforce, including persons of color, veterans and LGBTQ+ to enhance our inclusive and diverse culture. We continue to invest in recruiting diverse talent.
Workplace Safety and Health

A vital part of our business is providing our workforce with a safe, healthy and sustainable working environment. We focus on implementing change through workforce observation and feedback channels to recognize risk and continuously improve our processes.

Importantly during 2021, our focus on providing a positive work environment on workplace safety have enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues and workplace visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. We took immediate action at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to enact rigorous safety protocols in our facilities by improving sanitation measures, implementing mandatory social distancing, use of facing coverings, reducing on-site workforce through staggered shifts and schedules, remote working where possible, and restricting visitor access to our locations. We believe these actions helped minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce.
