Item 1. Business.
Overview
Manning & Napier, Inc. is an independent investment management firm that provides our clients with a broad range of financial solutions and investment strategies. Founded in 1970 and headquartered in Fairport, New York, we serve a diversified client base of high-net-worth individuals and institutions, including 401(k) plans, pension plans, Taft-Hartley plans, platforms, endowments and foundations. Our investment strategies offer equity, fixed income and a range of blended asset portfolios by employing traditional and quantitative approaches. 
Since our inception, our objective has been to create and develop deep client relationships, allowing us to understand our client's financial needs and objectives. Our goal is to provide comprehensive solutions, high-touch service, and attractive investment strategies in today’s ever-changing financial marketplace.
Initially, this approach helped us build a client base of high-net-worth individuals, small business owners and middle market institutions using separately managed accounts, and we maintain these relationships in many targeted geographic regions. Over time, we were able to expand on this foundation with additional strategies and solutions, including the use of mutual funds and collective investment trusts to serve larger institutions, defined contribution plans, and unions as well as those clients that may utilize investment consultants or other intermediaries. 
A key aspect of our client service approach is a commitment to retaining internal subject matter experts that can provide consultative services beyond investment management, which we believe helps us attract new clients and build close relationships with existing clients. We have designed solutions that can be tailored to specific client needs, such as our family wealth management service, endowment and foundation services, and custody and trust services. We believe this service-oriented approach, combined with competitive long-term investment performance, has allowed us to achieve a high average annual separate account retention rate throughout our history. 
From an investment standpoint, our strategies are designed to provide competitive absolute returns over the long-term by employing time-tested, disciplined research processes. While the mechanics of these processes may differ depending on the strategy, all of our solutions work from the underlying belief that active management is the best investment approach for meeting long-term client objectives. Additionally, our investment team's compensation structure has been designed with a focus on aligning our business outcomes with positive client outcomes.
Over the course of our nearly 50 year history, we view our team-based, client-centric approach as imperative to our success and distinct within the industry. As of December 31, 2018, we have twelve mutual fund share classes rated with four or five stars by Morningstar, and a number of our investment strategies have built value-added track records over multiple decades. Recently, however, the three- and five-year performance of several of our key strategies has been mixed. 
Performance challenges, along with the trend toward passive investing, especially amongst institutional investors, resulted in assets under management ("AUM") declines starting in 2014. Our active approach can cause us to be out of favor relative to benchmarks and/or peers over shorter time periods, and these short-term deviations can lead to changes in AUM trends over time. The following chart reflects our AUM as of December 31 for each of the last 10 years:

1

As of December 31, 2018, our investment management offerings include approximately 49 distinct separate account composites and 58 mutual funds and collective investment trusts. We believe we have cultivated a robust menu of actively managed strategies that address client needs including traditional, quantitative, and specialized portfolios.
Our AUM as of December 31, 2018 by investment vehicle and portfolio were as follows:

The following table summarizes the annualized returns for several of our key investment strategies and relevant benchmarks. Since inception and over long-term periods, we believe our strategies have earned attractive returns on both an absolute and relative basis. We recognize, however, that some key strategies have mixed track records over the past several years. These strategies are used across separate account, mutual fund and collective investment trust vehicles, and represent approximately 78% of our AUM as of December 31, 2018.

(2) | The market cycle performance numbers are calculated from April 1, 2000 to December 31, 2018. We believe that a full market cycle time period should contain a wide range of market conditions and usually consists of a bear market, recovery and bull market stage. Our definition of the current market cycle includes the bear market that began with an abrupt decline in the technology sector (4/1/2000 - 9/30/2002), the subsequent failed recovery (10/1/2002 - 10/31/2007), the financial crisis bear market (11/1/2007 - 2/28/2009), and the current bull market (3/1/2009 - current). The period utilized in our current market cycle may differ from periods used by other investment managers.

Our Strategy
Our mission has always been a complete focus on doing what is best for our clients, and it is our highest priority to deliver superior results and service. In achieving those results, we strive for continuous refinement and improvement of our investment disciplines. The asset management business is a dynamic industry, and meeting client goals and objectives will require constant evolution. Our focus on delivering excellent investment results, exceptional client service, and innovative solutions will help our clients achieve their financial goals and form the foundation for our business.
We believe Manning & Napier’s investment solutions have been time-tested, and our approach is focused on the characteristics highlighted below.
Team-Based Research Engines
With a research department of over 60 investment professionals, we are committed to a team-based approach in order to best ensure that success can be repeated over time. All of our investment strategies are managed by portfolio teams, allowing the stability of process to take precedence over any individual personality. We take a home-grown approach to maintaining our research engines. We believe this enhances the consistency with our time-tested philosophies and provides a source of future analysts to address growth and turnover. As warranted, we may also add to or supplement our research teams with additional investment professionals through corporate development activities. The latest example of this is the Rainier International Small Cap Team that was added as part of our acquisition of Rainier Investment Management, LLC ("Rainier") in 2016. The Director of Investments and Managing Directors of the Firm’s investment groups are responsible for talent management and ensuring day-to-day adherence to our strategies and disciplines.
Multi-Channel Sales Teams
We have a deep multi-channel sales structure, which includes Direct, Intermediary and Platform/Sub-Advisory channels. Our Direct channel maintains relationships with high-net-worth individuals, middle market institutions, Taft-Hartley plans and large institutions working with a consultant. Our high-touch strategy allows us to build strong relationships over time. Our Intermediary teams work with national brokerage firms, independent financial advisors, and retirement plan advisors to provide solutions for their clients. Manager research teams approve our strategies for their platforms through our Platform/Sub-Advisory Channel. Our client-facing teams maintain relationships with the client or intermediary after the initial sale, ensuring that our strategies and solutions are meeting the needs of the clients. 
Innovative Investment Strategies
We have a history of investing in our business to support innovation. Our ongoing development of new investment strategies has historically been a source of growth. A dynamic market and regulatory environment presents challenges for investors. Whether through innovative investment strategies or bespoke client-specific custom solutions, we will continue to evolve in order to meet the ever-changing needs of our clients. We regularly review our group of seeded portfolios to ensure that we are supporting competitive strategies that resonate with clients while redeeming portfolios that are no longer viable. As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $6.1 million invested in seed capital with our research teams in new strategy concepts and expect to continue to deploy capital to support innovation in the future.
Enhanced Consultative Services
Offering holistic, tailored consultative services has been a source of both new business and client retention over our history. Some of our planning capabilities include estate and tax review for families, asset/liability modeling for defined benefit pension plans, retirement and health plan design analysis for employers, and donor relations and planned giving services for endowment and foundation clients. Many of these services are offered through our Client Analytics Group, a team of internal consultants whose primary responsibilities include working with prospective and current clients to solve investment and financial planning-related problems. We continue to see interest in our consultative advisory service, which allows us to tailor investment portfolios among proprietary and non-proprietary investments (e.g., ETFs) to meet client objectives. We have both gained new relationships, as well as enhanced existing relationships, by providing this solution. Additionally, we also offer

practice management concepts and tools to both wealth advisors and retirement plan advisors to assist in their new business and service efforts. 
Investment Disciplines and Fundamentals
We manage a variety of equity, fixed income, and blended asset strategies, using an array of portfolio construction approaches including bottom-up, top-down, and quantitative. These strategies are offered to clients in a variety of different vehicles, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, collective investment trusts, and as model portfolios. 
We believe that active management, in all of its many forms, is the most appropriate and relevant investment approach to achieving client goals across changing market environments. Whether investing in a country, industry, or individual company, we hold a strong belief that price matters across all of our strategies. We are focused on helping our clients avoid permanent loss of capital over long time horizons, which is different than managing day-to-day volatility. 
We use a team-based approach across our investment strategies and research engines to best understand market opportunities. Our team approach allows analysts to combine top-down, bottom-up, and quantitative research. Additionally, by focusing on research teams instead of individuals, we are better able to emphasize repeatable processes instead of star personalities, while helping protect clients from staff turnover.
Sales, Service, and Marketing
We promote our strategies and solutions through direct sales to high-net-worth individuals, middle market institutions, Taft-Hartley plans, and larger institutional clients that are working with consultants. We also have dedicated efforts to sell through financial intermediaries and platforms. In identifying new potential prospects, we focus on individuals and institutions that have long-term objectives and are looking for a partner in addressing those needs. We believe our problem-solving approach fosters strong relationships and helps to manage long-term expectations.
As of December 31, 2018, we had over 50 sales professionals, with an average of approximately 19 years of industry experience. Our direct national sales representatives cover large, multi-state territories, prospecting large institutions, retirement plans and Taft-Hartley relationships. Our direct regional sales representatives cover smaller territories, and they pursue both individual and middle market institutional business opportunities. Our intermediary salesforce includes external wholesalers, internal wholesalers, and key account representatives, and the group covers both retirement plan advisors and wealth management advisors. Lastly, our Portfolio Strategies Group maintains deep knowledge of all of our products, and they are primarily responsible for maintaining consultant relations and providing field support for our client-facing teams.
Our sales representatives include generalists and teams focused on specific client types or markets. Representatives are responsible for generating new business as well as maintaining existing business. In addition to our marketing strategies, referrals are also an important source of new business, further highlighting the importance of our client service and solution efforts. To assist the sales representatives, we have over 30 service professionals who are responsible for responding to client requests and questions.
Our marketing strategy is focused on finding new ways to connect and engage with clients and prospects via targeted content on products, services, and topics that are most relevant to our various audiences. We have dedicated resources creating engaging and relevant content that positions Manning & Napier as a thought leader and a trusted resource. This content strategy focuses on educating investors, and it mirrors the consultative nature of our firm. We disseminate content in various ways, including through print publications, email, webinars, live events, our website, and social media. 
Competition
Historically, we have competed to attract assets to manage principally on the basis of:

• | a broad portfolio and service offering that provides solutions for our clients;


• | the disciplined and repeatable nature of our team-based investment processes;


• | the quality of the service we provide to our clients and the duration of our relationships with them;


• | our pricing compared to other investment management products offered;


• | the tenure and continuity of our management and team-based investment professionals; and


• | our long-term investment track record.

Our ability to continue to compete effectively will also depend upon our ability to retain our current investment professionals and employees and to attract highly qualified new investment professionals and employees. We compete in all aspects of our business with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions.

Structure
 The Company was incorporated in 2011 as a Delaware corporation, and is the sole managing member of Manning & Napier Group, LLC and its subsidiaries (“Manning & Napier Group”), a holding company for the investment management businesses conducted by its operating subsidiaries. The diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2018.
 
________________________

(1) | The consolidated operating subsidiaries of Manning & Napier Group include Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC ("MNA"), Perspective Partners LLC, Manning & Napier Information Services, LLC, Manning & Napier Investor Services, Inc., Exeter Trust Company and Rainier Investment Management, LLC ("Rainier").

As of December 31, 2018, we had 366 employees, most of whom are based in Fairport, New York. Collectively, William Manning, our co-founder and Chairman of the Board, current employee-owners and former employee owners own approximately 81.8% of Manning & Napier Group and our operating subsidiaries. We believe that our culture of employee ownership aligns our interests with those of our clients and shareholders by delivering strong long-term investment performance and solutions.
Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States at the federal level and, to a lesser extent, the state level and by self-regulatory organizations. We are also subject to regulations outside of the United States. Under certain of these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines.
SEC Regulation
Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC ("MNA") is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, (the "SEC"), as an investment adviser under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, ("the Advisers Act"). Additionally, the Manning & Napier Fund, Inc., (the "Fund"), and certain of the third-party investment companies we sub-advise are registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, (the "1940 Act"). The Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, together with the SEC’s regulations and interpretations thereunder, impose substantive and material restrictions and requirements on the operations of advisers and mutual funds. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an adviser’s registration.
6

As an investment adviser, we have a fiduciary duty to our clients. The SEC has interpreted these duties to impose standards, requirements and limitations on, among other things:

• | trading for proprietary, personal and client accounts;


• | allocations of investment opportunities among clients;


• | use of soft dollars;


• | execution of transactions; and


• | recommendations to clients.

We manage accounts for a majority of our clients on a discretionary basis, which typically affords us the authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker-dealers to execute trades and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with designated trade executions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker-dealers, which effectively reduces certain of our expenses. We believe all of our soft dollar arrangements comply with the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"). If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of statutory amendments or new regulations, our operating expenses would increase.
As a registered adviser, we are subject to many additional requirements that cover, among other things:

• | disclosure of information about our business to clients;


• | maintenance of formal policies and procedures;


• | maintenance of extensive books and records;


• | restrictions on the types of fees we may charge;


• | custody of client assets;


• | client privacy;


• | advertising; and


• | solicitation of clients.

The SEC has authority to inspect any investment adviser and typically inspects a registered adviser periodically to determine whether the adviser is conducting its activities (i) in accordance with applicable laws, (ii) consistent with disclosures made to clients and (iii) with adequate policies, procedures and systems to ensure compliance.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, 23% of our revenues were derived from our advisory services to investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, including 21% derived from our advisory services to the Fund. The 1940 Act imposes significant requirements and limitations on a registered fund, including with respect to its capital structure, investments and transactions. While we exercise broad discretion over the day-to-day management of the business and affairs and investment portfolios of the Fund and the investment portfolios of the funds we sub-advise, our own operations are subject to oversight and management by each fund’s board of directors. Under the 1940 Act, a majority of the directors must not be “interested persons” with respect to us (sometimes referred to as the “independent director” requirement). The responsibilities of the board include, among other things, approving our investment management agreement with the Fund; approving other service providers; determining the method of valuing assets; and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. Our investment management agreements with the Fund may be terminated by the funds on not more than 60 days’ notice, and are subject to annual renewal by the Fund board after their initial term.
The 1940 Act also imposes on the investment adviser to a mutual fund a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of the adviser’s investment management fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC through administrative action or litigation by investors in the fund pursuant to a private right of action.
Under the Advisers Act, our investment management agreements may not be assigned without the client’s consent. Under the 1940 Act, investment management agreements with registered funds (such as the mutual funds we manage) terminate automatically upon assignment. The term “assignment” is broadly defined and includes direct assignments as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in us. 
Manning & Napier Investor Services, Inc. ("MNBD"), our SEC-registered broker-dealer subsidiary is the distributor for the Fund and is subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule, which requires that at least a minimum part of a registered broker-dealer’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. MNBD was in compliance with its net capital requirements during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
7

FINRA Regulation
MNBD is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") and as such is subject to the various industry and professional regulations, standards, and reporting requirements established by FINRA.
ERISA-Related Regulation
We are a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, with respect to assets that we manage for benefit plan clients subject to ERISA. ERISA, regulations promulgated thereunder and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "IRC"), impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions.
The fiduciary duties under ERISA may be enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor by administrative action or litigation and by our benefit plan clients pursuant to a private right of action. In addition, the IRS may assess excise taxes against us if we engage in prohibited transactions on behalf of or with our benefit plan clients.
New Hampshire Banking Regulation
Exeter Trust Company is a state-chartered non-depository trust company subject to the laws of the State of New Hampshire and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the New Hampshire Bank Commissioner.
Non-U.S. Regulation
In addition to the extensive regulation to which the investment management industry is subject in the United States, we are also subject to regulation by various Canadian regulatory authorities in the Canadian provinces where we operate pursuant to exemptions from registration. We are authorized to act as a non-resident sub-advisory investment manager to collective investment vehicles in Ireland. Our business is also subject to the rules and regulations of the more than 30 countries in which we currently buy and sell portfolio investments.
