ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Overview
XPO Logistics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a leading provider of freight transportation services. We use our proprietary technology to move goods efficiently through our customers’ supply chains, primarily by providing less-than-truckload (“LTL”) and truck brokerage services. These two core lines of business generated the majority of our 2021 revenue and operating income.
Our company has two reportable segments — (i) North American LTL and (ii) Brokerage and Other Services — and within each segment, we are a leading provider in vast, fragmented transportation sectors with growing penetration. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 42,000 employees and 771 locations in 20 countries serving over 50,000 multinational, national, regional and local customers. In addition to our scale, we believe that our substantial exposure to secular industry growth trends, our first-mover advantage as an innovator and our blue-chip customer relationships are compelling competitive advantages.
We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain challenges on all aspects of our business, including how they affect our employees, customers and business partners. See “Impacts of COVID-19 and Supply Chain Challenges” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Spin-off of the Logistics Segment
On August 2, 2021, we completed the previously announced spin-off of our Logistics segment in a transaction intended to qualify as tax-free to XPO and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which was accomplished by the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of GXO Logistics, Inc. (“GXO”) to XPO stockholders. XPO stockholders received one share of GXO common stock for every share of XPO common stock held at the close of business on July 23, 2021, the record date for the distribution. XPO does not beneficially own any shares of GXO’s common stock following the spin-off. GXO is an independent public company trading under the symbol “GXO” on the New York Stock Exchange. The historical results of GXO are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts in this Annual Report refer to continuing operations, including comparisons to the prior year.
North American Less-Than-Truckload Segment 
XPO is a top three provider of LTL services in North America — we have one of the industry’s largest asset-based networks of tractors, trailers, drivers and terminals, and approximately 8% share of the $42 billion LTL market as of December 31, 2020. We provide our customers with geographic density and day-definite regional, inter-regional and transcontinental LTL freight services. Our services include cross-border U.S. freight movements to and from Mexico and Canada, as well as intra-Canada service. 
We have relationships with approximately 25,000 LTL customers in North America, the majority of which are local accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we delivered approximately 13 million LTL shipments.
In addition to reliable national capacity, the other key factors driving our LTL growth and margin expansion are our proprietary technology and the industry’s favorable fundamentals: limited commoditization, rational pricing dynamics, rising industrial demand and the continued growth of e-commerce, which is driving frequent shipments of freight that doesn’t require an entire truck. 
Specific to XPO, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to leverage our technology to improve LTL profitability beyond the sizable margin gains we have already achieved. We use intelligent route-building to move LTL freight across North America, and proprietary visualization tools to help reduce the cost of pickups and deliveries. Our XPO Smart™ productivity tools are deployed in our LTL yards and cross-dock operations, and we have developed a pricing platform that enables our pricing experts to be much more productive and will enhance our ability to price in a dynamic marketplace.
We are taking action in the five areas of our previously announced action plan to drive growth and enhance network efficiencies in our LTL business. We began executing the plan in October 2021. The five areas of our plan are:
•Improve network flow. Our targeted fourth quarter 2021 initiatives have significantly improved network fluidity, while generating stronger service metrics in areas such as on-time transit and freight handling as the quarter progressed;
•Drive pricing. We pulled our typical January 2022 general rate increase forward to November 2021 and instituted accessorial charges for detained trailers, oversized freight and special handling, contributing to record 11% growth in yield, excluding fuel, in the fourth quarter;
•Expand the driver base. We graduated approximately 900 professional drivers from our driver training schools in 2021, exceeding our goal, and intend to double the number of 2021 graduates in 2022; 
•Increase trailer production. In January 2022, we added a second production line at our Searcy, Arkansas trailer manufacturing facility. We expect to double the number of units produced in 2022 year-over-year; and
•Expand footprint by 900 net new doors (approximately 6%) by year-end 2023. We added a total 149 net doors to the network from October 2021 through January 2022 with the opening of three new terminals: Chicago Heights, Illinois; Sheboygan, Wisconsin; and Texarkana, Arkansas. Additionally, we plan to open new fleet maintenance shops in Ohio, Florida, New York and Nevada in the first quarter of 2022.
Brokerage and Other Services Segment 
XPO is the second largest truck broker worldwide, and one of the largest in North America, with approximately 3% share of the $80 billion North American market as of December 31, 2021. Shippers create truckload demand and we place their freight with qualified carriers, pricing our service on either a spot or contract basis. Our truck brokerage business has an agile, non-asset model with a variable labor structure that generates a high return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion. 
The key factors driving growth and margin expansion in our truck brokerage business are massive capacity, cutting-edge technology and favorable industry tailwinds. The demand for truckload capacity in the e-commerce and omnichannel retail sectors is growing rapidly. At the same time, more and more shippers are outsourcing to brokers and increasingly preferring brokers like XPO that offer digital capabilities.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 98,000 independent truckload carriers in our global brokerage network, representing more than a million trucks. We provide our customers with digital access to truckload capacity through our XPO Connect® brokerage technology. This proprietary platform is a major differentiator for our business and, together with our pricing technology, we believe it can unlock incremental profitable growth well beyond our current levels. 
Our Brokerage and Other Services segment also includes exposure to a fast-growing brokerage subsector — last mile logistics for heavy goods sold through e-commerce, omnichannel retail and direct-to-consumer channels. XPO is the largest last mile provider for heavy goods in North America.
Several other non-core brokered freight transportation modes are included in this segment, as well as our European service offering. XPO holds leading positions in key geographies in Europe: we are the No. 1 truck broker and the No. 1 LTL provider in France and Iberia (Spain / Portugal), and the No. 3 truck broker in the U.K., where we also have the largest single-owner LTL network.
Innovation and Sustainability
Our first-mover advantage as an industry innovator is rooted in the more than $3 billion we have spent on technology on all operations since 2011. We concentrate our efforts on creating “smart” supply chains that create meaningful value for our shareholders and our customers.
Technology is a major competitive differentiator for us. We use it to serve our customers better and make the most of the talent and assets within our organization. Our cloud-based ecosystem speeds the deployment of new ways to deliver transportation services to customer sectors that are increasingly interested in digitization and automation.
Environmental sustainability is another significant priority for us, and one that is increasingly connected to our technology. Our entire business model is based on transporting freight as efficiently as possible. This fosters our ability to improve our carbon footprint over time by reducing empty miles, maintaining a modern fleet and executing company-specific initiatives, such as training our drivers in eco-friendly techniques. 
We’re committed to reducing the impact of our operations on the environment, especially with respect to climate change and biodiversity, while helping our customers do the same. In 2020, we developed a scorecard to provide a progressive means of evaluating the management of our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) initiatives and incentivizing long-term, successive achievements. Our ESG scorecard tracks measurable progress with our environmental initiatives over four years, taking into account lead time requirements, category weighting and target variances. 
The environmental initiatives within the scorecard encompass strategic objectives of reducing fossil fuel dependency, carbon emissions and carbon footprint, nitrogen oxide emissions and waste. These objectives are 
underpinned by specific goals — for example, we’re working to achieve greater fuel efficiency in our managed transportation business, with an annual goal of averaging at least seven miles per gallon every year for four years. We also set a goal to reduce carbon emissions in our LTL business by increasing the load factor rate by at least 2% over the performance period. Together with five other categories of ESG-related targets, the environmental initiatives in our ESG scorecard provide a roadmap for XPO.
As we execute our sustainability strategy, we’re focusing on three critical areas: our transportation fleet, technology and facilities. 
Transportation Fleet 
Our business relies heavily on the availability and pricing of diesel fuel to provide our transportation services. In 2021, we switched to 100% premium diesel for our fleet. Because premium diesel is higher in cetane — analogous to octane in gasoline — it burns cleaner, lubricates better and runs more smoothly. On the road, this translates to fuel savings in the range of 1.8% to 2.5%, with commensurate reductions in carbon emissions.
Our ongoing fleet initiatives include modernizing our tractors and trailers; deploying cleaner fuels where practical, such as natural gas, biogas and electricity; expanding our use of data and software analytics to improve the efficiency of routing, loading and handling freight; and exploring the use of lighter vehicles with a smaller environmental footprint. Our scale gives us the ability to explore options locally and replicate improvements across our company.
In North American LTL, we’re investing in replacing many of our older tractors and trailers, including more than $100 million allocated to buy approximately 1,000 new tractors in 2022. The supply chain challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the retirement of older tractors and limited our ability to secure new models in 2021. As newer vehicles become available, we will continue to introduce trucks with 15-liter engines and automatic transmissions that improve reliability and fuel economy, while lowering emissions and extending engine life.
In Europe, over 90% of our diesel road fleet is compliant with Euro VI standards, and we have a natural gas-powered fleet of more than 250 total trucks in France, the U.K., Spain and Portugal. We also use government-approved mega-trucks in Spain to transport more freight with fewer trips. We’re currently testing the use of longer, duo-trailer vehicles that have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by an estimated 25% to 30% per trip, compared with the same freight moved on traditional trucks. In 2021, we piloted the first fully electric commercial trucks in our fleets in Spain and France, and our last mile business uses electric vehicles for certain deliveries, reducing those emissions to zero. 
Electric vehicles show promise in commercial transport applications, particularly as a zero-emission alternative to diesel for urban service. Our fleet experts are working with manufacturers to test the commercial viability of larger electric vehicles, and we put our first electric truck into service in 2021. This initiative is serving as a valuable pilot to advance our understanding of how and where to best use electric vehicles.
Technology 
For many of our customers, the transportation components of their supply chain account for a significant portion of their CO2 footprint. We use machine learning and other technologies, leveraged by our scale, to coordinate the movement of goods in ways that are greener, safer, more efficient and more cost-effective. 
Our four key priorities are:
•Improved utilization of truck capacity. In our LTL business, our routing algorithms are designed to keep our trucks fuller over more miles, thus reducing “empty miles.” In our truck brokerage business, our XPO Connect® digital platform matches shippers with carriers for the optimal movements of freight, reducing inefficiencies and sourcing backhauls for carriers with empty trucks following deliveries.
•Enhanced driver performance. XPO drivers receive eco-training to reinforce techniques for fuel efficiency, and we digitally track drivers’ habits on the road. This helps us improve their individual driving efficiency and safety. 
•Data-driven visibility. Our technology follows a shipment from pickup to delivery, with real-time visibility into where goods are and when they will be delivered. Digital tracking mitigates inefficiencies and allows us to assimilate data into future planning models to improve accuracy and performance. 
•Emissions reduction. We use big data to predict freight volumes and plan capacity, which helps us determine the optimal vehicle or mode of transportation. In some cases, we can shift non-urgent loads to reliable, lower-carbon options, such as rail. In 2021, XPO moved 217,000 rail shipments in the U.S., which reduced greenhouse gas emissions by over 540,000 metric tons, compared with moving the same freight by truck.
Facilities 
Our expertise in the circular economy continues to enhance the eco-profile of our facilities and operating practices. We have ongoing initiatives underway to install LED lighting in our buildings, reuse pallets, right-size packaging and incorporate other environmentally friendly processes into our operations. We cut waste by reusing materials where feasible and recycling a growing share of waste.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to help customers move their goods most efficiently through their supply chains. We deliver value in the form of technological innovations, process efficiencies, cost efficiencies and reliable outcomes. Our services are both highly responsive to customer goals, such as mitigating environmental impacts over time, and proactive in identifying potential improvements. Most important, we have instilled a culture that defines success as mutually beneficial results for our company and our customers.
Management’s growth and optimization strategy is to:
•Market our solutions and vertical expertise to new and existing customers of all sizes, using a partnership approach that creates enduring relationships;
•Leverage our positioning to increasingly capitalize on secular trends in demand, such as the rapid growth of e-commerce and the heightened customer interest in outsourcing freight transportation;
•Recruit and retain talented sales and customer service representatives, and continuously improve their productivity with state-of-the-art training and technology; 
•Attract and retain high-caliber independent contracted carriers and independent brokered carriers for our non-asset services; and
•Integrate industry best practices into our operations, with a focus on automation and analytics that drive productivity and market share gains.
Additionally, each of our core businesses executes a strategy of competitive differentiation:
•In North American LTL — recruit and retain quality drivers for our fleet, and best utilize our capacities of drivers, equipment, terminals and technology for a superior customer experience; and
•In truck brokerage — leverage the advantages of our proprietary XPO Connect® digital marketplace to grow our share of the brokerage sector and penetrate the for-hire trucking industry.
Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property
One of the ways in which we strengthen our relationships with customers is by empowering our employees to deliver superior service through our technology. Our industry is evolving, and customers want to de-risk their supply chains through robust visibility and digitization. We are already well-positioned to provide this value to customers, because we prioritized visibility, control and automation early in the development of our proprietary technology. 
We have built a highly scalable platform on the cloud that enables us to deploy innovations across multiple geographies in a relatively short time, and also take an innovation developed for one of our services and apply it to other services. This differentiates the value we offer and gives our larger accounts an added incentive to use us.
We believe that our investment in technology is among the highest in our industry at an annual average of approximately $300 million. The most significant impacts of our technology to date are in these areas:
XPO Connect® is our proprietary digital freight marketplace; it encompasses our core Freight Optimizer system, shipper interface, API integration, pricing engine, tracking engine, carrier interface and our carrier mobile app, called Drive XPO®. This fully automated, self-learning digital freight platform gives us a scalable framework to continually improve our service, capture share and reduce costs.
XPO Connect® gives shippers access to our transportation network and market data, while freight carriers transact to secure loads through the app. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 98,000 carriers registered for XPO Connect® globally and over 600,000 cumulative truck driver downloads of the app. In the fourth quarter of 2021, 70% of our brokerage orders in North America were created or covered digitally.
In LTL, our technology focuses on optimizing the main components of the service we provide: linehaul, pickup-and-delivery and pricing. Our North American LTL linehaul network moved freight approximately 2.5 million miles a day on average in 2021. In total, we moved 18 billion pounds of LTL freight 758 million miles in 2021.
With intelligent route-building, we can reduce empty miles in our linehaul network, improve load factor and mitigate cargo damage. Our proprietary bypass models assimilate massive amounts of data to arrive at recommendations based on volume and density, taking freight dimensions into account to identify gaps in trailer utilization. With pickup-and-delivery, we are focused on optimizing routing, pricing management, trailer utilization, exception management and dock productivity through our technology.
XPO Smart™ is our proprietary suite of intelligent tools and analytics that self-adjusts site by site to drive productivity across our LTL terminal operations. Our software incorporates dynamic data science, predictive analytics and machine learning to aid our managers in workflow decision-making. We use XPO Smart™ to improve our labor in a safe, disciplined and cost-effective manner.
Customers and Markets
We provide services to more than 50,000 customers ranging in size from small, entrepreneurial organizations to Fortune 500 companies and global leaders. The diversification of our customer base minimizes concentration risk: in 2021, our top five customers combined accounted for approximately 9% of our revenue, with our largest customer accounting for approximately 3% of revenue.
Our markets are also highly diversified. The customers we serve span every major industry and touch every part of the economy. Our revenue derives from a mix of key verticals, such as industrial and manufacturing, retail and e-commerce, food and beverage, logistics and transportation and consumer goods.
We market our services to customers with domestic and international supply chains, and primarily perform these services in North America and Europe. In 2021, approximately 72% of our total revenue was generated in the U.S., 11% in France, 7% in the U.K. and 6% in Europe (excluding France and the U.K.).
Competition
XPO operates in highly fragmented marketplaces along with thousands of companies competing domestically and internationally. We compete on quality of service, reliability, scope and scale of operations, technological capabilities, expertise and price. 
Our competitors include local, regional, national and international companies that offer the same services we provide, including C.H. Robinson, FedEx, Old Dominion Freight Line and Saia. Some of our competitors have significantly more customers, resources and experience than we have, and some of our customers have sufficient internal resources to perform the services we offer. Due to the competitive nature of our marketplaces, we strive daily to strengthen existing business relationships and forge new relationships.
The health of the freight transportation industry overall will continue to be a function of domestic and global economic growth. However, we believe that we have positioned XPO in fast-growing sectors to benefit from secular trends, such as the demand for e-commerce, omnichannel retail and supply chain outsourcing.
Regulation
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies in the U.S. and in other countries where we conduct business. These regulations impact us directly and also indirectly when they regulate third-party providers we arrange and/or contract with to transport freight for our customers.
Regulations Affecting Motor Carriers, Owner-Operators and Transportation Brokers. In the U.S., our subsidiaries that operate as motor carriers, freight forwarders, and freight transportation brokers are licensed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). Our motor carrier subsidiaries and the third-party motor carriers we contract with in the U.S. must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those related to, without limitation, controlled substances and alcohol, hours-of-service compliance, vehicle maintenance, hazardous materials compliance, driver fitness, unsafe driving, and minimum insurance requirements, as well as the Compliance Safety Accountability (“CSA”) program, which uses a Safety Measurement System (“SMS”) to rank motor carriers on seven categories of safety-related data, known as Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (“BASICs”).
Other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), also regulate our equipment, operations, cargo and independent contractor drivers. We are also subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements in certain states and local jurisdictions where we operate, as are the third-party carriers with which we contract. In foreign jurisdictions where we operate, our operations are regulated by the appropriate governmental authorities. We may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to emissions, drivers’ hours-of-service, independent contractor eligibility requirements, onboard reporting of operations, air cargo security and other matters affecting safety or operating methods.
Regulations Affecting Our Subsidiaries Providing Ocean and Air Transportation. One of our subsidiaries, XPO Customs Clearance Solutions, LLC (“XCCS”), is licensed as a U.S. Customs broker by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the “CBP”) of the DHS in each U.S. district where it performs services. All U.S. Customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the CBP. In non-U.S. jurisdictions where we perform customs brokerage services, our operations are licensed, where necessary, by the appropriate governmental authorities.
Our subsidiaries that offer expedited air charter transportation are subject to regulation by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) of the DHS governing air cargo security for all loads, regardless of origin or destination. Some of our subsidiaries are regulated as “indirect air carriers” by the TSA. The CBP, TSA and relevant non-U.S. governmental agencies provide requirements and guidance and, in some cases, administer licensing requirements and processes applicable to the freight forwarding industry.
To facilitate our international operations, XPO is a member of the International Air Transportation Association (“IATA”), a voluntary association of airlines and freight forwarders that outlines operating procedures for forwarders acting as agents or third-party intermediaries for IATA members. A substantial portion of our international air freight business is transacted with other IATA members.
Additionally, some of our subsidiaries are licensed as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary (“OTI”), since they operate as a non-vessel-operating common carrier (“NVOCC”), and/or as an Ocean Freight Forwarder (“OFF”) licensed by the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”), which establishes the qualifications, regulations, licensing and bonding requirements for arranging international transportation to or from the U.S. as an OTI.
Our OTI operations are subject to regulations of the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of Treasury, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission and to various laws and regulations of the other countries where we operate. These laws and regulations govern what commodities may be shipped to certain destinations and end-users, unfair international trade practices, limitations on entities with which we may conduct business and related matters.
Other Regulations. We are subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption statutes, and export sanction laws. We are also subject to state and U.S. federal laws and regulations addressing some types of cargo transported or stored by our subsidiaries, or transported pursuant to a government contract or subcontract.
Classification of Independent Contractors. U.S. tax and other federal and state regulatory authorities, as well as private litigants, continue to assert that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors, while applying a variety of standards in their determinations of independent contractor status. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements and heighten the penalties for companies that misclassify workers and are found to have violated overtime or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor, which allows taxpayers that meet certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a longstanding, recognized practice. Federal legislators also sought to expand the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover “non-employees” who perform labor or services for businesses, even if said non-employees are properly classified as independent contractors; require taxpayers to provide written notice to workers based upon their classification as either an employee or a non-employee; and impose penalties and fines for violations of the notice requirement or for misclassifications. Some states have launched initiatives to increase tax revenues from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation and income taxes, and the reclassification of independent contractors as employees could help states increase these revenues. In addition to these possible legislative changes, the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) and NLRB's general counsel have signaled the desire to reverse several pro-employer precedents, to make it more difficult for a worker to be classified as an independent contractor by changing the factors used in determining worker classification. The NLRB has also entered into a Memorandum Of Understanding with the U.S. Department of Labor regarding the exchange of information and cooperation in enforcement activities regarding the misclassification of employees as independent contractors. If the independent contractor drivers that provide services to XPO are determined to be our employees, we could incur additional exposure under some or all of the following: federal and state employer taxes, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, and labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.
Environmental Regulations. Our operations and our independent contractors are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate. In the U.S., these laws and regulations deal with the hauling, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, emissions from vehicles, engine-idling, fuel tanks and related fuel spillage and seepage, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters that involve inherent environmental risks. We may be responsible for the cleanup of any spill or other incident involving hazardous materials caused by our business. In the past, we have been responsible for the cost to clean up diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events, and none of these incidents materially affected our business or operations. We generally transport only hazardous materials rated as low-to-medium-risk, and only a small percentage of our total loads contain hazardous materials.
We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations, and we do not know of any existing environmental condition that reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. 
Risk Management and Insurance
We maintain insurance for commercial automobile and trucker’s liability, commercial general liability, cargo legal liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, umbrella and excess liability, cyber risk, and property coverage with coverage limits, deductibles and self-insured retention levels that we believe are reasonable given the varying historical frequency, severity and timing of claims. Certain actuarial assumptions and managerial judgments are made for insurance reserves and are subject to a degree of variability.
Seasonality
Our revenue and profitability are typically lower for the first quarter of the calendar year relative to other quarters. We believe this is due in part to the post-holiday reduction in demand experienced by many of our customers, which leads to less use of our services. 
The productivity of our tractors and trailers, independent contractors and other transportation providers generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations. It is not possible to reliably predict whether our historical revenue and profitability trends will continue to occur in future periods.
Human Capital Management
At XPO, every action we take is based on our values – we are safe, entrepreneurial, respectful, innovative and inclusive. Our values shape our approach to human capital management and ensure we provide an excellent work environment for our employees. Our success relies heavily on our strong governance structure, Code of Business Ethics, good corporate citizenship and commitment to employee engagement. 
As a customer-centric company with a strong service culture, we continually strive to be an employer of choice. This requires an unwavering commitment to workplace inclusion and safety, professional growth opportunities and competitive total compensation that meets the needs of our employees and their families. 
Employee Base Profile
We had approximately 42,000 employees in locations spanning 20 countries as of December 31, 2021, with approximately 21,000 employees in North American LTL and approximately 21,000 employees in Brokerage and Other Services, including corporate. Our workforce is supplemented with approximately 5,400 temporary workers.
By geography, approximately 66% of our employees are based in North America, approximately 33% are in Europe and approximately 1% are in Latin America and Asia combined. By job description, approximately 57% of our employees work as drivers and dockworkers, approximately 25% work as operations and warehouse workers and approximately 9% work in field supervisory and management positions with the remainder in support and other positions. In North America, approximately 78% of our employees occupy hourly roles and approximately 22% are in salaried positions. By gender, approximately 18% of our global employees are female and approximately 23% of global managerial positions (manager or supervisor and above) are occupied by women. Women also comprise approximately 45% of our global salaried field and non-field professionals, and approximately 22% of all U.S. employees at vice president level and above, an increase of more than three percentage points from 2020. By ethnicity, almost 40% of our U.S. employees are ethnically or racially diverse, with representation of Black and African American colleagues surpassing the U.S. census by seven percentage points. Approximately 30% of colleagues in U.S. managerial positions (manager or supervisor and above) identify as ethnically or racially diverse.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 88% of our employees in Europe were represented by unions or other employee representative bodies. In the U.S., less than 1% of our employees are represented by a union.
Throughout 2021, we made significant investments in the safety, well-being and satisfaction of our employees in the following areas, among others:
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DE&I”)
We take pride in having an inclusive workplace that encourages a diversity of talents and perspectives. We welcome employees of every gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, life experience and disability. Led by our chief diversity officer, we celebrate diversity through our heritage month celebrations, including Black history, women’s history, LGBTQ+ pride, Hispanic heritage, Native American heritage, Asian American heritage and military veterans. We offer inclusivity courses through our XPO University e-learning portal. We also engage in academic partnerships that advance diversity in higher education, including our collaboration with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (“HBCUs”) and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. We sponsor inclusion programs and employee resource groups that support employee heritage, women, veterans, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities and other multicultural groups. Commitments added in 2021 include a partnership with Hiring our Heroes, a DE&I global employee portal and “Table Talk” conversations on DE&I topics with XPO leaders. 
ESG Initiatives in Long-Term Incentives. Our commitment to long-term and successive ESG achievements is demonstrated through our ESG scorecard, which we introduced in 2020 with more than 40 defined ESG targets and initiatives that span a four-year period through 2023. Our ESG scorecard deliverables are organized into six categories that are tied to performance on: (1) employee safety; (2) sustainability; (3) information security; (4) diversity and human capital management, among other areas of ESG. Goals include targets for turnover rates, gender and ethnic diversity growth in managerial positions and DOT recordable preventable accident frequency in both managed transportation and LTL. These ESG performance targets and initiatives, including deliverables for diversity and inclusion, are linked to 25% of our top executives’ long-term incentive compensation.
Health and Safety
The physical and emotional safety of our employees is our top priority, and we have numerous protocols in place to ensure a safe work environment. In the U.S., we aim to maintain an Occupational Safety and Health Administration total recordable incident rate (“TRIR”) that is less than half the published rate for the Truck Transportation industry based on the “Industry Injury and Illness Data” from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”). In 2021, our North American Transport business unit exceeded our target expectation with a TRIR 2.63 points lower than the BLS national benchmark. 
Another way we work to decrease occupational injuries and illnesses is through our global Road to Zero program. Road to Zero instills safety and compliance awareness through education, mentoring, communication and on-the-job training. In addition to physical well-being, we also consider emotional well-being to be an important part of workplace safety. Our Code of Business Ethics mandates zero tolerance of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, bullying and other unacceptable behaviors to ensure all employees feel welcome at work. Our open-door policy provides multiple channels for employees to report any incidents, including our anonymous Ethics Point hotline and website, along with any supervisor, manager or member of the HR team. 
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve continued to prioritize employee physical and mental health and have aimed to balance protecting employee health while creating a comfortable work environment. We remain diligent in upholding XPO’s COVID-19 safety protocols, including daily health attestations, a contactless delivery policy for our drivers and customers and access to mental health counseling services for employees and their dependents. We continue to offer pandemic paid sick leave to provide U.S. and Canadian employees up to an additional two weeks of fully-paid sick leave.
Talent Development and Engagement
Employee Engagement. At XPO, we regularly solicit feedback from employees to gauge our progress, assess satisfaction and encourage constructive suggestions. Each quarter, we solicit feedback from our global “wired” employees through an online satisfaction survey. In the U.S., we also conduct an annual satisfaction survey among our “non-wired” frontline employee audience in addition to regular roundtables and town halls. Based on employee 
feedback, we identify improvement areas and develop action plans at the business unit and facility level to implement improvements.
We also foster career development at all levels and seek to recruit and retain the best talent available. Our talent development infrastructure includes these activities and programs, among others: 
Recruitment. We tailor our recruitment efforts by geography and job function using an array of channels. We proactively recruit through advertisements tailored for individual roles, and we use a range of different sources to search for potential candidates. For example, through our recruiting partnerships, we advertise open positions on recruitment websites targeted toward women, LGBTQ+ individuals, Blacks and African-Americans, Hispanics, veterans and those who are disabled. Our goal is to identify candidates who have the skills our customers need – or the desire to learn those skills. Specifically, we partner with Hiring our Heroes to attract military veterans and WorkFit, the Down’s Syndrome Association’s employment program.
Modern Hire. Our integrated approach to talent development begins with the recruitment platform we launched this year. It includes job previews, on-demand interviewing and scheduling and pre-employment assessments to improve and personalize the candidate experience, allowing candidates to choose opportunities with XPO that best match their skills and interests. These features also reduce time demands of the candidate and improve employee retention by allowing candidates to learn about XPO and the role for which they’re applying prior to joining XPO.
Grow at XPO. This program offers tailored skills development, training and mentoring for employees who aspire to grow into higher-paying positions with more responsibility at XPO. Grow at XPO is intended primarily to create opportunities for employees from minority populations or underrepresented communities.
Driver School. XPO’s driver training schools are instrumental in our driver recruitment efforts, enabling us to teach new drivers. We have 130 driver training schools in our network and graduated approximately 900 students in 2021. Our driver training program is also a critical component of our driver retention strategy, as our retention rate on average over the past two years for internal driver school graduates is more than 30 percentage points higher than that of external driver hires. Our recent enhancements to student compensation and training options are industry-leading and include free tuition, guaranteed wages for instruction hours, on-the-job training and other benefits. In contrast to the BLS-reported national average age of 46 years old for employees in the Truck Transportation industry, approximately 80% of our 2021 student driver hired population is below 40 years of age with nearly half of students between the ages of 25-34 years old. We plan to expand our graduate count in 2022 to double our graduates in 2021. 
XPO Graduate Program (LTL). We maintain a robust “ready now” pipeline of future operations leaders by using structured sponsorships and incidental learning techniques. These programs are designed to develop internal candidates who demonstrate high potential in supervisory roles, preparing them to become site leaders. The programs also help retain top talent by defining personalized development paths, and they attract new talent by differentiating XPO from its competitors.
XPO RISE. Our executive training program for high-potential managers launched in the U.S. in 2021 and will launch in Europe in 2022. This program emphasizes our commitment to promote from within and increase gender diversity in executive management roles by providing cross-functional leadership experience via special projects, collaboration with peers and mentoring from XPO executives.
XPO University. Our learning and development platform encompasses online and in-person programs, including JumpStart onboarding, management training and skills development. In 2021, more than one million training hours were completed by our employees worldwide. 
Expansive Total Rewards 
We appreciate that our employees choose to work for XPO from among many options inside and outside our industry. We offer a total compensation package that is both competitive and progressive to attract and retain outstanding talent. 
Competitive Wages. In 2021, total compensation expense for employees (i.e., excluding contingent workers) rose by 13%, or $389 million, reflecting both concentrated and broad-based investments in wage increases for more than 22,000 hourly workers throughout the year, and annual merit-based and promotional increases for our salaried employees. In addition, we hired nearly 15,000 employees globally at competitive rates as we continued to invest in the company’s growth, innovation and commitment to deliver relentlessly for our customers. 
Comprehensive Benefits. We offer a comprehensive suite of health and welfare benefit programs to support employees and their families. Many of these benefits are offered because of employee feedback. In the U.S., examples include:
•Pregnancy Care Policy: guarantees up to 80 hours of paid prenatal leave and certain automatic accommodations, plus consideration of more significant accommodations.
•Family Bonding Policy: provides 100% paid time off for six weeks for the primary caregiver of a newborn or newly adopted child, and 100% paid time off for two weeks for a secondary caregiver.
•Tuition Reimbursement: provides up to $5,250 annually for continuing education, tuition-free commercial driver training and education discounts for more than 80 fields of online study.
•Additional Benefits: including access to a Total Rewards Statement, assistance with diabetes management, supplemental insurance and short-term loans. 
In Europe, XPO’s benefit programs vary by country and are tailored to the needs of local markets. Examples include comprehensive healthcare and risk insurances, employee assistance programs covering mental, physical and financial well-being, commercial driver training, vocational coaching and training and a full flexible benefits program in the U.K.
Community Involvement
In 2021, there were hundreds of examples of our company and employees giving back, including our support of the Susan G. Komen Foundation, Truckers Against Trafficking, Soles4Souls, Girls With Impact, Toys for Tots, Elves & More and the Make-A-Wish Foundation, among others.
