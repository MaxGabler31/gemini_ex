 ITEM 1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
  
  BACKGROUND AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE
  
  Know Labs, Inc., formerly Visualant, Incorporated, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 1998. Since 2007, we have been focused primarily on research and development of proprietary technologies which can be used to authenticate and diagnose a wide variety of organic and non-organic substances and materials. Our Common Stock trades on the OTCQB Exchange under the symbol “KNWN.”
 BUSINESS
  
  We are focused on the development, marketing and sales of a proprietary technologies which are capable of uniquely authenticating or diagnosing almost any substance or material using electromagnetic energy to create, record and detect the unique “signature” of the substance. We call these our “ChromaID™” and “Bio-RFID™” technologies.
 Overview
  
  Historically, the Company focused on the development of our proprietary ChromaID technology. Using light from low-cost LEDs (light emitting diodes) we map the color of substances, fluids and materials and with our proprietary processes we can authenticate, identify and diagnose based upon the color that is present. The color is both visible to us as humans but also outside of the humanly visible color spectrum in the near infra-red and near ultra-violet and beyond. Our ChromaID scanner sees what we like to call “Nature’s Color Fingerprint.” Everything in nature has a unique color identifier and with ChromaID we can see it, and identify, authenticate and diagnose based upon the color that is present. Our ChromaID scanner is capable of uniquely identifying and authenticating almost any substance or liquid using light to create, record and detect its unique color signature. We will continue to develop and enhance our ChromaID technology and extend its capacity. More recently, we have focused upon extensions and new inventions that are derived from and extend beyond our ChromaID technology. We call this technology Bio-RFID. The rapid advances made with our Bio-RFID technology in our laboratory have caused us to move quickly in to the commercialization phase of our Company as we work to create revenue generating products for the marketplace. We will also, as resources permit, pursue licensing opportunities with third parties who have ready applications for our technologies.
  
  In 2010, we acquired TransTech Systems, Inc. as an adjunct to our business. TransTech is a distributor of products for employee and personnel identification and authentication. TransTech has historically provided substantially all of the Company’s revenues. The financial results from our TransTech subsidiary have been diminishing as vendors of their products increasingly move to the Internet and direct sales to their customers. While it does provide our current revenues it is not central to our current focus as a Company. Moreover, we have written down any goodwill associated with its historic acquisition. We continue to closely monitor this subsidiary.

  The Know Labs Technology
  
  We have internally and under contract with third parties developed proprietary platform technologies to uniquely authenticate or diagnose almost any material and substance. Our technology utilizes electromagnetic energy at various points along the electromagnetic spectrum to perform analytics which allow the user to identify, authenticate and diagnose depending upon the application and the unique field of use. The Company’s proprietary platform technologies are called ChromaID and Bio-RFID.
  
  The ChromaID patented technology utilizes light at the photon (elementary particle of light) level through a series of emitters and detectors to generate a unique signature or “fingerprint” from a scan of almost any solid, liquid or gaseous material. This signature of reflected or transmitted light is digitized, creating a unique ChromaID signature. Each ChromaID signature is comprised of from hundreds to thousands of specific data points.
  
  The ChromaID technology looks beyond visible light frequencies to areas of near infra-red and ultraviolet light and beyond that are outside the humanly visible light spectrum. The data obtained allows us to create a very specific and unique ChromaID signature of the substance for a myriad of authentication, verification and diagnostic applications.
  
  Traditional light-based identification technology, called spectrophotometry, has relied upon a complex system of prisms, mirrors and visible light. Spectrophotometers typically have a higher cost and utilize a form factor (shape and size) more suited to a laboratory setting and require trained laboratory personnel to interpret the information. The ChromaID technology uses lower cost LEDs and photodiodes and specific electromagnetic frequencies resulting in a more accurate, portable and easy-to-use solution for a wide variety of applications. The ChromaID technology not only has significant cost advantages as compared to spectrophotometry, it is also completely flexible is size, shape and configuration. The ChromaID scan head can range in size from endoscopic to a scale that could be the size of a large ceiling-mounted florescent light fixture.
  
  In normal operation, a ChromaID master or reference scan is generated and stored in a database. We call this the ChromaID Reference Library. The scan head can then scan similar materials to identify, authenticate or diagnose them by comparing the new ChromaID digital signature scan to that of the original or reference ChromaID signature or scan result. Over time, we believe the ChromaID Reference Libraries can become a significant asset of the Company, providing valuable information in numerous fields of use. The Reference Libraries for Bio-RFID will have a similar promise regarding their utility and value.
  
  The Company’s latest technology platform is called Bio-RFID. Working in our lab over the past year, we have developed extensions and new inventions derived in part from our ChromaID technology which we refer to as Bio-RFID technology. While we are in the early stages of the development of this technology, we have recently announced that we have successfully been able to non-invasively ascertain blood glucose levels. We are building the internal and external development team necessary to commercialize this newly discovered technology as well as make additional patent filings covering the intellectual property created with these new inventions. The first applications of our Bio-RFID technology will be in a product we call the UBAND™. The first UBAND product will be marketed as a real time calorie counter. It is a wearable product which will be worn on the wrist and communicate with a smart phone device via Bluetooth connectivity. It will provide the user with real time information on their caloric consumption from carbohydrates.
  
  We have recently announced the results of laboratory-based comparison testing between our Bio-RFID technology and the leading continuous glucose monitors from Abbott Labs (Freestyle Libre®) and DexCom (G5®). These results provide evidence of a high degree of correlation between our Bio-RFID based technology and the current industry leaders. Our technology is fundamentally differentiated from these industry leaders as it is completely non-invasive.
  
  We expect to begin the process of obtaining US Food and Drug Administration approval of our non-invasive continuous blood glucose monitoring device during calendar year 2019. We are unable to estimate the time necessary for such approval nor the likelihood of success in that endeavor.
  
  ChromaID and Bio-RFID: Foundational Platform Technologies
  
  Our ChromaID and Bio-RFID technologies provide a platform upon which a myriad of applications can be developed. As platform technologies, they are analogous to a smartphone, upon which an enormous number of previously unforeseen applications have been developed. ChromaID and Bio-RFID technologies are “enabling” technologies that bring the science of electromagnetic energy to low-cost, real-world commercialization opportunities across multiple industries. The technologies are foundational and, as such, the basis upon which the Company believes a significant business can be built.
  
  As with other foundational technologies, a single application may reach across multiple industries. The ChromaID technology can, for example effectively differentiate and identify different brands of clear vodkas that appear identical to the human eye. By extension, this same technology can identify pure water from water with contaminants present. It can provide real time detection of liquid medicines such as morphine that have been adulterated or compromised. It can detect if jet fuel has water contamination present. It could determine when it is time to change oil in a deep fat fryer. These are but a few of the potential applications of the ChromaID technology based upon extensions of its ability to identify different clear liquids.

  Similarly, the Bio-RFID technology can non-invasively identity the presence and quantity of glucose in the human body. By extension, there may be other molecular structures which this same technology can identity in the human body which, over time, the Company will focus upon. They may include the monitoring of drug usage or the presence of illicit drugs. They may also involve identifying hormones and various markers of disease.
  
  The cornerstone of a company with a foundational platform technology is its intellectual property. We have pursued an active intellectual property strategy and have been granted 12 patents. We currently have 20 patents pending. We possess all right, title and interest to the issued patents. Ten of the pending patents are licensed exclusively to us in perpetuity by our strategic partner, Allied Inventors.
  
  Our Patents and Intellectual Property.
  
  We believe that our 12 patents, 20 patent applications, three registered trademarks, and our trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets. Our issued patents will expire at various times between 2027 and 2033. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
  
  The issued patents cover the fundamental aspects of the Know Labs ChromaID technology and a growing number of unique applications ranging, to date, from invisible bar codes to tissue and liquid analysis. We have filed patents on Bio-RFID technology and will continue to expand the Company’s patent portfolio over time through internal development efforts as well as through licensing opportunities with third parties.
  
  Additionally, significant aspects of our technology are trade secrets which may not be disclosed through the patent filing process. We intend to be diligent in maintaining our trade secrets.
