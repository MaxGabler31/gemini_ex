Item 1. Business.
General
 
Discovery Energy Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on May 24, 2006 under the name “Santos Resource Corp”. The current business of the Company is the exploration and development of the 584,651 gross acres (914 sq. miles) area in South Australia (“Prospect”) held under Petroleum Exploration License PEL 512 (“License”). In May 2012, the Company incorporated a wholly owned Australian subsidiary, Discovery Energy SA Ltd. (“Subsidiary”), for the purpose of acquiring a 100% working interest in the License. In May 2016, the Subsidiary’s legal entity status changed from public to private and its name changed to Discovery Energy SA Pty Ltd. The Company is in the initial exploration phase of determining whether or not the Prospect contains economically recoverable volumes of crude oil, natural gas and/or natural gas liquid (collectively “Hydrocarbons”). Although the Company’s current focus is primarily on the Prospect, management from time-to-time exchanges information with other industry participants regarding additional investment opportunities in Australia.
 
To date, the Company has achieved the following milestones:
 

* | On October 26, 2012, the License was granted to the Subsidiary. After the License grant, the Company’s primary focus was on completing a financing to raise sufficient funds so that the Company could undertake a required proprietary seismic acquisition program. After exploring a number of possible financings, the precipitous decline in crude oil prices starting in the summer of 2014 delayed the Company’s ability to successfully complete a financing of the type being sought.

* | In May 2016, the Company completed its first closing under a financing arrangement pursuant to which the Company issued to two investors Senior Secured Convertible Debentures due May 27, 2021 (each a “Debenture” and collectively the “Debentures”). To date, the Company has issued a total of 14 Debentures having an aggregate original principal amount of $6,850,000. The Debentures are due and payable on or before May 27, 2021. Interest on the Debentures to date has been accrued and added to principal, thereby increasing the outstanding balance on the Debentures to approximately $8,276,158 as of the date of this Report. Interest will be accrued until such time as the Debentures are repaid or converted. Among other uses, the proceeds from the Debentures enabled the Company to undertake required seismic work. In conjunction with certain issuances of Debentures, warrants (“Warrants”) were issued that give the holder the right to purchase up to a maximum of 19,125,000 common shares at an initial per-share exercise price of $0.20. For more information about the Debentures and the Warrants, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing History and Immediate, Short-Term Capital Needs - Debenture Financing” below. 
* | On October 30, 2016, fieldwork was completed on the Company’s proprietary Nike 3D seismic survey (the “Survey”) covering an approximately 69 sq. mile (179 sq. km.) section of the southwest portion of the Prospect. The Survey was completed at a “turnkey price” of approximately $2,379,000.

* | The raw data from the Survey was converted to analytical quality information, processed and interpreted by the Company’s geophysical advisor. Interpretation of the processed data included advanced technical analysis by specialized consultants. This technical work identified an inventory of more than 30 leads judged to be potential areas of crude oil accumulations. The Company has prioritized these initial prospective locations for presentations to potential sources of significant capital. Technical analysis is on-going. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* | In June 2017, the Company completed the archeological and environmental field surveys of seven prospective drilling locations as required by applicable laws and regulations. It subsequently filed reports on these surveys with the South Australian government; no material issues were identified at any of the prospective drilling sites. 
* | In addition to the amounts raised pursuant to the Debentures arrangements, since the Company adopted its current business plan, the Company has raised funds totaling $3,853,750 through private placements of the Company’s common shares. 
* | In several transactions to date, the Company (through the Subsidiary) has purchased portions of an original 7.0% royalty interest relating to the Prospect retained by the party that, in effect, transferred and sold the License to the Company. As a result, the Company (through the Subsidiary) now owns an aggregate 5.0% royalty interest, while the previous holder of the original 7.0% royalty interest continues to hold a 2.0% royalty interest. The aggregate purchase price for the aggregate 5.0% royalty interest was $540,500. 

 
While reviewing the following description of the Company’s business, note that the Company has conducted (or conducted work on) several different surveys of different types. When the capitalized term “Survey” is used, this term refers to the approximately $2,379,000 Nike 3D seismic survey (covering an approximately 69 sq. mile (179 sq. km.) section of the southwest portion of the Prospect described above. This Survey is discussed above, and is the most costly survey work completed by the Company. As discussed below, the Company has also undertaken the reprocessing and reinterpretation of a 3D seismic survey conducted over the Lake Hope area of the Prospect. As also discussed below, the Company has also undertaken some “work area clearance” (“WAC”) surveys.


Prospect
 
The Prospect is located in the “Western Flank” area, which is the southwest edge of the Cooper and Eromanga Basins, the most prolific producing onshore region in Australia. There are three separate acreage blocks in the Prospect: West (~400,000 acres), South (~181,000 acres) and Lycium (~4,000 acres).
 
There are producing wells on trend and directly north and east of the Company’s South block. A typical Namur well, a primary producing reservoir in the Western Flank, is drilled to a depth of approximately 5,500 feet. The wellbore is vertical or near vertical and there is no lateral drilling or hydraulic stimulation required. This high-permeability reservoir combined with a strong aquifer system produces very high flow and recovery rates. Initial production rates typically range from approximately 450 to 940 barrels of oil per day (“BOPD”). The produced oil is light sweet and high gravity (45 degrees) which is expected to result in premium pricing. As described in the section captioned “Markets and Marketing” below, markets for the Company’s production are readily accessible via existing infrastructure.
 
Beginning in 2018, Beach Energy began implementing horizontal drilling techniques targeting the lower permeability McKinlay and Birkhead reservoirs in the Western Flank. Several wells with approximately 2,000-foot lateral sections were successfully drilled and completed. Initial production rates ranged from 800 to 2,000 BOPD resulting in an average well productivity improvement of 8.2 times over vertical wells for 1.5 times the cost. Typically, the time and cost to drill a well decreases and production rates and economics improve as additional wells are drilled and the increase in knowledge and experience is incorporated into best practices.
 
Exploration Activity
 
Over the course of the last seven years, the Company has assembled a database that now includes a substantial inventory of data, analyses and technical information on the Cooper and Eromanga Basins, fields in the Western Flank, operators and operations, all in close proximity to the Prospect. In 2012, an engineering consultant was engaged to prepare an NI 51-101 compliant report which resulted in the identification of more than 110 seismic generated leads over approximately 30% of the Prospect. This was complimented by the reinterpretation of approximately 3,200 miles (5,153 km.) of 2D seismic data and the reprocessing and reinterpretation of approximately 55 sq. miles (141 sq. km.) of 3D seismic data from a survey conducted over the Lake Hope area in the eastern portion of the South block. In late 2016, the Company conducted the approximately $2.379 million Nike 3D seismic survey  covering an area of approximately 69 sq. miles (179 sq. km.) located in the western section of the South block and directly on trend and in close proximity to mature producing oil fields and recent discoveries on blocks to the north.

Terms of the License
 
In 2012, the Subsidiary received a formal grant of the License from the South Australian Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy. The License is a “Petroleum Exploration License” (a “PEL”) granting the right to explore for all regulated resources (including petroleum and any other substance that naturally occurs in association with petroleum) relating to the Prospect, provided, however, that the License does not permit use of the Prospect as a source of geothermal energy or a natural reservoir for the purpose of gas storage.
 
The Company now holds a 100% working interest in the License, subject to overriding royalty interests aggregating to 18%, with the following persons holding the interests indicated:
 

Royalty Holder | Percentage Royalty Interest | 
------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+----
State of South Australia | | 10%
Native Title Holders as defined below | | 1% 
The Subsidiary | | 5% 
Liberty Petroleum Corp. (“Liberty”) | | 2% 
Total | | 18%

 
The License was originally to be issued to Liberty, which (for consideration) assigned to the Company the right to be issued the License in its place. Liberty originally held a 7% overriding royalty interest, but (for consideration) assigned to the Subsidiary a 5% overriding royalty interest. In view of the preceding, the Company holds an 82% net revenue interest in the License, in addition to the 5% overriding royalty interest held by the Subsidiary.
 
The License is subject to a five-year work commitment as described below. Failure to comply with the work program requirements could lead to the cancellation of the License.
 
Throughout the term of the License, the Company is obligated to make production royalty payments to the State of South Australia in amounts equal to 10% of the value at the wellhead of Hydrocarbons produced and sold from the lands covered by the License. This is the 10% overriding royalty interest indicated in the table above. The License also requires that insurance of the types and amounts of coverage that management believes are reasonable, customary and the industry standard be maintained. The License contains provisions regarding environmental matters and liabilities that management believes are reasonable, customary and the industry standard.
 
The initial term of the License is five years, with two five-year renewal terms, subject to the provisions of the South Australian Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act 2000. At the end of the initial five-year term of the License and assuming that the Company has met its obligations under the License, the License can be renewed for a first five-year renewal term, provided, however, that the Company must relinquish one-third of its acreage or convert all or portions of it to a Petroleum Retention License (a “PRL”). At the end of the first five-year renewal term of the License and assuming that the Company has met its obligations under the License, the License can be renewed for a second five-year renewal term, provided, however, that the Company must relinquish one-third of its original acreage or convert all or portions of the remaining acreage to a PRL. Relevant law requires the South Australian government to grant a PEL with respect to any acreage to be relinquished if the related licensee submits a reasonable application for renewal of the related license. Management believes that (as a matter of practice) the South Australian government almost invariably grants renewals, although the Company has no assurance that this will occur in its case. Any renewal could entail additional requirements, such as an additional work commitment. Control over acreage can remain in effect indefinitely, so long as the licensee converts its license to a Petroleum Production License” (a “PPL”) and is producing Hydrocarbons from the related acreage. A PPL has requirements similar to but somewhat different from a PEL, and the scope of the acreage in effect “held by production” is limited by applicable law.
 
As a precondition to the issuance of the License, the Subsidiary entered into two agreements (the “Native Title Agreements”) with (a) the State of South Australia, (b) Aboriginal native titleholders and claimants (the “Native Title Holders”), and (c) associations acting on behalf of the Native Title Holders (the “Associations”). The Native Title Holders have certain historic rights on the lands covered by the License. The Native Title Agreements are in effect co-terminus with the License. In consideration of the Native Title Holders’ entering into the Native Title Agreements, the Subsidiary remitted to them a one-time payment in the amount of approximately US$80,377. Moreover, throughout the term of the License, the Subsidiary is obligated to pay to the State of South Australia for the benefit of the Native Title Holders production royalty payments in amounts equal to 1% of the value at the wellhead of petroleum produced and sold from the lands covered by the License. This is the 1% overriding royalty interest indicated in the table above. Furthermore, for facilitating the administration of this Native Title Agreements, the Subsidiary will pay in advance to the Associations an annual fee not expected to exceed $15,000 based on current currency exchange rates. The Native Title Agreements feature extensive provisions governing aboriginal heritage protection in connection with the Subsidiary’s activities relating to the License. Management believes that these provisions (as well as the other provisions of the Native Title Agreements) are reasonable, customary and the industry standard throughout Australia. However, the provisions governing aboriginal heritage protection could adversely affect operational strategy and could increase costs. For example, the Company conducted WAC surveys in connection with the 3D Seismic Survey in 2016 and in connection with the Company’s first seven targeted drilling locations which were cleared in 2017. The costs of these surveys were (respectively) approximately $139,000 and $46,000, with the latter figure being smaller in part as some of the costs of this survey were shared with two other companies.

Plan of Operation
 
Current Status
 
The Company is in the initial phase of its Plan of Operation. To date, field operations have been limited to the successful completion of seismic and related WAC surveys. Without drilling results, the Company does not have the necessary technical data to prepare estimates of Hydrocarbons reserves needed to prepare various reports for submission to regulators. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will find commercially producible volumes of Hydrocarbons.
Current Primary Activities
 
The Company’s current primary activity is to complete either a major financing or a major joint venture relationship, or both, so that it can execute the remaining work commitment as described below, and develop the Prospect.
 
The License is subject to a five-year work commitment, which imposes certain financial obligations on the Company. In management’s view, the geotechnical work completed in Years 1 and 2 of the commitment was sufficient to satisfy the License requirements for those two years. Required reports in connection with these activities were timely filed. To date, no comments from the government have been received, and management understands that the related government agency is required by law to furnish comments within 30 days after the reports are filed. Moreover, such agency as extended and modified the work commitment a number of times since the filing of the reports, and has been very accommodating with the Company’s requests to it.
 
Over the last several years, a number of extensions and modifications of the work commitment have been granted. The current remaining work commitment is as follows:
 

* | Year 3 ending October 28, 2019 - Shoot 2D seismic data totaling at least approximately 62 miles (100 km.) and shoot 3D seismic data totaling at a minimum approximately 77 sq. miles (200 sq. km.) and drill two wells. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* | Year 4 ending October 28, 2020 - Shoot 3D seismic data totaling at a minimum approximately 77 sq. miles (200 sq. km.) and drill two wells. 
* | Year 5 ending October 28, 2021 - Drill three wells. 

 
The Company needs a significant amount of capital to fulfill its obligations under the work commitment. Moreover, the Debentures mature in May 2021, and the Company will need to raise additional funds or generate sufficient revenues through Hydrocarbon production to timely repay the Debentures. The Company’s capital requirements and financing activities are described in the section captioned “Liquidity and Capital Requirements” below. The success of the initial phase of the Plan of Operation depends upon the Company’s ability to obtain additional capital or enter into a suitable joint venture arrangement in order to acquire additional seismic data and successfully drill commitment wells. Failure to obtain required additional capital or enter into a suitable joint venture arrangement will materially and adversely affect the Company and its stockholders in ways that are discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Consequences of a Financing Failure” below. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will obtain the necessary capital and/or enter into a suitable joint venture agreement.

Once the Company is in a position to commence drilling, it intends to engage the services of a third-party contractor. No significant impediments to procuring the services of one or more qualified contract operators and drillers in connection with the initial phase of the Company’s Plan of Operation are anticipated. However, a considerable increase in drilling activity in the West Flank area could result in longer wait times and higher costs to obtain materials and services. The contract operator will be responsible for all regulatory compliance matters; hiring the drilling contractor, geologist and petroleum engineer to make final decisions relative to the zones to be targeted; well design; drilling and logging. Should wells comprising the Company’s drilling operations be successful, the operator will then be responsible for completion operations, production facilities procurement, installation, operations and maintenance, interconnecting with gathering or transmission pipelines and attending to various administrative matters.
 
The Company initially plans on focusing on oil-bearing formations, and thus crude oil is most likely to be the Company’s principal product for the foreseeable future, if the Company is successful in its exploration and production activities. Natural gas is not expected to be a big factor for the foreseeable future. The Company expects that most of crude oil produced will be transported through trucking operations. For reasons discussed in the following section, the Company is confident that it will be able to sell and transport its crude oil productions.
 
Any natural gas produced may (depending on the amount produced) be flared or transported through gathering systems and gas pipelines that are owned by others. Transportation capacity on gas gathering systems and pipelines is occasionally limited and at times unavailable due to repairs or improvements being made to the facilities or due to use by other gas shippers with priority transportation agreements or who own or control the relevant pipeline. The Company cannot accurately predict the costs of transporting its natural gas production until it drills, completes and tests its initial successful wells. The cost of installing infrastructure to deliver the Company’s natural gas production to Moomba, which, as described below, is the principal transportation center for the area, or elsewhere will vary depending upon distance traversed, negotiated handling/treating fees, pipeline tariffs and other associated costs. Although issues pertaining to the Company’s natural gas transportation could adversely affect the Company, the Company does not believe that this will be the case due to the minor role that any natural gas production is expected to play in the Company’s business.
 
Markets and Marketing
 
The petroleum industry has been characterized historically by Hydrocarbon commodity prices that fluctuate (sometimes dramatically), and supplier costs can rise significantly during industry booms. The most recent price decline cycle started in June 2014 when the price of Brent oil was above $110 per barrel and declined to a low of $29 per barrel in January 2016. Since then, prices have steadily recovered with the average Brent closing price during April 2019 exceeding $70 per barrel. Hydrocarbon prices and markets are likely to remain volatile. Sales prices for these commodities are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors beyond the Company’s control. These factors include:

* | international political conditions (including embargoes, wars and civil unrest, such as the recent unrest in the Middle East); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* | the domestic and foreign supply of Hydrocarbons; 
* | consumer demand; 
* | weather conditions; 
* | domestic and foreign governmental regulations and other actions; 
* | actions taken by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”); 
* | technological advances affecting energy consumption; 
* | technology and knowledge advances’ impact seismic, drilling, development and production; 
* | the price and availability of alternative fuels; and 
* | overall economic conditions.

Decreases in Hydrocarbon prices might not only decrease the Company’s future revenues on a per unit basis, but could also reduce the volumes that the Company could produce economically. A sustained decline in sales prices could materially affect the Company’s future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and borrowing capacity, and may require a reduction in the carrying value of the Company’s assets. While the Company’s future revenues may increase if prevailing prices increase significantly, exploration and production costs and acquisition costs for additional properties and reserves may also increase. The Company might enter into hedging arrangements or use derivative financial instruments to hedge in whole or in part the risk associated with fluctuations in commodity prices.
 
The Company does not expect to refine any of its production, although it may need to treat or process some of its production to meet the quality standards of purchasing or transportation companies. Therefore, the Company expects that all or nearly all of its production will be sold to a relatively small number of customers. Production from the Company’s properties will be marketed in a manner consistent with industry practices. The Company does not currently have any long-term sales contracts for its future production, but it expects that it will generally sell any production that it develops pursuant to these types of contracts. The Company does not believe that it will have any difficulty in entering into long-term sales contracts for its production, although there can be no assurance in this regard.
 
The principal crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids transportation hub for the Western Flank is located in the vicinity of Moomba. This processing and transportation center is approximately 60 km (37 miles) due east of the Prospect’s easternmost boundary and about 40 miles from the Company’s expected initial drill sites. These sites are located about 20 miles from a privately-owned terminal for trucking oil in Lycium. The Lycium Hub is also the terminal point for a main Trunk Line with 20,000 barrels per day capacity, which delivers oil to the Moomba Processing Facility. If the Company is unable to enter into a suitable contractual relationship with the owner of the truck terminal in Lycium, the Company would be required to sell its crude oil production to a regional carrier that is required to purchase the Company’s produced crude oil and transport it by truck to Moomba, where the pipeline system is managed by such regional carrier must transport the Company’s produced crude oil to market. Large diameter pipelines deliver oil and gas liquids from Moomba south to Port Bonython (Whyalla). Natural gas is also moved south to Adelaide or east to Sydney. A gas transmission pipeline connects Moomba to Ballera, which is located northeastward in the State of Queensland. From Ballera, natural gas can be moved to Brisbane and Gladstone, where a liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) project is under development. The Moomba treating and transportation facilities and the southward pipelines were developed and are operated by a producer consortium led by Santos Limited.
 
The availability of a ready market for the Company’s production will depend upon a number of factors beyond the Company’s control, including the availability of other production in the Prospect’s region, the proximity and capacity of Hydrocarbon pipelines, and fluctuations in supply and demand. Although the effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted or anticipated, the Company does not anticipate any unusual difficulty in contracting to sell its production of Hydrocarbons to purchasers at prevailing market prices and under arrangements that are usual and customary in the industry. However, there can be no assurance that market, economic and regulatory factors will not in the future materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell its production.
 
Sales prices for Hydrocarbon production are negotiated based on factors normally considered in the industry, such as the reported trading prices for Hydrocarbons on local or international commodity exchanges, distance from wells to pipelines, well pressure, estimated reserves, commodity quality and prevailing supply conditions. Historically, Hydrocarbon sales prices have experienced high volatility resulting from changing perceptions throughout the industry centered on supply and demand. The Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect sales prices or the degree to which such prices will be affected. However, sales prices realized by the Company should be equivalent to current market prices in the geographic region of the Prospect. Typically, crude oil prices in Australia reflect or are “benchmarked” against European commodity market trading settlement prices, mainly Brent Crude. Recent price levels in this market have been at a premium to those settled in the United States, or (in other words) those “benchmarked” against West Texas Intermediate Crude. During certain periods, the differential has been substantial.

The Company will strive to obtain the best sales prices in the area of its production. The Company’s revenues, profitability and future growth will depend substantially on prevailing prices. Decreases in the sales prices would likely adversely affect the carrying value of any proved reserves the Company is successful in establishing and its prospects, revenues, profitability and cash flow.
 
Competition
 
The Company expects to operate in the highly competitive areas of Hydrocarbon exploration, development and production. The Company believes that the level of competition in these areas will continue and may even intensify. In the areas of Hydrocarbon exploration, development and production, competitive advantage is gained through superior capital investment decisions, technological innovation and cost management. The Company’s competitors include major firms and a large number of independent companies. Because the Company expects to have control over acreage sufficient for its exploration and production efforts for the foreseeable future, the Company does not expect to compete for the acquisitions of properties for the exploration for Hydrocarbons. However, the Company will compete for the equipment, services and labor required to explore for, develop and produce its properties and to transport its production. Many of the Company’s competitors have substantially larger operating staffs and greater financial and other resources. In addition, larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulations more easily than the Company can, which would adversely affect its competitive position. Moreover, most of the Company’s competitors have been operating in the Western Flank for longer periods than the Company has and they have demonstrated the ability to operate through a number of industry cycles. The effect of this intense competition cannot now be determined.
Regulation
 
The Company’s operations in South Australia and within the Western Flank are subject to the laws and regulations of the State of South Australia and the Commonwealth of Australia. The License was granted under the Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act 2000 (SA) and the Company’s operations within and with respect to the License are governed by this Act and by the Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Regulations 2013 (SA). This legislation covers all phases of the Company’s operations including exploration, appraisal, development and production of Hydrocarbons from the License area. Other legislation which the Company will be required to comply with at various stages of its operations include: Environment Protection Act 1993 (SA); Aboriginal Heritage Act 1988 (SA); Native Title (South Australia) Act 1994 (SA) and Native Title Act 1993 (Cth). As its Hydrocarbon exploration and production operations in South Australia proceed, the Company will provide more detailed information regarding the material features and effects of these laws and regulations and such other legislation with which the Company will be required to comply.
Employees
 
As of the date of this Report, the Company had no employees and has not had employees in the past. However, the Company has used a number of consultants and part-time service providers in the past, including members of the Company’s management. The Company expects that it will not have employees for the foreseeable future, although it expects to continue to use consultants and part-time service providers, and may at some time in the future enter into consulting agreements with additional members of management and staff with whom the Company now has or in the past had consulting arrangements. The market for qualified industry professionals and craftsmen can be very competitive during periods of strong commodity prices. The Company anticipates offering compensation and an interesting work environment that will enable it to attract employees to meet the Company’s labor needs, once fully funded.

Discovery Energy Corp.
 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
1. Nature of Operations
 
The principal business of Discovery Energy Corp. (“Company”) is the exploration and development of the 584,651 gross acres (“Prospect”) in South Australia covered by Petroleum Exploration License PEL 512 (“License”). In May 2012, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Discovery Energy SA Ltd., for the purpose of acquiring a 100% working interest in the License. On May 25, 2016, its status changed from a public to a private legal entity and its name to Discovery Energy SA Pty Ltd. (“Subsidiary”). To date, the Company has not determined whether or not the Prospect, which overlies portions of the Cooper and Eromanga basins, contains any crude oil and/or natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. While the Company’s present focus is on the Prospect, it may consider pursuing other attractive crude oil and/or natural gas exploration opportunities.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Principles of Consolidation
 
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the Subsidiary. Inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of these financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in bank accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits as guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At February 28, 2019, approximately $156,000 of the Company’s cash balances were uninsured. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts.
Oil and Gas Property and Exploration Costs
 
The Company is in the exploration stage of evaluating the Prospect and has not yet realized any revenues from its operations. It applies the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, exploration costs such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals and exploratory overhead are expensed as incurred. Costs to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and/or natural gas properties, drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and drill and equip development wells are capitalized. Acquisition costs of unproved leaseholds are assessed for impairment during the holding period and transferred to proven crude oil and/or natural gas properties to the extent associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment, based on the Company’s current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. Capitalized costs from successful exploration and development activities associated with producing crude oil and/or natural gas leases, along with capitalized costs for support equipment and facilities, are amortized to expense using the unit-of-production method based on proved crude oil and/or natural gas reserves on a field-by-field basis, as estimated by qualified petroleum engineers.

F-7
---

Long-lived Assets
 
The carrying values of long-lived assets are reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Derivative Financial Instruments
 
The carrying amounts of cash, receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and shareholder loans approximate their fair values due to the short maturity of these items. Certain fair value estimates may be subject to and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, nor does it utilize derivative instruments in the management of its foreign exchange, commodity price, and/or interest rate market risks.
Income Taxes
 
Deferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in these financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes. The Company uses the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax loss and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards when realization is not more likely than not.
 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The law includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a federal corporate rate reduction from 34% to 21%. In accordance with ASC 740, the impact of a change in the tax law is recorded in the period of enactment.
 
The Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions by recognizing in the financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on examination by taxation authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
 
Foreign Currency Translation
 
The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets are translated at historical exchange rates, and revenue and expense items at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Differences resulting from translation are presented in equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses arising on settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. Foreign currency transactions are primarily undertaken in Canadian and Australian dollars. The Company has not, to the date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
Fair Value Considerations
 
Historically, the Company followed Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” as amended by FASB Financial Staff Position (“FSP”) No. 157 and related guidance. These provisions relate to the Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and the fair value disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, expands related disclosure requirements, and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of the inputs used to develop the fair value measures. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, assuming the transaction occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.

F-8
---


There are three levels of inputs to fair value measurements - Level 1, meaning the use of quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, meaning the use of quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or are directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, meaning the use of unobservable inputs. The Company uses Level 1 inputs for its fair value measurements whenever there is an active market, with actual quotes, market prices, and observable inputs on the measurement date. The Company uses Level 2 inputs for fair value measurements whenever there are quoted prices for similar securities in an active market or quoted prices for identical securities in an inactive market. The Company uses observable market data whenever available.
 
In accordance with ASC 815-40-25 and ASC 815-10-15 “Derivatives and Hedging” and ASC 480-10-25 “Liabilities-Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity”, the embedded derivative associated with the convertible note payable and warrant were accounted for as liabilities during the term of the related note payable and warrant as of February 28, 2018.
 
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. These amendments simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features. The amendments require companies to disregard the down round feature when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to its own stock, for purposes of determining liability or equity classification. The guidance was adopted as of March 1, 2018.
 
Loss Per Share
 
Basic Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options and/or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
 
For the years ended February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the following share equivalents related to convertible debt and warrants to purchase shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as the inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive.
 

 | Year Ended | | Year Ended 
--------------------------------+-----------------------+------------+----------------------
Common Shares Issuable for: | February 28, 2019 | | February 28, 2018 
Convertible debt | | 50,042,556 | | 44,509,560
Stock warrants | | 19,125,000 | | 19,125,000
 | | 69,167,556 | | 63,634,560

Comprehensive Income (Loss)
 
The Company recognizes currency translation adjustments as a component of comprehensive income (loss).

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing” (Topic 606). In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)” (Topic 606). These amendments provide additional clarification and implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The amendments in ASU 2016-10 provide clarifying guidance on materiality of performance obligations; evaluating distinct performance obligations; treatment of shipping and handling costs; and determining whether an entity’s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use an entity’s intellectual property or a right to access an entity’s intellectual property. The amendments in ASU 2016-08 clarify how an entity should identify the specified good or service for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. The adoption of ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-08 is to coincide with an entity’s adoption of ASU 2014-09, which would be adopted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company has evaluated the adoption of the standard and, due to the nature of the Company’s oil and gas revenue agreements, there was no impact from the adoption of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.
 
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (“ASU 2016-15”). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements.
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, a new lease standard requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for most leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company will be required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. The Company has evaluated the adoption of the standard and, due to only one operating lease currently in place, there will be minimal impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.
 
In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, the Company has addressed the going concern issue in Note 3.
 
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. These amendments simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features. The amendments require companies to disregard the down round feature when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to its own stock, for purposes of determining liability or equity classification. The Company adopted the guidance as of March 1, 2018.
 
The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a significant impact on its financial statements.

3. Going Concern
 
These financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated revenues since inception, and is unlikely to generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity or debt financing to continue operations, successfully develop the Prospect and/or obtain producing properties, with a goal of attaining profitable operations. The Company is currently attempting to complete a significant financing, and in this connection might (a) place a significant amount of additional Debentures similar to those described below, (b) secure an alternative financing arrangement, possibly involving the Company’s equity securities, or (c) some combination of (a) and (b). The Company has no assurance that it will be able to raise significant additional funds to develop the Prospect or the additional funds needed for general corporate purposes.
 
As of February 28, 2019, the Company had not generated any revenues and had an accumulated loss of $19,674,892 since inception. These factors raise substantial doubts regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Additional convertible debenture sales and common stock sales completed during the years ended February 28, 2018 and 2019 are as follows:

4. Oil and Gas Properties
 
The License covers 584,651 gross acres in the State of South Australia. The License grants a 100% working interest in the preceding acreage, which overlies portions of the Cooper and Eromanga basins.
 
On October 26, 2012, a 100% interest in the License was officially issued to the Subsidiary.
 
On May 19, 2014, the Company received notice from the Government of South Australia that it had issued certain modifications to the License and had suspended the License for a period of six months. Such a suspension functions like an extension. Subsequent to this modification and suspension, the Company received two additional six-month suspensions, one in February 2015 and one in July 2015 (this additional suspension commenced upon the conclusion of the suspension received in February 2015). In February 2016, the Company received a third additional suspension, which was for one year and which commenced upon the conclusion of the suspension received in July 2015. Combined, these three additional suspensions amount to an accumulated total suspension of two years.


On June 22, 2016, the Company terminated the February 2016 License suspension in preparation for a 3D seismic survey (the “Survey”) that was comprised of approximately 69 sq. miles (179 sq. km.) on the southwest portion of the Prospect. After archaeological and environmental reviews of the survey area, fieldwork by the seismic contractor began on July 26, 2016. The Survey and field work were completed on October 30, 2016 and the License was suspended again on November 1, 2016.
 
In July 2017, the License suspension was lifted in order to conduct a Work Area Clearance Survey (“WAC”) of several potential drill sites located in the southern portion of the License. After completing the Survey, the Company requested and received three additional six-month suspensions, one in July 2017, one in June 2018 and one in February 2019 resulting in a new expiration date of October 28, 2021.
 
As a result of the activities, modifications and suspensions described above, the remaining work commitments are now as follows:
 

* | Year 3 ending October 28, 2019 - Acquire additional 2D seismic data totaling at least 62 miles (100 km.) and acquire 3D seismic data totaling at least 77 sq. miles (200 sq. km.), and drill two wells. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* | Year 4 ending October 28, 2020 - Acquire additional 3D seismic data totaling at least 77 sq. miles (200 sq. km.) and drill two wells. 
* | Year 5 ending October 28, 2021 - Drill three wells. 

 
In four transactions, the Company acquired portions of the royalty interest associated with the PEL 512 License so that the Company now owns an aggregate 5.0% royalty interest, while the previous holders of the original 7.0% royalty interest continue to hold a 2.0% royalty interest.

5. Related Party Transactions
 
As of February 28, 2019 and 2018, the Company owed $149,190 and $30,476, respectively, to certain Company directors for reimbursement of expenses paid on behalf of the Company.
 
On November 1, 2017, but effective as of March 1, 2017, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Keith Spickelmier, the Company’s Chairman of the Board, to provide certain consulting services to the Company. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company paid a consulting fee for fiscal year 2018 of $125,000 and prepaid $50,000 against the Company’s obligation of the $125,000 fee due in fiscal 2019. The remaining $75,000 balance was paid in fiscal 2019.
 
During fiscal 2019, the Company entered into an informal verbal consulting agreement with an affiliated entity owned by Keith McKenzie, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. Initially, varying amounts of consulting fees were paid depending on the type and amount of services provided. Since September 2018, a set monthly fee of $5,000 has been paid.
 
On January 8, 2019, the Company paid bonuses to the Chairman of the Board and the officers as follows:
 

Keith Spickelmier, Chairman of the Board | $ | 30,000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------
Keith McKenzie, Chief Executive Officer | $ | 5,000 
William Begley, President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer | $ | 15,000
Sean Austin, Treasurer and Secretary | $ | 5,000 

6. Convertible Debentures Payable
 
From May 27, 2016 through February 28, 2019, the Company issued nine rounds (I thru XI) of senior secured convertible debentures, the proceeds of which have funded the initial 3D seismic survey with respect to the Prospect, the interpretation of seismic data acquired, expenses associated with the seismic survey, costs associated with the debenture issuances, and general and administrative expenses. The debentures are secured by virtually all of the Company’s assets owned, directly or indirectly, but for the License. As discussed elsewhere, the Company may in the future sell additional senior secured convertible debentures having the same terms as those currently outstanding.

7. Derivative Liabilities
 
Historically, the Company accounted for certain instruments as derivative instruments in accordance with FASB ASC 815-40, Derivative and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity. This was due to the debentures and related warrants issued by the Company containing a price-reset provision. . The Company measured its derivative liability at fair value and recognized the derivative value as a current liability and recorded the derivative value on its consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the fair values of the derivative were recognized as earnings or losses in the current period in other income (expenses) on the consolidated statement of operations and other comprehensive income (loss). The Company recorded a loss on the change in the estimate fair value of the debentures and warrants of $5,614,689 for the year ended February 28, 2018.
 
As of March 1, 2018, the Company early adopted ASU 2017-11, which revised the guidance for instruments with price-reset provisions. As such, the Company treats outstanding warrants as free-standing equity-linked instruments that are recorded to equity in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 1, 2018.
 
The impact of the adoption was as follows:
 

Derivative liabilities | $ | (16,172,119 | )
--------------------------------+---+-------------+--
Additional paid-in capital | | 12,544,607 | 
Accumulated deficit | | 3,627,512 | 
Total stockholders’ deficit | $ | 16,172,119 |

8. Income Taxes
 
On December 22, 2017, new federal tax reform legislation was enacted in the United States (the “2017 Tax Act”), resulting in significant changes from previous tax law. The 2017 Tax Act reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 34% effective January 1, 2018. The rate change, along with certain immaterial changes in tax basis resulting from the 2017 Tax Act, resulted in a reduction of the Company’s deferred tax assets of $31,406 and a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance. The following table reconciles the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate in effect for the years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, and the Company’s effective tax rate:

 | Year Ended February 28, 2019 | | | Year Ended February 28, 2018 
--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. federal statutory income tax | | (745,430 | ) | | (2,870,964 | )
Meals & Entertainment | | 18,958 | | | 6,932 | 
True-up of Prior Year Permanent Items | | 7,140 | | | - | 
FV of Derivative on Issuance | | - | | | 553,462 | 
Change in FV of Derivative | | | | | 1,838,080 | 
Change in the Effective Rates | | | | | 31,046 | 
Change in Valuation Allowance | | 719,332 | | | 441,084 | 
Effective income tax rate | | - | | | - | 

 
The significant components of deferred income tax assets and (liabilities) at February 28, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:
 

 | February 28, 2019 | | | February 28, 2018 | 
-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-----------+---+-------------------+--
Capitalized Geological/Geophysical & Other Intangibles | $ | 56,956 | | | $ | 77,332 | 
Debt Discount & Related Amortization | | (454,481 | ) | | | (801,622 | )
Federal Net Operating Loss | | 1,174,730 | | | | 782,163 | 
Less: Valuation Allowance | | (777,205 | ) | | | (57,873 | )
Net Deferred Tax Asset | $ | - | | | $ | - | 

 
The amount taken into income as deferred income tax assets must reflect that portion that is more likely-than-not to be realized from future operations. The Company has chosen to provide a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. The Company has recognized a valuation allowance for the net deferred income tax asset since the Company cannot be assured that it is more likely than not that such benefit will be utilized in future years. The valuation allowance is reviewed annually. When circumstances change and which cause a change in management’s judgment about the realize-ability of deferred income tax assets, the impact of the change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in current income.
 
Management has considered the likelihood and significance of possible penalties associated with its current and intended filing positions and has determined, based on their assessment, that such penalties, if any, would not be expected to be material.
 
No provision for income taxes has been provided in these financial statements due to the net loss for the years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018. An NOL carryforward of $5,593,951 has accumulated as of February 28, 2019 with portions beginning to expire in 2032.
