ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
We are one of the largest regional amusement park operators in the world with 13 properties in our portfolio consisting of amusement parks, water parks and complementary resort facilities. We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 1987 and managed by Cedar Fair Management, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "General Partner"), whose shares are held by an Ohio trust. 
Our parks are family-oriented, with recreational facilities for people of all ages, and provide clean and attractive environments with exciting rides and immersive entertainment. Our parks include: Cedar Point, located on Lake Erie between Cleveland and Toledo in Sandusky, Ohio; Knott's Berry Farm, near Los Angeles, California; Canada's Wonderland, near Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Kings Island, near Cincinnati, Ohio; Carowinds, in Charlotte, North Carolina; Kings Dominion, near Richmond, Virginia; California's Great America, in Santa Clara, California; Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom ("Dorney Park"), in Allentown, Pennsylvania; Worlds of Fun, in Kansas City, Missouri; Valleyfair, near Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota; Michigan's Adventure, in Muskegon, Michigan; Schlitterbahn Waterpark & Resort New Braunfels in New Braunfels, Texas; and Schlitterbahn Waterpark Galveston in Galveston, Texas. With limited exceptions, all rides and attractions at the parks are owned and operated by us. 
Our parks operate seasonally except for Knott's Berry Farm, which is typically open daily on a year-round basis. Our seasonal parks are generally open during weekends beginning in April or May, and then daily from Memorial Day until Labor Day. After Labor Day, our seasonal parks are open during select weekends in September and, in most cases, in the fourth quarter for Halloween and winter events. As a result, a substantial portion of our revenues from these seasonal parks typically are generated during an approximate 130- to 140-day operating season with the major portion concentrated in the third quarter during the peak vacation months of July and August. 
The demographic groups that are most important to our business are families and young people ages 12 through 24. Families are believed to be attracted by a combination of rides, live entertainment and the clean, wholesome atmosphere. Young people are believed to be attracted by the action-packed rides. We conduct active television, radio, newspaper and internet advertising campaigns in our major market areas geared toward these two groups.
IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had a material impact on our business in 2020, had a continuing negative impact in 2021 and may have a longer-term negative effect. Beginning on March 14, 2020, we closed our properties for several months. We ultimately resumed partial operations at 10 of our 13 properties in 2020, operating in accordance with local and state guidelines. Due to soft demand trends upon reopening in 2020, park operating calendars were adjusted for the remainder of 2020, including reduced operating days per week and operating hours within each operating day and earlier closure of certain parks than a typical operating year. We delayed the opening of our U.S. properties for the 2021 operating season until May 2021 and opened our Canadian property in July 2021. Upon opening in 2021, we operated with capacity restrictions, guest reservations, and other operating protocols in place. We removed most capacity restrictions, guest reservation requirements and other protocols at our U.S. properties beginning in July 2021. Canada's Wonderland operated with capacity restrictions, guest reservations, and other operating protocols in place throughout 2021. We adjusted our park operating calendars in 2021 and may continue to adjust future park operating calendars as we respond to changes in guest demand, labor availability and any state and local restrictions. We currently anticipate returning to full park operating calendars for the 2022 operating season at all of our parks. The lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may impact guest demand and labor availability, and it is uncertain the extent to which those effects will impact our operational and financial results. Our future operations are dependent on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. 
Despite a delayed start and various operating restrictions in place for the 2021 operating season, our 2021 operating results exceeded our initial expectations, driven by greater consumer demand resulting in higher attendance and in-park per capita spending. As a result, we made progress towards our goal to reduce outstanding debt obtained in response to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by redeeming $450 million of unsecured senior notes in December 2021. The notes redeemed were previously due in 2024.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL
We believe that annual park attendance is influenced by annual investments in our properties, including new attractions and infrastructure, among other factors. Capital expenditures are planned on a seasonal basis with most expenditures made prior to the beginning of the peak operating season. Capital expenditures made in a calendar year may differ materially from amounts identified with a particular operating season because of timing considerations such as weather conditions, site preparation requirements and availability of ride components, which may result in accelerated or delayed expenditures around calendar year-end. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, some capital expenditures were suspended in 2020 and 2021 in order to maintain flexibility and retain liquidity. The timing and amount of future capital expenditures may differ from typical calendar years depending on the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic.
During the operating season, we carry significant receivables and inventories of food and merchandise, as well as payables and payroll-related accruals. These amounts are typically substantially reduced in non-operating periods. Seasonal working capital needs are typically funded from current operations and revolving credit facilities. Revolving credit facilities are typically established at levels sufficient to accommodate our peak borrowing requirements in April and May as the seasonal parks complete preparations for opening. Revolving credit borrowings are then typically reduced with our positive cash flow during the seasonal operating period.

COMPETITION
We compete for discretionary spending with all aspects of the recreation industry within our primary market areas, including other destination and regional amusement parks. We also compete with other forms of entertainment and recreational activities, including movies, sports events, restaurants and vacation travel. 
The principal competitive factors in the amusement park industry include the uniqueness and perceived quality of the rides and attractions in a particular park, proximity to metropolitan areas, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the park, and the quality and variety of the food and immersive entertainment available. We believe that our parks feature a variety of high quality rides and attractions, restaurants, gift shops and family atmosphere to make them highly competitive with other parks and forms of entertainment.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements, such as those relating to employment practices, environmental requirements, and other regulatory matters. We are subject to extensive federal and state employment laws and regulations, including wage and hour laws and other pay practices and employee record-keeping requirements. We may be required to incur costs to comply with these requirements, and the costs of compliance, investigation, remediation, litigation, and resolution of regulatory matters could be substantial.
We also are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations such as those relating to water resources; discharges to air, water and land; the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and the cleanup of properties affected by regulated materials. Under these laws and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases from current or formerly owned or operated facilities or to mitigate potential environmental risks. Environmental laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the relevant entity knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of regulated materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing with respect to our property. 
Currently, we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements under these laws and regulations. However, such requirements have generally become stricter over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to our properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future.
All rides are inspected daily by both our maintenance and ride operations personnel before being placed into operation for our guests. The parks are also periodically inspected by our insurance carrier and, at all parks except Valleyfair, Worlds of Fun, Schlitterbahn Waterpark New Braunfels, Schlitterbahn Waterpark Galveston and Carowinds' South Carolina rides, by state or county ride-safety inspectors. Valleyfair, Worlds of Fun, Schlitterbahn Waterpark New Braunfels, Schlitterbahn Waterpark Galveston and Carowinds each contract with a third party to inspect our rides pursuant to Minnesota, Missouri, Texas and South Carolina law, respectively, and submit the third-party report to the respective state agency. Additionally, all parks have added ride maintenance and operation inspections completed by third party qualified inspectors to make sure our standards are being maintained.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We employ approximately 4,000 full-time employees, and employed approximately 42,000 seasonal and part-time employees in 2021, many of whom are high school and college students. We house some of our seasonal employees in dormitories owned by us at Cedar Point, Kings Island, Carowinds, Kings Dominion and Valleyfair, or rented by us at Dorney Park, Worlds of Fun, Schlitterbahn Waterpark New Braunfels and Schlitterbahn Waterpark Galveston. Approximately 275 of our employees are represented by labor unions. We believe we maintain good relations with our employees.
Our highest priority continues to be the safety and well-being of our guests and employees. In 2021 and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued safety protocols to protect our employees, including staggering schedules to allow for greater social distancing, increasing hygiene, cleaning and sanitizing procedures, providing incremental personal protective equipment, and enabling employees to work from home where possible and during peaks in local case counts, and restricting business travel. We will continue to monitor the developments of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as federal, state and local guidelines, and update our safety protocols based on the most recent recommendations and requirements.
Our employee guidelines and policies are founded on our cornerstones of safety, service and cleanliness and our core values of integrity, courtesy and inclusiveness. We are committed to equal opportunity employment and prohibit harassment or discrimination of any kind. We have adopted an open door policy to encourage an honest employer-associate relationship, which includes a confidential hotline available to all employees. As part of our commitment to our core values, we created a diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE&I") council and provided DE&I training to our employees in 2021.

We maintain training programs for all new employees, including safety training specific to job responsibilities. We participate in the J-1 Visa program providing cultural and educational exchange opportunities for our associates. We also have partnered with Bowling Green State University to create the Cedar Fair Resort and Attraction Management program, a bachelor's degree program, which is housed in downtown Sandusky, Ohio in a facility jointly owned by the Partnership and a third party developer. The bachelor's degree program prepares students for management careers at Cedar Fair parks or a similar establishment. We encourage a promote-from-within policy.
Our executive compensation program is designed to incentivize our key employees to drive superior results, to give key employees a vested interest in our growth and performance, and to enhance our ability to attract and retain exceptional managerial talent. Our executive compensation program rewards both successful individual performance and the consolidated operating results of the Partnership by directly tying compensation to our performance.
