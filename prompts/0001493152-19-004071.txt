Our Business
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of dietary supplements for inflammatory health and pharmaceuticals for chronic diseases driven by inflammation and oxidative stress. We believe we are well positioned for significant and sustained growth via the development and commercialization of dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals utilizing synthetically manufactured astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and related xanthophyll carotenoids, which support health and longevity by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress at the cellular and mitochondrial level without inhibiting normal function. The safety and efficacy of our products have not been directly evaluated in clinical trials or confirmed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”).
Our Products
 
Our product platform consists of a commercially available dietary supplement, ZanthoSyn®, and pharmaceutical candidates, CDX-101 and CDX-301, which are in pre-clinical development.
 
ZanthoSyn® is marketed as a novel astaxanthin dietary supplement with superior absorption and purity. Astaxanthin is a naturally occurring molecule with safe anti-inflammatory activity that supports joint health, cardiovascular health, metabolic health, liver health, and longevity. The form of astaxanthin utilized in ZanthoSyn® has demonstrated excellent safety in peer-reviewed published studies and is Generally Recognized as Safe (“GRAS”) according to FDA regulations.
 
We sell ZanthoSyn® primarily through wholesale and e-commerce channels. We launched our e-commerce channel in 2016 and began selling to General Nutrition Corporation (“GNC”) stores in 2017. ZanthoSyn® is currently available at over three thousand GNC corporate stores in the United States. ZanthoSyn® has been the top selling product at GNC stores in Hawaii for the past year.
 
We market ZanthoSyn® primarily through a two-pronged approach:
 

● | Physician outreach and education, where ZanthoSyn® is positioned as the first safe, physician friendly, anti-inflammatory for health and longevity, and GNC serves as a convenient and credible distribution channel for physicians recommending ZanthoSyn® 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | GNC store outreach, education, and in-store sales support, building on the ability to utilize ZanthoSyn® as a foundation of health and wellness regimens 

 
Our sales and marketing program was initially launched in Hawaii, where robust physician outreach and education coupled with GNC store outreach, education, and in-store sales support increased consumer awareness and catalyzed strong sales growth. We have also launched this program in major markets on the West Coast and East Coast and expect to extend this program nationally as resources permit. To support these efforts, we have hired additional sales and marketing personnel.
 
In September 2018, we initiated a human clinical trial entitled, Cardiovascular Health Astaxanthin Supplement Evaluation (“CHASE”), targeting cardiovascular inflammatory health. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will evaluate the effect of low-dose and high-dose ZanthoSyn® on cardiovascular health as measured by C-Reactive Protein (“CRP”) levels, over 12 weeks in up to 360 subjects with documented cardiovascular risk factors. The study will also include an optional open label extension through 48 weeks.
 
While the FDA does not require human clinical trials for dietary supplements, we believe that positive results from human clinical trials will help to promote scientific and consumer awareness of astaxanthin’s health and longevity applications.

Synthetic Astaxanthin vs. Natural Astaxanthin
 
We believe synthetic astaxanthin offers significant advantages compared to astaxanthin from microalgae, krill, or other sources:
 

● | Synthetic astaxanthin can be formulated for superior bioavailability; in a human study comparing ZanthoSyn® (our synthetic astaxanthin dietary supplement) to a leading microalgal astaxanthin product, the astaxanthin blood levels following administration of ZanthoSyn® were nearly 3 times higher than the microalgal astaxanthin product at the same dose. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Synthetic astaxanthin has been extensively tested in a wide range of toxicity studies, including acute, subacute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity studies, carcinogenicity studies, genotoxicity studies, and developmental and reproductive toxicity studies; whereas to our knowledge microalgal or other sources of astaxanthin have not undergone the same amount of safety testing in such toxicity studies. 
● | Synthetic astaxanthin is manufactured with superior purity and precision, whereas astaxanthin extracted from microalgae and krill oil is obtained in a complex mixture, which may include many unknown marine byproducts. 
● | Synthetic manufacture of astaxanthin is scalable, whereas we believe the ability to readily scale the production and extraction of astaxanthin from microalgae or other sources will be limited as demand for astaxanthin grows. 
● | Synthetic manufacture of astaxanthin emits fewer greenhouse gases and consumes less energy, raw material, and land than traditional microalgal astaxanthin production. 

Pharmaceutical Development
 
We are developing CDX-101 and CDX-301 for pharmaceutical applications:
 
CDX-101, our astaxanthin pharmaceutical candidate, is being developed for cardiovascular inflammation and dyslipidemia. Pre-clinical and clinical studies with astaxanthin have demonstrated proof-of-concept for the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors including inflammation and triglycerides. We believe that an initial indication of severe hypertriglyceridemia provides an efficient clinical pathway to drug approval for CDX-101. CDX-101 is currently in pre-clinical development, including the planning of IND enabling studies.
 
CDX-301, our zeaxanthin pharmaceutical candidate, is being developed for macular degeneration. Zeaxanthin protects the macula against blue light and oxidative damage. Pre-clinical and clinical studies with zeaxanthin have demonstrated proof-of-concept for the treatment of macular disorders. We believe that an initial indication of Stargardt disease, a juvenile form of macular degeneration, provides an efficient clinical pathway to drug approval for CDX-301. On November 30, 2018, we submitted a request for orphan drug designation to the FDA for zeaxanthin as a treatment of Stargardt disease, and on February 1, 2019, the FDA responded with initial comments to which we expect to respond shortly. CDX-301 is currently in pre-clinical development, including the planning of IND enabling studies.


We have retained Paresh N. Soni, M.D., Ph.D., to guide clinical and regulatory strategy, interact with the FDA, and advise us on a full range of development issues. We have also retained Frederick D. Sancilio, Ph.D., to assist us in our orphan drug development strategy, including identifying initial candidates for orphan drug designation.
 
Our pharmaceutical candidates are currently in pre-clinical development and have not been directly evaluated in clinical trials or approved by the FDA for marketing.

Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, commonly referred to as the “JOBS Act.” We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years from the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined by I Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. We will no longer be an emerging growth company from and after December 31, 2018, although we will continue to be a smaller reporting company.
 
As an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to:
 

● | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (we will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) as long as we are a “smaller reporting company,” which includes issuers that had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of their most recently completed second fiscal quarter); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and 
● | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this provision, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development program is comprised of employees, consultants, including regulatory, scientific, and medical professionals, and third-party collaborators or contract organizations, including academic institutions, contract research organizations, and contract manufacturing organizations. We previously utilized dedicated internal synthetic chemistry, biology, and bioanalytical chemistry laboratories and a research and development staff to conduct discovery stage synthesis of products (with transfer of materials and/or methods for additional process development and/or testing), in vitro testing of products and related components to elucidate the mechanism of action, and analysis of biological samples from internal research and/or contract organizations to detect and quantify levels of products and related components following administration of product in various studies. Our research and development staff has also worked with other professionals to identify, contract and transfer materials and methods, and oversee research and manufacturing by contract organizations. Contract organizations provide us with access to larger scale manufacturing, animal proof-of-concept studies, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity, and analysis that would not otherwise be available to us without significant expense. We anticipate that the majority of our research and development will be conducted by contract organizations with direction and oversight by our current internal research and development personnel.
 
In addition to conducting or overseeing research and development activities, our research and development personnel analyze and interpret other research on astaxanthin, as well as related compounds, competing products, applicable health applications, and industry trends. In the United States National Library of Medicine’s online repository, PubMed.gov, there are more than 1,800 peer-reviewed journal articles that reference astaxanthin in the title or abstract, over 500 of which were published in the last three years, with the vast majority published by organizations and researchers that are not affiliated with us. This type of “open-source” research has served to significantly advance the understanding of astaxanthin, and has also presented our research and development personnel with the critical task of keeping up-to-date on all of the latest research and interpreting and integrating the findings with our research and that of others in order to serve as the preeminent thought leaders on astaxanthin’s mechanism of action and its application in biological systems.
 
Our research and development expenditures totaled $269,077 and $97,479 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These expenditures primarily reflect the cost of product development activities. The compensation of our research and development personnel are included as a component of salaries and wages in the consolidated statements of operations. Our research and development expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 were reclassified to conform to the presentation of expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Government Regulation
 
Most aspects of our business are subject to some degree of government regulation. For some of our products, government regulation is significant and, in general, there appears to be a trend toward more stringent regulation throughout the world, as well as global harmonization of various regulatory requirements. We expect to devote significant time, effort and expense to address the extensive government and regulatory requirements applicable to our business. We believe that we are no more or less adversely affected by existing government regulations than our competitors.
 
FDA Regulation
 
Biopharmaceutical companies must comply with comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and comparable authorities in other countries. While the FDA does not require human clinical trials for dietary supplements, we have conducted and may continue to conduct clinical trials with our dietary supplements to promote scientific and consumer awareness. We may also conduct Phase I, Phase II, and/or Phase III clinical trials with our pharmaceutical candidates.
 
We must obtain regulatory approvals by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries to the extent applicable prior to human clinical testing and marketing of any pharmaceutical and for post-approval clinical studies for additional indications of approved drugs. We anticipate that any pharmaceutical candidate will be subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and pre-market approval procedures by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries to the extent applicable. The extent to which our products are regulated by the FDA will depend upon the types of products we ultimately develop. We are currently evaluating and pursuing various developmental strategies and cannot predict, during this stage of our development, the scope of FDA or other agency regulation to which we or our products will be subject. Various federal statutes and regulations also govern or influence the preclinical and clinical testing, record-keeping, approval, labeling, manufacture, quality, shipping, distribution, storage, marketing and promotion, export, and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals.
 
The steps ordinarily required before a drug product may be marketed in the United States include:
 

● | preclinical studies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical candidate in the desired indication for use; 
● | submission to the FDA of a new drug application (“NDA”), together with payment of a substantial user fee; and 
● | FDA approval of the NDA, including inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility and select sites at which human clinical trials were conducted. 

 
Preclinical studies typically involve laboratory evaluation of pharmaceutical candidate chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical candidate. The results of preclinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to an IND, the IND will become effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA clearance to commence clinical trials, and the FDA’s failure to object to an IND does not guarantee FDA approval of a marketing application.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the test agent to humans under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. In the United States, clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices. In addition, each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board and with the subject’s informed consent. We would be subject to similar regulatory considerations if we conduct clinical trials outside the United States.

The goal of Phase I clinical trials is to establish initial data about safety and tolerability of the pharmaceutical candidate in humans. The investigators seek to evaluate the effects of various dosages and to establish an optimal dosage level and schedule.
 
The goal of Phase II clinical trials is to provide evidence about the desired therapeutic efficacy of the pharmaceutical candidate in limited studies with small numbers of carefully selected subjects. Investigators also gather additional safety data.
 
Phase III clinical trials consist of expanded, large-scale, multi-center studies in the target patient population. This phase further tests the product’s effectiveness, monitors side effects, and, in some cases, compares the product’s effects to a standard treatment, if one is already available. Phase III trials are designed to more rigorously test the efficacy of a pharmaceutical candidate and are normally randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled. Phase III trials are typically monitored by an independent data monitoring committee, or DMC, which periodically reviews data as a trial progresses. A DMC may recommend that a trial be stopped before completion for a number of reasons including safety concerns, patient benefit, or futility.
 
Data obtained from this development program are submitted as part of an NDA to the FDA and possibly to corresponding agencies in other countries for review. The NDA requires agency approval prior to marketing in the relevant country. Extensive regulations define the form, content and methods of gathering, compiling and analyzing the pharmaceutical candidate’s safety and efficacy data.
 
The process of obtaining regulatory approval can be costly, time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays. Regulatory agencies may refuse to approve an application if they believe that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and may also require additional testing for safety and efficacy and/or post-marketing surveillance or other ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. In some instances, regulatory approval may be granted with the condition that confirmatory Phase IV clinical trials are carried out, and if these trials do not confirm the results of previous studies, regulatory approval for marketing may be withdrawn. Moreover, each regulatory approval of a product is limited to specific indications. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may approve only limited label information for the product. The label information describes the indications and methods of use for which the product is authorized, may include Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies and, if overly restrictive, may limit a sponsor’s ability to successfully market the product. Regulatory agencies routinely revise or issue new regulations, which can affect and delay regulatory approval of pharmaceuticals.
 
Furthermore, pharmaceutical manufacturing processes must conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. Manufacturers, including a drug sponsor’s third-party contract manufacturers, must expend time, money and effort in the areas of production, quality control and quality assurance, including compliance with stringent record-keeping requirements. Manufacturing establishments are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA or other health authorities, in order to assess, among other things, compliance with cGMP. Before approval of the initiation of commercial manufacturing processes, the FDA will usually perform a preapproval inspection of the facility to determine its compliance with cGMP and other rules and regulations. In addition, foreign manufacturers must also comply with cGMPs in order to supply products for use in the United States, and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA or by regulatory authorities in certain countries under reciprocal agreements with the FDA. Manufacturing processes and facilities for pharmaceuticals are highly regulated. Regulatory authorities may choose not to certify or may impose restrictions, or even shut down existing manufacturing facilities that they determine are non-compliant.

FDA GRAS Determination
 
“GRAS” is an acronym for the phrase “generally recognized as safe,” which the FDA utilizes to describe those substances that, in the generally recognized opinion of the scientific community, will not be harmful to consumers, provided the substance is used as intended. According to applicable FDA regulations, any substance that is intentionally added to food is a food additive, which is subject to premarket review and approval by FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use. Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”), and FDA’s implementing regulations in 21 CFR 170.3 and 21 CFR 170.30, the use of a food substance may be GRAS either through scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food. General recognition of safety through scientific procedures requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive and ordinarily is based upon published studies, which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information. General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in foods requires a substantial history of consumption for food use by a significant number of consumers.
 
Manufacturers of GRAS substances may provide the FDA with a notification of GRAS determination, which includes a description of the substance, the applicable conditions of use, and an explanation of how the substance was determined to be safe. Upon review of such a notification, the FDA may respond with a “no questions” position, whereby the manufacturer’s determination that a product is GRAS for its intended purposes is affirmed. Alternatively, manufacturers may elect to “self-affirm” a given substance as GRAS without FDA notification but should retain all applicable safety data used for GRAS determination in the case of FDA inquiry.
 
Synthetic copies of naturally-occurring dietary ingredients or related components do not qualify as dietary ingredients under the FD&C Act, but substances that have been affirmed by the FDA as GRAS, self-affirmed as GRAS, or approved as direct food additives in the U.S. may be marketed as dietary ingredients, subject to FDA regulations for dietary ingredients.
 
FDA NDI Notification
 
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the “DSHEA”) (Pub. L. 103-417) was signed into law on October 25, 1994 and amended the FD&C Act by adding: (i) section 201(ff) (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)), which defines the term “dietary supplement”, and (ii) section 413 (21 U.S.C. 350b), which defines the term “new dietary ingredient” (“NDI”) and requires the manufacturer or distributor of an NDI, or of the dietary supplement that contains the NDI, to submit a premarket notification to FDA at least 75 days before introducing/delivering the supplement into interstate commerce, unless the NDI and any other dietary ingredients in the dietary supplement have been present in the food supply without chemical alteration (21 U.S.C. 350b(a)(1)). The NDI notification must contain applicable information, including history of use and citations to published articles, from which the manufacturer or distributor of the NDI or dietary supplement has concluded that the dietary supplement containing the NDI will be reasonably expected to be safe under the conditions of its intended use. NDI notifications are not required for the marketing of approved food additives or GRAS substances as NDIs unless the dietary ingredient has been chemically altered.

FDA Orphan Drug Designation
 
The Orphan Drug Act was signed into law on January 4, 1983. The Congressional findings for the Orphan Drug Act were as follows: (i) there are many rare diseases and conditions that affect such small numbers of individuals residing in the United States; (ii) adequate drugs for many rare diseases and conditions have not been developed; (iii) drugs for rare diseases and conditions are commonly referred to as “orphan drugs”; (iv) because so few individuals are affected by any one rare disease or condition, a pharmaceutical company that develops an orphan drug may reasonably expect the drug to generate relatively small sales in comparison to the cost of developing the drug and consequently to incur a financial loss; (v) there is reason to believe that some promising orphan drugs will not be developed unless changes are made in the applicable Federal laws to reduce the costs of developing such drugs and to provide financial incentives to develop such drugs; and (vi) it is in the public interest to provide such changes and incentives for the development of orphan drugs.
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition that (i) affects less than 200,000 persons in the United States, or (ii) affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 
In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and NDA user-fee waivers. In addition, if a drug receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan-designated drug. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different drugs for the indication that the orphan drug has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same drug but for a different indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our drugs for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our drug is determined to be contained within the competitor’s drug for the same indication or disease. If a drug designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. There can be no assurance that any request for orphan drug designation will be granted by the FDA.
 
Other Regulations
 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback and false claims laws. The Anti-Kickback Statute is a federal criminal statute that makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Some of the state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

In the course of practicing medicine, physicians may legally prescribe FDA approved drugs for an indication that has not been approved by the FDA and which, therefore, is not described in the product’s approved labeling, so-called “off-label use.” The FDA does not ordinarily regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA and other governmental agencies do, however, restrict communications on the subject of off-label use by a manufacturer or those acting on behalf of a manufacturer. Companies may not promote FDA-approved drugs for off-label uses. The FDA and other governmental agencies do permit a manufacturer (and those acting on its behalf) to engage in some limited, non-misleading, non-promotional exchanges of scientific information regarding unapproved indications. The United States False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including imprisonment, fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as possible exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In addition, under this and other applicable laws, such as the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, there is an ability for private individuals to bring similar actions. Further, there is an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the law.
 
We are subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations and institute criminal prosecution, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
We must comply with regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and other federal, state and local regulations. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, certain hazardous chemicals.
 
Our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We are also subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits companies and individuals from engaging in specified activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under the FCPA, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, governmental staff members, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. In addition, federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain health information, in particular, individually identifiable information, and restrict the use and disclosure of that information. At the federal level, the Department of Health and Human Services promulgated health information privacy and security rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. In addition, many state laws apply to the use and disclosure of health information.
 
Competition
 
The industry in which we intend to compete is subject to intense competition. We believe that our ability to compete will be dependent in large part upon our ability to continually enhance and improve our products and technologies. In order to do so, we plan to effectively utilize and expand our research and development capabilities. Competition is based primarily on scientific and technological superiority, technical support, availability of patent protection, protection of trade secrets, access to adequate capital, ability to develop, acquire and market products successfully, ability to obtain governmental approvals and ability to serve the particular needs of customers. We intend to compete on the basis of safety, effectiveness, convenience, manufacturing superiority, intellectual property, and where appropriate, price.

Many other companies are also developing or marketing astaxanthin products from various sources for various applications. Leading manufacturers of astaxanthin from microalgae include Cyanotech, which produces the BioAstin brand; Fuji Health Science (parent company: Fuji Chemical), which produces the AstaREAL brand; and Algatechnologies, which produces the AstaPure brand. Many other companies, including Valensa International (parent company: EID Parry), acquire astaxanthin from these or other manufacturers. We believe that large-scale, multi-fold expansion of naturally produced microalgal astaxanthin would require large amounts of land, and fresh water for open pond systems or large amounts of infrastructure and energy for closed systems, and, consequently, a significant if not overwhelming amount of investment capital. Furthermore, microalgal astaxanthin products, which are lipophilic extracts of a commercially cultivated microalgae, typically have relatively low astaxanthin content, with the majority of the product comprised of other lipophilic, non-astaxanthin microalgal compounds. In contrast, our synthetically manufactured astaxanthin products have very high astaxanthin content, with consistent purity. Higher relative astaxanthin content reduces the size/number of capsules or tablets required to achieve equivalent circulating levels of astaxanthin. We may also face competition from other synthetic astaxanthin products, although competitors in this space are limited by the substantial cost and technical expertise required to develop large-scale, industrial production of astaxanthin.
 
Our success will also depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain international and domestic patents, other intellectual property, and other legal protections for the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business. We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for our products where applicable by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where applicable, claims for composition of matter, uses, manufacturing processes, and formulations. Our success will also depend on our ability, and the ability of our current and/or future strategic partners to maintain trade secrets related to proprietary production methods for products that we, or our partners, intend to market.
 
Raw Materials and Components
 
We utilize contract manufacturers and/or other third-party suppliers for the production of our products. The raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products may be available, in some instances from one supplier, and in other instances, from multiple suppliers. In those cases where raw materials are only available through one supplier, such supplier may be either a sole source (the only recognized supply source available to us) or a single source (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We, our contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers will adopt appropriate policies to attempt, to the extent feasible, to minimize our raw material supply risks, including maintenance of greater levels of raw materials inventory and implementation of multiple raw materials sourcing strategies, especially for critical raw materials. Although to date we have not experienced any significant delays in obtaining any raw materials from suppliers, we cannot provide assurance that we, our contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers will not face shortages from one or more of them in the future.
 
Our ZanthoSyn® product manufacturing process relies on certain third-party manufacturers and suppliers that are not exclusive to us.
 
Customers
 
We sell ZanthoSyn® primarily through wholesale and e-commerce channels. We launched our e-commerce channel in 2016 and began selling to GNC stores in 2017. ZanthoSyn® is currently available at over three thousand GNC corporate stores in the United States.

We currently sell ZanthoSyn® to GNC under an exclusive sales contract for the “brick and mortar” retail channel in the United States, which comprises the majority of our revenues, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, sales to GNC accounted for more than 90% and more than 75% of our revenues, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues during these years.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have obtained and are continuing to seek patent protection for compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and pharmaceutical uses, in certain disease areas, of our various carotenoid analogs and derivatives. Such carotenoids include, but are not limited to, astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, and/or lycophyll, and esters and other analogs and derivatives of these compounds. More specifically, we seek to protect: (i) the composition of matter of novel carotenoid analogs and derivatives, (ii) pharmaceutical compositions comprising synthetic or natural preparations of novel or natural occurring carotenoid analogs and derivatives, and (iii) the pharmaceutical use of synthetic preparations of novel or naturally occurring carotenoid analogs and derivatives in specific disease areas, including, but not limited to, the treatment of inflammation and related tissue damage, liver disease, and reperfusion injury, as well as the pharmaceutical use of synthetic or natural preparations of novel or natural occurring carotenoid analogs and derivatives for the reduction of platelet aggregation. We intend to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights consistent with our strategic business objectives.
 
We own 28 issued patents, including 14 in the United States and 14 others in Europe, China, India, Japan, and Hong Kong, related to the technology described above. These patents will expire during the years of 2023 to 2028, subject to any patent term extensions of the individual patent. We have 1 patent application in the United States and 2 foreign patent applications pending in Europe and Brazil, also related to the technology described above. Of these patents and patent applications, 28 patents and 2 patent applications have coverage related to astaxanthin analogs and derivatives; however, our proprietary technologies and business opportunities are not dependent on any single patent or sub-set of patents—the portfolio, which includes coverage related to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and pharmaceutical uses, as described above, provides the comprehensive coverage that we deem material to our business.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this report, we have 12 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe the relations with our employees are satisfactory.
