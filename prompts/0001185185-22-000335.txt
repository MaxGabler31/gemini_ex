Item 1. Business Overview



The Company is engaged in providing transformational business management applications and technologies and professional consulting services to small and medium size companies, primarily in the manufacturing, distribution and service industries.



We are executing a multi-pronged business strategy centered on cloud-based products, services, recurring revenue, customer retention and on rapidly increasing the size of our installed customer base. The growth of our customer base is accomplished via both our traditional marketing programs and acquisitions. After a customer is secured, our strategy is to up-sell and cross-sell, providing the customer with advanced technologies and third-party add-ons that help them digitally transform their business. These add-on products could include application hosting, cybersecurity, warehouse management, human capital management, payment automation, sales tax compliance or any number of other products or services that we represent. Many of these incremental products and services are billed on a subscription basis, often paying monthly for the service, which increases our monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”). This strategy increases the average revenue per customer, which facilitates our continued growth, and reduces our cost of customer acquisition, which enhances our profitability profile.



As a business application, technology and consulting company, we provide strategies and solutions to meet our clients’ information, technology and business management needs. Our services and technologies enable customers to manage, protect and monetize their enterprise assets whether on-premise or in the cloud. As a value-added reseller of business application software, we offer solutions for accounting and business management, financial reporting, Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”), Human Capital Management (“HCM”), Warehouse Management Systems (“WMS”), Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”), and Business Intelligence (“BI”). Additionally, we have our own development staff building software solutions for various ERP enhancements. Our value-added services focus on consulting and professional services, specialized programming, training, and technical support. We have a dedicated Information Technology (“IT”) network services practice that provides managed services, cybersecurity, application hosting, disaster recovery, business continuity, cloud and other services. Our customers are nationwide, with concentrations in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area, Arizona, Connecticut, Southern California, North Carolina, Washington, Oregon and Illinois.



Our core business is divided into the following practice areas:



ERP (Enterprise Resource Management) and Accounting Software



We are a value-added reseller for a number of industry-leading ERP applications. We are a Sage Software Authorized Business Partner and Sage Certified Gold Development Partner. We believe we are among the largest Sage partners in North America, with a sales and implementation presence complemented by a scalable software development practice for customizations and enhancements. Due to the growing demand for cloud-based ERP solutions, we also have in our ERP portfolio Acumatica, a browser-based ERP solution that can be offered on premise, in the public cloud, or in a private cloud. We develop and resell a variety of add-on solutions to all our ERP and accounting packages that help customize the installation to our customers’ needs and streamline their operations.



Value-Added Services for ERP



We go beyond simply reselling software packages; we have a consulting and professional services organization that manages the process as we move from the sales stage into implementation, go live, and production. We work inside our customers’ organizations to ensure all software and IT solutions are enhancing their business needs. A significant portion of our services revenue comes from continuing to work with existing customers as their business needs change, upgrading from one version of software to another, or providing additional software solutions to help them manage their business and grow their revenue. We have a dedicated help desk team that fields hundreds of calls every week. Our custom programming department builds specialized software packages as well as “off the shelf” enhancements and time and billing software.



Network and Managed Services



We provide comprehensive IT network and managed services designed to eliminate the IT concerns of our customers. Businesses can focus on their core strengths rather than technology issues. We adapt our solutions for virtually any type of business from product and service providers to small businesses with local customers. Our business continuity services provide automatic on-site and off-site backups, complete encryption, and automatic failure testing. We also provide application hosting, IT consulting and managed network services. Our focus in the network and managed services practice is to focus on industry verticals in order to demonstrate our ability to better understand our customers’ needs.

Industry Overview



As a value-added reseller of business application software, we offer solutions for accounting and business management, financial reporting, managed services, ERP, HCM, WMS, CRM, and BI. Additionally, we have our own development staff building software solutions for various ERP enhancements. Our value-added services focus on consulting and professional services, specialized programming, training, and technical support. The majority of our customers are small and medium businesses (“SMBs”).
Potential Competitive Strengths




• | Independent Software Vendor. As an independent software vendor we have published integrations between ERPs and third-party products which differentiates us from other business application providers because, as a value-added reseller of the ERPs that our proprietary products integrate with, we have specific software solution expertise in the ERPs we resell, which ensures that our products tightly integrate with the ERPs. We own the intellectual property related to these integrations and sell the solutions both directly and through other software resellers within the Sage network. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sage Certified Gold Development Partner. As a Sage Certified Gold Development Partner, we are licensed to customize the source code of the Sage ERPs. Very few resellers are master developers, and in fact, we provide custom programming services for many other resellers. We have full-time programmers on staff, which provides us with a depth and breadth of expertise that we believe very few competitors can match.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to Recruit, Manage and Retain Quality Personnel. We have a track record of recruiting, managing and retaining skilled labor and our ability to do so represents an important advantage in an industry in which a shortage of skilled labor is often a key limitation for both clients and competitors alike. We recruit skilled labor from competitors and from amongst end users with experience using the various products we sell, whom we then train as consultants. We believe our ability to hire, manage and maintain skilled labor gives us an edge over our competitors as we continue to grow.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Combination of Hardware/Software Expertise. Many competitors have software solution expertise. Others have network/hardware expertise. We believe we are among the very few organizations with an expertise in both software and hardware, affording us the opportunity to provide turnkey solutions for our customers without the need to bring in additional vendors on a project.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technical Expertise. Our geographical reach and substantial technical capabilities afford our clients the ability to customize and tailor solutions to satisfy all of their business needs.

Our Growth Strategy



General



Our strategy is to grow our business through a combination of intra-company growth of our software applications, technology solutions and managed services, as well as expansion through acquisitions. We have established a national presence via our internal marketing, sales programs, and acquisitions and now have ERP customers throughout most of the United States.



Intra-Company Growth



Our intra-company growth strategy is to increase our market penetration and client retention through the upgrade of, and expanded sales efforts with our existing products and managed services and development of new and enhanced software and technology solutions. Our client retention is sustained by our providing responsive, ongoing software and technical support and monitoring and maintenance services for both the solutions we sell and other client technology needs we provide.



Repeat business from our existing customer base has been key to our success and we expect it will continue to play a vital role in our growth. We focus on nurturing long-standing relationships with existing customers while also establishing relationships with new customers.

Acquisitions



The markets in which we provide our services are occupied by a large number of competitors, many substantially larger than us, and with significantly greater resources and geographic reach. We believe that to remain competitive, we need to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that arise which may help us achieve greater geographic presence and economies both within our existing footprint and expanded territories. We may also utilize acquisitions, whenever appropriate, to expand our technological capabilities and product offerings. We focus on acquisitions that are profitable and fit seamlessly with our existing operations.



We believe our markets contain a number of attractive acquisition candidates. We foresee expanding through acquisitions of one or more of the following types of software and technology organizations:



Managed Service Providers (“MSPs”). MSPs provide their small and medium-sized business clients with a suite of services, which may include 24/7/365 remote monitoring of networks, disaster recovery, business continuity, data back-up, cyber-security and the like. There are hundreds of providers of such services in the U.S., most with annual recurring revenue of less than $10 million. We believe that we may be able to consolidate a number of these MSPs with our existing operation in an effort to become one of the more significant providers of these services in the U.S.
Independent Software Vendors (“ISVs”). ISVs are publishers of both stand-alone software solutions and integrations that integrate with other third-party products. Our interest lies with ISVs selling into the small and medium-sized business marketplace, providing applications addressing e-commerce, mobility, security, and other functionalities. Since we have expertise in both selling directly to end-users and selling through a sales channel, we believe we can significantly enhance the sales volume of any potential acquisition via our existing infrastructure, our sales channel, and our internal marketing programs. There are many ISVs in North America, constituting a large and significant target base for our acquisition efforts.



Value-Added Resellers (“VARs”) of ERP, Human Capital Management (“HCM”), Warehouse Management Systems (“WMS”), CRM and BI Software. VAR’s gross margins are a function of the sales volume they provide a publisher in a twelve (12) month period, and we are currently operating at the highest margins. Smaller resellers who sell less and operate at significantly lower margins, are at a competitive disadvantage to companies such as ours and are often amenable to creating a liquidity event for themselves by selling to larger organizations. We have benefitted from completing such acquisitions in a number of ways, including but not limited to: (i) garnering new customers to whom we can upsell and cross-sell our broad range of products and services; (ii) gaining technical resources that enhance our capabilities; and (iii) extending our geographic reach.



Our business strategy provides that we will examine the potential acquisition of businesses within and outside our industry. In determining a suitable acquisition candidate, we will carefully analyze a target’s potential to add to and complement our product mix, expand our existing revenue base, improve our margins, expand our geographic coverage, strengthen our management team, add technical resources and expertise, and, above all, improve stockholder returns. More specifically, we have identified the criteria listed below, by which we evaluate potential acquisition targets in an effort to gain the synergies necessary for successful growth of the Company:




● | Access to new customers and geographic markets;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | Recurring revenue of the target;
--+---------------------------------


● | Opportunity to gain operating leverage and increased profit margins;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversification of sales by customer and/or product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Improvements in product/service offerings; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | Ability to attract public capital and increased investor interest.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------




We are unable to predict the nature, size or timing of any acquisition. We can give no assurance that we will reach agreement or procure the financial resources necessary to fund any acquisition, or that we will be able to successfully integrate or improve returns as a result of any such acquisition.

We continue to seek out and hold preliminary discussions with various acquisition candidates.



On April 1, 2021, SWK acquired certain assets of CT-Solution, Inc. (“CTS”), a leading Indianapolis-based reseller of Sage Software solutions. Over the last 20 years, CT-Solution has implemented technology applications at prominent manufacturers, distributors, and professional service organizations throughout the Midwest.



On May 1, 2021, SWK acquired certain assets of PeopleSense, Inc. (“PSI”), a leading Chicago-based reseller of Sage Software's human resource management solutions. Over the last 18 years, PeopleSense has implemented HCM solutions to clientele spanning over half of the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.



On January 1, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Dynamic Tech Services, Inc (“DTS”), a Georgia corporation pursuant to which SWK acquired from DTS certain assets related to the component of DTS’ operations devoted to selling and supporting Acumatica Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning solutions.



On January 22, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of NEO3, LLC (“NEO3”), an Ohio-based company related to its Sage 100 and Acumatica operations.



Currently we have not entered into any other agreements or understandings for any acquisitions that management deems material.



Enterprise Resource Planning Software Strategy



Our ERP software strategy is focused on serving the needs of our expansive installed base of customers for our Sage 100, Sage 500, and Sage BusinessWorks practices, while rapidly growing the number of customers using Sage X3 and Acumatica. We currently have approximately 8,000 active ERP customers using one of these six solutions, including customers using certain add-on support products to these solutions. In the past we, have focused primarily on on-premise mid-market Sage Software solutions but in the past few years have focused on larger enterprise-type offerings and cloud ERP solutions. This has allowed us to increase our average deal size and to keep pace with the changing trends that we see in the industry.
Managed Services Strategy



The IT Managed Services market is broadly segmented by types of services, for example, managed datacenter, managed network, managed mobility, managed infrastructure, managed communications, managed information, managed security and other managed services. In addition, the market is segmented by market verticals, such as public sector, banking, financial services and insurance, education, retail, contact centers and service industries, high tech and telecommunications, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, travel and logistics, manufacturing, energy and utilities among others.



The recent trend in the industry shows that there is a high demand for managed services across every industry vertical. The implementation of managed services can reduce IT costs by 30% to 40% in such enterprises. This enables organizations to have flexibility and technical advantage. Enterprises having their services outsourced look forward to risk sharing and to reduce their IT costs and IT commitments, so that they can concentrate on their core competencies. Organizations implementing managed services have reported almost a 50% to 60% increase in the operational efficiency of their outsourced processes. Enterprises have accepted outsourcing services as a means to enable them to reduce their capital expenditures (CapEx) and free up internal sources. Newer managed services that penetrate almost all the industry domains, along with aggressive pricing in services, are being offered. This results in an increase in the overall revenues of the managed services market. It is observed that there is an increase in outsourcing of wireless, communications, mobility, and other value-added services, such as content and e-commerce facilities. With increasing technological advancements and the cost challenges associated with having the IT services in-house, we believe the future seems optimistic for managed services providers.



Our strategy is to continue to expand our product offerings to the small and medium sized business marketplace, and to increase our scale and capabilities via acquisition throughout the United States, but initially in those regions where we currently have existing offices.



Geographic Expansion



Generally, our technology offerings require some on-premise implementation and support. When we expand into new geographic territories, we prefer to find qualified personnel in an area to augment our current staff of consultants to service our business. The need for hands-on implementation and support may also require investment in additional physical offices and other overhead. We believe our approach is conservative.



We may accelerate expansion if we find complementary businesses that we are able to acquire in other regions. Our marketing efforts to expand into new territories have included attendance at trade shows in addition to personal contact.

Our Products and Services



Enterprise Resource Planning Software



Substantially all our initial sales of ERP financial accounting solutions consist of pre-packaged software and associated services to customers in the United States.



The Company resells ERP software published by Sage Software, Acumatica and other providers for the financial accounting requirements of small- and medium-sized businesses focused on manufacturing and distribution, and the delivery of related services from the sales of these products, including installation, support and training. The programs perform and support a wide variety of functions related to accounting, including financial reporting, accounts payable and accounts receivable, and inventory management.



We provide a variety of services along with our financial accounting software sales to assist our customers in maximizing the benefits from these software applications. These services include training, technical support, and professional services. We employ class instructors and have formal, specific training in the topics they are teaching. We can also provide on-site training services that are highly tailored to meet the needs of a particular customer. Our instructors must pass annual subject-matter examinations required by Sage to retain their product-based teaching certifications.



We provide end-user technical support services through our support/help desk. Our product and technology consultants assist customers calling with questions about product features, functions, usability issues, and configurations. The support/help desk offers services in a variety of ways, including prepaid services, time and materials billed as utilized and annual support contracts. Customers can communicate with the support/help desk through e-mail, telephone, and fax channels. Standard support/help desk services are offered during normal business hours five (5) days per week.



Warehouse Management Systems



We are resellers of High Jump Warehouse Edge (formerly Accellos One Warehouse Management System) (“WMS”) software published by High Jump, Inc. (“High Jump”). High Jump develops warehouse management software for mid-market distributors. The primary purpose of a WMS is to control the movement and storage of materials within an operation and process the associated transactions. Directed picking, directed replenishment, and directed put-away are the key to WMS. The detailed setup and processing within a WMS can vary significantly from one software vendor to another. However, the basic WMS will use a combination of item, location, quantity, unit of measure, and order information to determine where to stock, where to pick, and in what sequence to perform these operations.



The WMS software improves accuracy and efficiency, streamlines materials handling, meets retail compliance requirements, and refines inventory control. Accellos also works as part of a complete operational solution by integrating seamlessly with radio frequency hardware, accounting software, shipping systems and warehouse automation equipment.



We market the Accellos solution to our existing and new medium-sized business customers.



IT Managed Network Services and Business Consulting



We provide IT managed services, cybersecurity, business continuity, disaster recovery, data back-up, network maintenance and service upgrades for our business clients. We are a Microsoft Solutions Provider. Our staff includes engineers who maintain certifications from Microsoft and Sage Software. They are Microsoft Certified Systems Engineers and Microsoft Certified Professionals, and they provide a host of services for our clients, including remote network monitoring, server implementation, support and assistance, operation and maintenance of large central systems, technical design of network infrastructure, technical troubleshooting for large scale problems, network and server security, and backup, archiving, and storage of data from servers. There are numerous competitors, both larger and smaller, nationally and locally, with whom we compete in this market.
Cybersecurity



We provide enterprise level security services to the mid-market. Our cybersecurity-as-a-service offering includes a security operations center, incident response, cybersecurity assessments, and hacking simulations. The service is particularly well-suited for customers in compliance-driven and regulated industries, including financial services, pension administration, insurance, and the land and title sector.

Application Hosting



We provide hosting services to customers located throughout the country within our own data centers.



Product Development



We are continually looking to improve and develop new products. Our product initiatives include various new product offerings, which generally are extensions of existing products. We are using a dual-shore development approach to keep product development costs at a minimum. All our product development is led by U.S. based employees. The project leaders are technical resources who are involved in developing technical specifications, design decisions, usability testing, and transferring the project knowledge to our offshore development team. Several times per week, the product development leadership team meets with our project leaders and development teams to discuss project status, development obstacles, and project timelines.
Arrangements with Principal Suppliers



Our revenues are primarily derived from the resale of vendor software products and services. These resales are made pursuant to channel sales agreements whereby we are granted authority to purchase and resell the vendor products and services. Under these agreements, we either resell software directly to our customers or act as a sales agent for various vendors and receive commissions for our sales efforts.



We are required to enter into an annual Channel Partner Agreement with Sage Software whereby Sage Software appoints us as a non-exclusive partner to market, distribute, and support Sage 100, Sage 500, and Sage Intacct. The Channel Partner Agreement is for a one-year term, and automatically renews for an additional one-year term on the anniversary of the agreement’s effective date. These agreements authorize us to sell these software products to customers in the United States. There are no clauses in this agreement that limit or restrict the services that we can offer to customers. We also operate a Sage Software Authorized Training Center Agreement and are party to a Master Developers Program License Agreement.



For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, purchases from one supplier through a “channel partner” agreement were approximately 13% and 15% respectively. This channel partner agreement is for a one-year term and automatically renews for an additional one-year term on the anniversary of the agreements effective date. Generally, the Company does not rely on any one specific supplier for all its purchases and maintains relationships with other suppliers that could replace its existing supplier should the need arise.



Customers



We market our products primarily throughout North America. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the top ten customers accounted for 9% ($3,644,319) and 10% ($4,246,257), respectively, of total revenues. Generally, we do not rely on any one specific customer for any significant portion of our revenue base. No single customer accounted for ten percent or more of our consolidated revenues base.
Intellectual Property



We regard our technology and other proprietary rights as essential to our business. We rely on copyright, trade secret, confidentiality procedures, contract provisions, and trademark law to protect our technology and intellectual property. We have also entered into confidentiality agreements with our consultants and corporate partners and intend to control access to, and distribution of our products, documentation, and other proprietary information.
Competition



Our markets are highly fragmented, and the business is characterized by a large number of participants, including several large companies, as well significant number of small, privately-held, local competitors. A significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from requests for proposals (“RFPs”) and price is often an important factor in awarding such agreements. Accordingly, our competitors may underbid us if they elect to price their services aggressively to procure such business. Our competitors may also develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services, and we may not be able to enhance our competitive position. The principal competitive factors for our professional services include geographic presence, breadth of service offerings, technical skills, quality of service and industry reputation. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors.
