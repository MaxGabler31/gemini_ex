ITEM 1.   BUSINESS 
OVERVIEW 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the research and development of innovative therapeutics to treat cancers and rare diseases. Our mission is to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule drugs in areas of high unmet need that will dramatically extend and improve the lives of our patients. These product candidates target biological pathways implicated in a wide range of cancers and certain non-oncology indications. Our discovery and development efforts are guided, when possible, by an understanding of the role of biomarkers, which are indicators of a particular biological condition or process and may predict the clinical benefit of our compounds in defined patient populations. Our clinical-stage pipeline consists of four product candidates, all of which are in targeted patient populations, making ArQule a leader among companies our size in precision medicine. 
 ArQule has a long history of kinase drug discovery and development, having discovered and introduced ten kinase inhibitors into clinical trials. Our drug discovery efforts have been informed by our historical expertise in chemistry, our work in rational drug design and by our insight into kinase binding and regulation. We have applied this knowledge to produce significant chemical matter for a number of kinase targets and to build an extensive library of proprietary compounds with the potential to target multiple kinases in oncology and other therapeutic areas, such as rare diseases. We may bring further preclinical programs forward and interrogate our library against new targets beyond kinases either directly or with collaborators. 
 Our proprietary pipeline of orally bioavailable product candidates is directed toward molecular targets and biological processes with demonstrated roles in the development of both human cancers and rare, non-oncology diseases. All of these programs are being developed in targeted, biomarker-defined patient populations. By identifying subgroups of patients that are most likely to respond to our product candidates, we seek to target small, often orphan, indications that allow for focused and efficient development. In addition to pursuing these potentially fast-to-market strategies, we also pursue development in other indications that could allow us to expand the utility of the product candidates, if approved. Our clinical pipeline includes the following product candidates: 
 •

 ARQ 531 is a potent and reversible dual inhibitor of both wild type and C481S-mutant Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) that is in Phase 1 clinical development for B-cell malignancies refractory to other therapeutic options 
 ​
 •

 Miransertib (ARQ 092) is a potent and selective inhibitor of protein kinase B (AKT), a serine/​threonine kinase. We expect to commence a registrational clinical trial of miransertib for the treatment of Proteus syndrome and PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Syndromes (PROS) in the first half of 2019. Miransertib is also in Phase 1b clinical development in oncology in combination with the hormonal therapy, anastrozole 
 ​
 •

 ARQ 751 is a next-generation, highly potent and selective inhibitor of AKT that is in Phase 1 clinical development for solid tumors harboring AKT, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutations or that are PTEN null 
 ​
 •

 Derazantinib (ARQ 087) is a multi-kinase inhibitor designed to preferentially inhibit the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family of kinases that is in a registrational clinical trial in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) in patients with FGFR2 fusions. Derazantinib was exclusively licensed to Basilea Pharmaceutica Limited (Basilea) in April 2018 in the United States, European Union, Japan and the rest of the world, excluding the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (collectively, Greater China) where derazantinib was exclusively licensed to Sinovant Sciences Ltd., a subsidiary of Roivant Sciences Ltd. (Sinovant) in February 2018

  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
 OUR STRATEGY 
 Our strategy is to build a commercial-stage biotechnology company that uses precision medicine to develop small molecule drugs in biomarker-defined patient populations where such drugs are likely to have the greatest clinical benefit. Specifically, we intend to accomplish this through the following activities: 
 •

  Advance proprietary pipeline programs to achieve rapid proof of principle and regulatory approval. ARQ 531 is in a dose escalation clinical trial in patients with highly refractory B-cell malignancies where it will have the opportunity to show rapid proof of principle in the biomarker-defined C481S-mutant BTK patient population. We expect miransertib to be in a registrational clinical trial in the first half of 2019 in two rare, genetically defined overgrowth diseases. Derazantinib is in a potential fast-to-market registrational clinical trial in approximately 100 patients with iCCA with FGFR2 fusions in collaboration with Basilea and Sinovant. 
 ​
 •

  Pursue precision medicine. We pursue precision medicine approaches with our proprietary pipeline to define patient populations with the highest likelihood of benefitting from our therapies based on our insights into functional biomarkers, with the goal of achieving greater speed, efficiency and enhanced outcomes in the development process. All of our product candidates are being developed in clinical trials with biomarker-defined populations. 
 ​
 •

  Focus on cancer, a market with a large unmet need. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2019 approximately 607,000 cancer-related deaths are projected to occur and more than 1.7 million new cases of cancer are projected to be diagnosed in the United States. Demographic trends and improved screening are expected to increase the rate of cancer diagnoses, as approximately 77 percent of cancers occur in the over-55-year-old population. 
 ​
 •

  Expand our efforts in rare diseases. We have expanded beyond oncology into rare disease indications by utilizing our oncology expertise in targets that are common to both disease settings and by collaborating with the academic leaders in these fields. In all instances, we pursue a biomarker-defined precision medicine strategy in areas of high unmet need that also provides the opportunity for accelerated development. We expect to to launch a registrational clinical trial in Proteus syndrome and PROS in the first half of 2019. 
 ​
 •

  Continue to expand diagnostic expertise through collaborations. We have extensive experience partnering with diagnostic companies for clinical trials in many parts of the world. In early clinical testing, we often utilize existing diagnostic technologies to identify patient subsets with the highest likelihood of clinical benefit. In later-stage clinical development, particularly in registrational trials such as the derazantinib trial in iCCA with Basilea, we collaborate with experienced diagnostic partners to support our clinical and commercial precision medicine strategy. 
 ​
 •

  Benefit from the resources and strength of our collaborators. We pursue alliances for our programs with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as research institutions and independent investigators, to finance operations, offset spending, balance risk and gain expertise.

OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES 
 BTK Program: ARQ 531 
 Overview 
 ARQ 531 is an investigational, orally bioavailable, potent and reversible dual inhibitor of both wild type and C481S-mutant BTK. BTK is a key component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway and has emerged as a critical target in the treatment of B-cell malignancies. The leading approved BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, improves survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) compared to standard chemotherapy or immune therapy. However, in a subset of patients, a somatic mutation (C481S) of the covalent binding site results in acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy and in poor clinical outcomes for these patients. 
 ARQ 531 has demonstrated promising activity in both in vitro and in vivo models. These data suggest that ARQ 531 could be effective against both wild type and C481S-mutant BTK, as well as other indications where ibrutinib is not highly effective. We intend to pursue an expedited development strategy in patients with the C481S mutation and explore other indications in B-cell malignancies where ARQ 531 shows the greatest promise. We presented data from the first six cohorts of a dose escalation clinical trial of ARQ 531 at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference in December 2018. 
 Background on BTK Inhibitors 
 B-cell malignancies, such as CLL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are driven by BTK. The leading BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, is irreversible and makes a covalent bond with the C481 residue of the targeted protein. Although ibrutinib has demonstrated excellent responses in patients with elevated BCR signaling, clinical resistance has been observed, and the BTK C481S-mutation that prevents covalent binding of ibrutinib to BTK is emerging as a predominant mechanism of resistance. 
 Currently it is estimated that approximately 20% of patients treated with ibrutinib become refractory, or resistant, to ibrutinib, and this incidence is expected to grow as more patients are prescribed ibrutinib and patient time on therapy increases. The BTK-C481S mutation is the most prevalent resistance mechanism for patients who become refractory to ibrutinib, representing approximately 85% of refractory cases in CLL. Currently there is no approved targeted therapy for ibrutinib refractory patients with the C481S mutation. 
 ARQ 531 is a highly optimized, small molecule, reversible inhibitor of C481S-mutant BTK and wild type BTK. As a reversible inhibitor, ARQ 531 does not require interaction with the C481 residue, a binding site essential for irreversible BTK inhibitors, thus potentially positioning ARQ 531 as a targeted therapy for CLL, DLBCL and MCL patients harboring C481S-mutant BTK who have developed resistance to

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 irreversible BTK inhibitors. ARQ 531 has also demonstrated strong signs of preclinical activity in wild type BTK models, including the highly predictive TCL1 mouse model conducted by our collaborators at The Ohio State University. These and other data suggest additional development opportunities for ARQ 531.

 Oral, reversible dual inhibitor of both wild type and C481S-mutant BTK 
 ​
 •

 Potently inhibits activation of the C481S-mutant BTK with long residence time 
 ​

 ​
 •

 Composition of matter patent protection through December 2035 
 ​
 Preclinical Development of ARQ 531 
 In August 2018, we and our collaborators at The Ohio State University published a comprehensive paper in Cancer Discovery detailing the findings from multiple in vitro and in vivo studies with ARQ 531. This paper also depicts the chemical structure of ARQ 531 and its crystal structure as resident in the binding pocket of BTK, which substantially explains its ability to inhibit both wild type and C481S-mutant BTK. 
 Specifically, the paper demonstrated that in vitro treatment of CLL cells with ARQ 531 decreases BTK-mediated functions including BCR signaling, viability and migration. In vivo, ARQ 531 was found to increase survival over ibrutinib in an engraftment mouse model of CLL and in an engraftment mouse model resembling Richter’s transformation. 
 Clinical Development of ARQ 531 
 We filed an investigational new drug application (IND) for ARQ 531 in the first quarter of 2017 and commenced a Phase 1a/b clinical trial in the third quarter of 2017 to study the safety of ARQ 531, look for signs of activity in a number of indications, including in CLL patients harboring the BTK-C481S mutation, and to identify a therapeutic dose. 
 In December 2018, we presented interim safety and efficacy data from the initial six cohorts of the Phase 1a portion of the clinical trial at the ASH conference. The interim data demonstrated a manageable safety profile for ARQ 531 and anti-tumor activity was observed in nine out of 20 patients. Subject to the receipt of additional data, we expect to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose for ARQ 531 in 2019 and thereafter to enroll a number of expansion cohorts at the recommended Phase 2 dose. For later stage clinical testing, we initially plan to pursue a fast-to-market strategy in patients with the C481S mutation. In addition, because ARQ 531 potently inhibits wild type BTK and other kinases relevant to B-cell malignancies, we expect to evaluate ARQ 531 in other indications where ibrutinib is not highly effective and where ARQ 531 could be superior. We plan to report additional clinical data on ARQ 531 at a major medical conference in 2019. 
 AKT Program: Miransertib (ARQ 092) and ARQ 751 
 Overview 
 Miransertib (ARQ 092) and our next generation AKT inhibitor, ARQ 751, are oral, potent and selective inhibitors of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3 are key signaling protein kinases of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway that are involved in processes associated with cancer such as cell proliferation, migration, survival and protein synthesis. Activation of this pathway is common in many cancers, suggesting that AKT kinases are compelling targets for the treatment of oncology indications.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Dysregulation of AKT is also a driver of certain rare proliferative disorders. For example, the E17K mutation of AKT1 causes Proteus syndrome, an ultra-rare condition characterized by the aberrant overgrowth of multiple tissues of the body. Patients with Proteus syndrome experience changes in the shapes of certain body structures over time, including abnormal, often asymmetric, massive growth (overgrowth) of the skeleton, skin, adipose tissue and central nervous system out of proportion to the rest of the body. Similarly, PROS is a group of rare disorders that cause overgrowth of parts of the body due to gain-of-function mutations in the PIK3CA gene, including Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, CLOVES syndrome, megalencephalies, infiltrating facial lipomatosis and many others. Miransertib and ARQ 751 have been shown preclinically and clinically to inhibit AKT and PI3K cell signaling and therefore may provide the potential for much-needed treatment options for patients with these diseases. 
 Background on AKT inhibitors 
 There are currently no approved AKT inhibitors for the treatment of cancers or rare overgrowth diseases, although there are a number of product candidates in various stages of clinical development in oncology. Miransertib and ARQ 751 are investigational, allosteric inhibitors of AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3. Both molecules are derived from a proprietary chemical class with distinct ADME and PK properties. Because ARQ 092 and ARQ 751 do not bind to AKT at the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site, they are differentiated from ATP-competitive inhibitors of AKT, and we believe may provide greater selectivity and possibly fewer toxicities. 
 Miransertib (ARQ 092) 
 Key Characteristics of Miransertib 
 •

 Potent, selective, allosteric pan-AKT inhibitor 
 ​
 •

 Clinical effect observed in a number of oncology patients showing response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) responses 
 ​
 •

 Inhibition of AKT signaling observed in patients at low doses, presenting attractive profile for treatment of certain rare diseases 
 ​
 •

 Manageable safety profile 
 ​
 •

 Good drug-like properties 
 ​
 Preclinical Development of Miransertib 
 Preclinical studies of miransertib showed high potency against AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3, with nanomolar inhibition of downstream proteins. Cancer cells that harbor the E17K-AKT1 mutation, the H1047R-PIK3CA mutation or that are PTEN-null are the most sensitive to miransertib. Tumor growth inhibition was observed in human tumor xenograft mouse models and PDX models of endometrial cancer and breast cancer harboring these mutations. In other preclinical studies, miransertib demonstrated combinability with standard of care in multiple cancer types, including in combination with trametinib for endometrial cancer, and in combination with paclitaxel or trastuzumab for breast cancer. 
Clinical Development of Miransertib – Non-oncology (Rare Diseases) 
 In October 2018, we and our collaborators presented preliminary clinical data at the American Society of Human Genetics conference demonstrating the potential utility of miransertib in both Proteus syndrome and PROS. The data demonstrated that miransertib was well tolerated with a demonstrated manageable toxicity profile. Data from two patients treated as part of our named patient/compassionate use program showed, with respect to the patient with Proteus syndrome, an improvement in symptoms including improved mobility/bone changes, and with respect to the patient with PROS, clinical stabilization and radiological improvement of disease. Preliminary results from an open-label, phase 1/2 clinical trial of miransertib in patients with PROS showed evidence of clinical activity, as demonstrated by improvements in disease related symptoms and objective radiologic and photographic measures. In February 2019, we and

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 our collaborators announced additional pharmacodynamic, safety and clinical activity data for miransertib in patients with Proteus syndrome. The data demonstrated good target engagement, tolerability and reductions in lesion size and pain, especially in children. We expect to launch a registrational clinical trial in Proteus syndrome and PROS in the first half of 2019. 
Orphan Designation 
 In November 2015 and March 2018, we received orphan drug designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), respectively, in Proteus syndrome. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). In each case, the orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives and certain marketing exclusivity for products that receive commercial approval. 
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation 
 In the fourth quarter of 2017 we received rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA in connection with Proteus syndrome. The designation provides the opportunity for us to apply for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher. The FDA awards priority review vouchers to sponsors of rare pediatric disease product applications that meet specified criteria. Under this program and subject to certain limitations, a sponsor like ArQule who may receive approval for a drug in a rare pediatric disease may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. If received, the pediatric voucher confers a valuable benefit to companies working in areas where the commercial opportunity is not as great as in other diseases. 
Fast Track Designation 
 In September 2018, the FDA granted fast track designation to miransertib for the treatment of PROS. The FDA’s fast track program aims to expedite the development and review of drugs which treat serious or life-threatening conditions and have demonstrated the potential to address unmet clinical needs. 
Clinical Development of Miransertib – Oncology 
 We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of miransertib in which it demonstrated a manageable safety profile and showed single agent activity, achieving partial responses in a number of patients whose tumors harbor AKT1 or PI3K mutations. A Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating miransertib in combination with the aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, in patients with advanced endometrial cancer is currently ongoing. 
ARQ 751 
 Key Characteristics of ARQ 751 
 •

 Highly potent and selective allosteric pan-AKT inhibitor 
 ​
 •

 Differentiated toxicology profile from miransertib suggests improved therapeutic index 
 ​
 •

 Differentiated PK profile from miransertib may lead to more favorable dosing characteristics 
 ​
 •

 Prolonged growth inhibition in several tumor xenograft mouse models 
 ​
 •

 Good drug-like properties

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Preclinical Development of ARQ 751 
 ARQ 751 is our next generation AKT inhibitor. The profile of ARQ 751 is similar to miransertib but shows a 5 to 15 fold increase in potency across binding, biochemical and cellular assays. ARQ 751 also is differentiated at the ADME and PK levels, as it has lower volume of distribution and does not accumulate in tissues. In GLP-toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, ARQ 751 had fewer and less severe rashes compared to miransertib, a toxicity common to AKT inhibitors in development. 
 Clinical Development of ARQ 751 
 ARQ 751 is currently being tested in a Phase 1 clinical trial for solid tumors harboring AKT, PI3K, or PTEN mutations or that are PTEN null. In November 2018, we presented preliminary data from the dose escalation portion of this trial at the EORTC/AACR/NCI Symposium. The data showed that ARQ 751 had manageable toxicity at the recommended Phase 2 dose of 75 mg QD. ARQ 751 demonstrated preliminary anti-tumor activity in two patients who each achieved a partial response after eight weeks on treatment. In addition, eleven patients had stable disease. Based upon these preliminary results, we plan to continue clinical development of ARQ 751 as a monotherapy and/or in combination with other anti-cancer agents. 
 FGFR Program: Derazantinib (ARQ 087) 
 Overview 
 Derazantinib is an oral, multi-kinase inhibitor designed to preferentially inhibit the FGFR family of kinases with demonstrated activity in FGFR2 genetic alterations, including fusions. Fibroblast growth factors and their receptors tightly regulate key cellular behaviors, such as proliferation, cell differentiation, cell migration, cell survival and angiogenesis. FGFR dysregulation has been identified as a driver in a number of cancers, including iCCA, cholangiocarcinoma, bladder, endometrial, breast, gastric, lung and ovarian. 
 Given the high unmet need and activity observed in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of derazantinib, we selected iCCA as our first indication in a registrational clinical trial. iCCA is a rare type of bile duct cancer that originates from the intrahepatic biliary ductal system and forms an intrahepatic mass. The disease is often diagnosed late because it presents as asymptomatic. There are currently no approved therapies for iCCA. Both the FDA and EMA have granted derazantinib orphan drug designation for iCCA. We have exclusively licensed derazantinib to Basilea in the United States, European Union, Japan and the rest of the world, excluding Greater China where derazantinib has been exclusively licensed to Sinovant. 
 Key Characteristics of Derazantinib 
 •

 Multi-kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 with demonstrated clinical activity 
 ​
 •

 Positive response rate observed in biomarker-defined iCCA population with FGFR2 fusions 
 ​
 •

 Safety profile differentiated from other FGFR inhibitors 
 ​
 •

 Consistent drug exposure with once-a-day dosing regimen 
 ​
 •

 Drug profile allows for combinability 
 ​
 Clinical Development of Derazantinib 
 We previously conducted a Phase 1a and Phase 2 clinical trial of derazantinib for the treatment of patients with iCCA. We observed six partial responses out of 29 evaluable patients representing a 21% response rate. Additionally, an 83% disease control rate and median time on treatment of over 26 weeks were observed in the trials, and the drug demonstrated a manageable side effect profile. 
 We initiated a registrational, biomarker-driven trial in second-line iCCA patients with FGFR2 fusions in the fourth quarter of 2017 and transferred the trial to Basilea in connection with the exclusive license we granted to them in April 2018. The trial is designed to be single-arm, response rate driven and will enroll approximately 100 patients in the United States and European Union. In January 2019, Basilea announced 

 10

  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
 the results of an interim analysis in the clinical trial. The interim analysis was conducted after 42 patients had been enrolled, with a subset of 29 evaluable patients who had at least one post-baseline imaging assessment. The objective response rate in the 29 evaluable patients was 21%. The disease control rate was 83%. The safety data obtained from all 42 patients was consistent with the results from previous clinical trials of derazantinib. 
CORPORATE PARTNERSHIPS 
 Basilea Pharmaceutica Ltd. 
 In April 2018, we entered into a License Agreement with Basilea pursuant to which ArQule granted Basilea an exclusive license to develop and commercialize derazantinib in the United States, European Union, Japan and the rest of the world, excluding Greater China. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $10 million and are eligible for up to $326 million in regulatory and commercial milestones. Upon commercialization, we are entitled to receive staggered royalties on future net sales of derazantinib ranging from the high-single digits to the mid-teens on direct sales and mid-single digits to low-double digits on indirect sales. Basilea will be responsible for all costs and expenses of development, manufacture and commercialization in its territory. Under certain circumstances, we may have the opportunity to promote derazantinib in the United States directly. 
Sinovant Sciences Ltd. 
 In February 2018, we entered into a License Agreement with Sinovant pursuant to which ArQule granted Sinovant an exclusive license to develop and commercialize derazantinib in Greater China. The agreement provides for an upfront payment to ArQule of $3 million and a $2.5 million development milestone that was paid in the first quarter of 2019. We are also eligible for up to an additional $82 million in regulatory and sales milestones. Upon commercialization, we are entitled to receive double digit royalties in the low teens from Sinovant on net sales of derazantinib in Greater China. Sinovant will be responsible for all costs and expenses of development, manufacture and commercialization in Greater China. 
PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS 
 We rely principally on patent and trade secret protection for our intellectual property, both in the United States and other countries. While many patent applications have been filed in the United States, the European Union and other foreign countries with respect to our product candidates, many of these have not yet been issued or allowed. The patent positions of companies in the biotechnology industry and the pharmaceutical industry are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims, if any, that may be allowed under any of our patent applications, or the enforceability of any of our issued patents. 
 Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 
 As and when needed to support our current or future research and development programs, we may from time to time obtain rights under patents and other intellectual property owned by other parties through permanent or limited duration licenses or assignments of relevant intellectual property. These may include exclusive and nonexclusive licenses from medical and academic institutions and industry sources as well as generally available commercial licenses. For our current clinical and research programs, we are not a party to any material intellectual property agreement under which we could lose access to a technology necessary to continue research and development of our products if we failed to fulfill our obligations thereunder. We anticipate that we will continue to seek intellectual property rights from external sources where the applicable technology complements our research and development efforts. 
 For our BTK program, we have issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We have one issued patent in the U.S. covering the composition of matter of ARQ 531 and pharmaceutical composition comprising ARQ 531. The expiration date of this patent is December 23, 2035. 

 11

  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
 We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions covering analogs of ARQ 531. If these applications are issued as patents, they will expire in August 2037. In addition, we have a pending U.S. application covering solid forms of ARQ 531. Patents that result from this application will expire in August 2039. 
 With respect to our AKT program, we have issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States, the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions. For miransertib (ARQ 092), we have five issued patents in the United States covering the composition of matter of ARQ 092 and pharmaceutical composition comprising ARQ 092, polymorphs of ARQ 092 and its mesylate salt, processes of manufacturing ARQ 092, and the composition of matter of analogs of ARQ 092. These patents will expire between December 2031 and April 2035. We also have granted patents in the European Union, Japan and other foreign jurisdictions covering ARQ 092. These patents will expire between December 2030 and April 2035. For ARQ 751, we have two issued patents in the United States covering the composition of matter of ARQ 751 and analogs of ARQ 751 and pharmaceutical composition comprising ARQ 751 or analogs of ARQ 751. These patents will expire in June 2032. We also have granted patents in the European Union, Japan and other foreign jurisdictions covering ARQ 751. These patents will expire in June 2032. In addition, we have one issued patent in the United States covering methods of using ARQ 092 or ARQ 751, which will expire in September 2035. Moreover, we have a pending U.S. application covering pharmaceutical combinations comprising ARQ 092 or ARQ 751. Patents that result from this application will expire in November 2039. 
 With respect to derazantinib (ARQ 087), which we have partnered with Basilea and Sinovant, we have four issued patents in the United States covering the composition of matter of ARQ 087 and pharmaceutical composition comprising ARQ 087, solid forms of ARQ 087, and processes of manufacturing ARQ 087. These patents will expire between January 2031 and December 2036. We also have granted patents in the European Union, Japan and other foreign jurisdictions covering ARQ 087. These patents will expire in December 2029. Furthermore, our discovery of small molecule kinase inhibitors has led us to file numerous composition of matter patent applications in various countries. 
 COMPETITION 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive and characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation. We face intense competition from organizations such as large pharmaceutical companies, companies and academic and research organizations. The major pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations competing with us have greater capital resources, larger overall research and development staff and facilities and considerably more experience in drug development and commercialization. Consequently, we face competition on several fronts, including: 
 •

 for collaborators and investors; 
 ​
 •

 for recruitment and retention of highly qualified scientific and management personnel; 
 ​
 •

 for qualified subjects for our clinical studies of our product candidates, which may result in longer and more costly clinical trials; 
 ​
 •

 with competitors’ drugs that may result in effective, commercially successful treatments for the same cancers we target; and 
 ​
 •

 for partners to co-develop and advance our product candidates through all stages of development. 
 ​
 In the area of small molecule anti-cancer therapeutics, we have identified a number of companies that have clinical development programs and focused research and development in small molecule approaches to cancer, including: AbbVie Inc., Amgen, Inc., Astellas Pharma, Inc., Array BioPharma Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Celgene Corporation, Curis, Inc., Exelixis, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Incyte Corporation, Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Johnson and Johnson, Merck, Merck KGaA, Novartis AG, Pfizer, Inc., Principia Biopharma, Inc., the Roche Group, Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., and many others. 
 With respect to ARQ 531, we are aware of a number of companies that are or may be pursuing different approaches to C481S-mutant BTK inhibition, including Aptose Biosciences Inc., Roche and Sunesis Pharmaceuticals. Moreover, numerous companies are also pursuing inhibitors of wild-type BTK, 

 12

  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
 including AbbVie with its drug, IMBRUVICA, and AstraZeneca with its drug, CALQUENCE. Other companies with BTK inhibitors currently in development include Astra Zeneca, BeiGene Co., Ltd., Merck KGaA, Eli Lilly, Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline, Principia Biopharma and others. Other approved drugs that may compete to treat ibrutinib refractory patients, including patients with C481S-mutant BTK, include AbbVie’s Bcl-2 inhibitor, VENCLEXTA, and Verastem Oncology’s COPIKTRA. 
 With respect to miransertib (ARQ 092) in rare diseases, we believe Roche is developing taselisib for PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Syndromes (PROS). Regarding miransertib in oncology, we are aware of a number of companies that are or may be pursuing different approaches to AKT inhibition, including Astra Zeneca, Bayer, Eli Lilly, Merck, Novartis, Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Roche. Moreover, numerous companies are pursuing inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR, two kinases in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. These drugs include Idelalisib, an approved PI3K inhibitor, and Everolimus, Temsirolimus and Rapamycin, each of which are approved mTOR inhibitors. 
 With respect to derazantinib (ARQ 087), we are aware of a number of companies that are or may be pursuing FGFR inhibition, including Astra Zeneca, Bayer, BioClin Therapeutics, Debiopharm Group, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Eisai Co., Ltd., Five Prime Therapeutics, Incyte, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer, Principia Biopharma, Servier and Taiho Oncology. With respect to iCCA, our lead indication for derazantinib, we are aware of a number of companies with products under development, including Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceutical, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Cellact Pharma Gmbh, Concordia Healthcare, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd., Delcath Systems, Inc., Exelixis, InCyte, Novartis, Oncotherapy Services, Inc. and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 There can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop more effective or more affordable products or technology or achieve earlier product development and commercialization than ArQule, thus rendering our technologies and/or products obsolete, uncompetitive or uneconomical. 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 Virtually all pharmaceutical and biotechnology products that we or our collaborators develop will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. The nature and the extent to which these regulations apply vary depending on the nature of the products. In particular, human pharmaceutical products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures by the FDA or the applicable regulatory authorities in countries other than the United States. Various federal and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing of these products. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations are time consuming and require substantial resources, and the outcome of these regulatory activities is uncertain. 
United States Government Regulation 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 •

 completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and other applicable regulations; 
 ​
 •

 submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials in the United States may begin; 
 ​
 •

 performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (GCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its intended use; 
 ​
 •

 submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA); 
 ​
 •

 satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product will be produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP); and 
 ​
 •

 FDA review and approval of the NDA.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Preclinical and Clinical Studies 
 Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Preclinical or nonclinical testing typically continues even after the IND is submitted. 
 An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Upon effectiveness of the IND, the product candidate can then be studied in human clinical trials to determine if the drug candidate is safe and effective. These clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years and are expensive. These three phases, which are subject to considerable regulation, are as follows: 
 •

  Phase 1. The product candidate initially is introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some drug candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the drug candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients; 
 ​
 •

  Phase 2. Clinical trials are initiated in a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and 
 ​
 •

  Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the drug candidate and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling. 
 ​
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the healthy volunteers or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently in other situations, including the occurrence of serious adverse events. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific time-frames to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 FDA Review Process 
 The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product candidate. The FDA reviews each NDA submitted to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts it for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. 
 Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is GMP-compliant to assure and preserve the drug candidate’s identity, 

 14

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product candidate is manufactured and tested. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 The FDA may require, as a condition of approval, restricted distribution and use, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising or commitments to conduct additional research post-approval. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form. A complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The complete response letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 Expedited Review and Approval 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. The receipt of any of the following designations does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 The FDA may grant “fast track” designation to products that treat serious diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Fast track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product’s development plan and, in certain cases, rolling review of an NDA, which allows submission of individually completed sections of an NDA for FDA review before the entire submission is completed. Fast track designation does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval. 
 The FDA may grant “accelerated approval” to products that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. For accelerated approval, the product must have an effect on a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor is typically required to conduct additional post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe the clinical benefit. These studies are known as “confirmatory trials.” Approval of a drug may be withdrawn or the labeled indication of the drug changed if these trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug. 
 The “breakthrough therapy” designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, robust FDA-sponsor interaction and communication can help to identify the most efficient and expeditious path for clinical development, which may help minimize the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. 
 The FDA may grant “priority review” status to products that, if approved, would provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. Priority review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review an NDA, with the goal to take action on the application within six months, compared to ten months for a standard review. 
 Post-Marketing Requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with GMP, complying with promotion and advertising 

 15

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with GMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with GMP. These manufacturers must comply with GMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from GMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP and other laws. The discovery of violations, including failure to conform to GMP, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including recall of the affected product. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. 
 If a product candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years following marketing approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the protected orphan product through a demonstration of either greater effectiveness, greater safety or a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor first obtains approval of an orphan-designated drug that is considered the “same drug” (as defined by the FDA) for the same orphan indication. 
 Patent Term Restoration 
 Upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an IND for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. 
 If the FDA approves, pursuant to an NDA, a drug product that contains an active moiety not previously approved in an NDA (an NCE), the new product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. This exclusivity blocks the FDA from accepting for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA for a drug with the same active moiety, except that an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. Approval of an NDA or NDA supplement (sNDA) for a drug that does not qualify for NCE exclusivity may qualify for a 3-year period of “changes” exclusivity, provided approval of the NDA or sNDA is based on one or more new clinical studies conducted, or sponsored by the applicant, that the FDA considers 

 16

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 essential to approval of the NDA or sNDA. This 3-year exclusivity only blocks the approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs with the same active moiety for the protected change for which the clinical study or studies were essential. If, in response to a written request from the FDA, an NDA applicant conducts one or more clinical studies of a drug in pediatric populations, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days a drug’s unexpired regulatory exclusivities and listed patents which, on the date the FDA accepts the sponsor’s completed study reports, have at least nine months left until expiration. 
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program 
 Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, the FDA may award a priority review voucher to the sponsor of an approved NDA for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric disease. The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application. A voucher may be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application. A rare pediatric disease product application is an NDA for a product that treats or prevents a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years. In general, the disease must affect fewer than 200,000 such individuals in the U.S. In addition, certain other conditions must be met, including the following: the NDA must be deemed eligible for priority review, the NDA must not seek approval for a different adult indication (i.e., for a different disease/​condition), the product must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved by the FDA, and the NDA must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population. Before NDA approval, the FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease, but such designation is not required to receive a voucher. 
 To receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, a sponsor must notify the FDA, upon submission of the NDA, of its intent to request a voucher. If the FDA determines that the NDA is a rare pediatric disease product application, and if the NDA is approved, the FDA will award the sponsor of the NDA a voucher upon approval of the NDA. The FDA may revoke a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within 365 days of the product’s approval. The voucher, which is transferable to another sponsor, may be submitted with a subsequent NDA and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA. The sponsor submitting the priority review voucher must notify the FDA of its intent to submit the voucher with the NDA at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA and must pay a priority review user fee in addition to any other required user fee. 
 Companion Diagnostic Development and Approval 
 For some clinical candidates for which there is a valid predictive biomarker, a diagnostic test known as a companion diagnostic may need to be developed and cleared or approved in parallel with the drug in order to identify patients who are likely to respond favorably to the drug or identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious adverse reactions as a result of treatment with the drug. In the United States companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices, and as such, require either clearance or approval prior to commercialization. The level of risk combined with available controls to mitigate risk determines whether a companion diagnostic device requires Premarket Approval Application (PMA) approval or is cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process. We expect the diagnostic tests being developed for our product candidates will likely be subject to the PMA approval process. 
Other Healthcare Laws 
 In developing and commercializing our drug product candidates, we may also be subject to various other federal and state laws, including fraud and abuse laws and privacy laws. Laws to which we could be subject include, but are not limited to the following: 
 •

  Anti-Kickback Statute: prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchasing, ordering, leasing, arranging for, or recommending the purchasing, ordering, or leasing of, any good or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid; 
 ​

​
  17

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 •

  False Claims Act: the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, false or fraudulent claims for payment or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
 ​
 •

  HIPAA: HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters, and apply regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private); 
 ​
 •

  HIPAA and HITECH: HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which impose obligations on HIPAA covered entities and their business associates, including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to maintain the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information 
 ​
 •

  Transparency Requirements: the federal physician transparency requirements known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and similar states laws, which requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biological and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or State Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
 ​
 •

  Analogous State, Local and Foreign Laws: analogous state, local and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader than similar federal laws, can apply to claims involving health care items or services regardless of payor, including commercial insurers, and are enforced by many different federal and state agencies as well as through private actions. 
 ​
 Foreign Regulation 
 We conduct clinical trials and market our products in numerous jurisdictions outside the United States. Most of these jurisdictions have clinical trial, product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the United States. Thus, whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we can commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
European Union Review and Approval 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications (MAA) under a centralized, decentralized or national procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicines including those produced by biotechnology processes, or those medicines intended to treat certain diseases such as AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes, or for orphan medicinal products, and is optional for those medicines that contain a new active substance, or where the product is highly innovative. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MAA that is valid for all European Union member states. This MAA is issued by the European Commission based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). 
 In addition to the centralized procedure, the European Union has a nationalized procedure, which requires a separate application to and approval determination by each country; a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous assessment 

 18

  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
 and approval in those countries involved in the procedure; and a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants that already have an authorization for the E.U. market can submit further applications for additional countries to recognize that initial authorization. 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MAA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the European Union member states make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 European Union Exclusivity 
 In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon grant of an MAA, and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if applicable, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing a company’s data in order to assess a generic application for eight years. After this time, generic MAAs can be submitted, however, the additional two years of market exclusivity means that the product cannot be placed on the market until the expiry of such additional two-year period. 
 The European Commission, assisted by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
