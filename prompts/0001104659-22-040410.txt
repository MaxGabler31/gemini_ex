Item 1.Business
Introductory Note
The following describes the business of System1, Inc. Except where otherwise noted, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “SST,” or the “Company,” are to System1, Inc.
Description of Business
System1 operates an omnichannel customer acquisition platform, delivering high-intent customers to our advertisers and to our own subscription products. Our proprietary responsive acquisition marketing platform, or RAMP, has 3 primary components. First, RAMP utilizes machine learning to identify and direct marketing campaigns to potential customers across major advertising networks. Second, once these potential intent-driven customers respond to or interact with our marketing efforts, RAMP directs them to our network of over 40 owned and operated websites which is focused on further qualifying customer purchase intent and providing us with first party intent data. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, our websites which include leading search engines like info.com and Startpage.com and digital media sites and utilities such as HowStuffWorks, MapQuest and Wallet Genius, received an average of 185 million visits per month in the aggregate. Third, after potential customers reach our websites and we further qualify their purchase or

consumer intent, RAMP enables us to monetize these customers by delivering advertisements either provided by our advertisers or advertising networks or for our own proprietary subscription products.
RAMP. Our RAMP technology platform is the key to our business success, and expanding and scaling its capabilities has been the focus of our software development, engineering efforts and acquisitions since our inception. Operating across a wide variety of major advertising networks, RAMP identifies potential customers, qualifies their purchase intent and then monetizes these customers through our relationships with advertisers and advertising networks. RAMP also allows advertising platforms and publishers, which we refer to as our network partners, to direct user traffic to our websites or our advertising solutions, which we then monetize on their behalf for a share of revenue generated. RAMP powers our network of owned and operated websites and will, following the Business Combination, power our subscription products.
Through RAMP, we process over 15 million advertising campaign optimizations and ingest 5 billion rows of data across over 50 advertising verticals on a daily basis. RAMP enables us to efficiently monetize user intent by linking data on consumer engagement, such as first party search data, with data regarding monetization and advertising spend. This context-enriched data, combined with our proprietary and data science driven algorithms, creates a closed-loop system that is not reliant on personally identifiable information or information obtained through third-party cookies, but which allows RAMP to efficiently match consumer demand with the appropriate advertiser or advertising experience across advertising verticals in order to yield optimized returns.
Our advertising channels. RAMP operates across a variety of advertising channels. The advertising networks we work with range from the largest established networks like Google and Facebook to newer but growing networks like Taboola, Snap and Outbrain. We regularly evaluate add new advertising networks as they achieve scale.
We monetize customers across a range of over 50 major advertising verticals including health, subscription, finance, insurance, business and technology, travel, auto, and other direct-to-consumer businesses. We believe our ability to efficiently acquire customers across a wide range of advertising verticals is a key differentiator of our business. In the increasingly complex and fast-evolving marketplace of digital marketing, changing consumer demand is dictated by temporal and cyclical factors and personal preferences. Our ability to shift RAMP’s focus to match customer demand insulates our business from shifts in the economic cycle or changes in customer demand. Our advertisers and advertising networks comprise over 100 companies and include top brands and large global advertising networks such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo!.
In connection with the Business Combination, we combined S1 Holdco with Protected, a company that markets and distributes a downloadable subscription consumer security and privacy software called TotalAV. Launched in 2016, Protected UK had 2.3 million paying subscribers as of December 31, 2021, and the business has grown to revenue of $144.6 million in 2021. In late 2018, we acquired a majority interest in Protected.net Group Limited, a private limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales and the current operating subsidiary of Protected ("Protected UK"), and subsequently sold this interest to a group of investors led by System1 and Protected's existing management in the fourth quarter of 2020. Protected’s downloadable software provides real-time antivirus protection, a safe-browsing / VPN feature, adblocking, identity-theft protection, blocking of malicious websites and data breach monitoring. The need for Protected’s products is more critical than ever in today’s increasingly digital world, where people’s information is increasingly vulnerable to digital attacks. This is more evident and necessary as people continue to transition to remote work from home environments, conduct virtual meetings and actively engage in online gaming, streaming, shopping, telemedicine and other daily online transactions. Protected stands between today’s cyber-criminals and its global subscriber bases’ digital profiles, helping secure their personal and financial information and critical technology, including devices, identities and online privacy. We believe that Protected’s software will seamlessly integrate with our platform, and we expect it to be the first of several online subscription products/services where customer acquisition is powered by RAMP.
Strategy
We believe RAMP can be efficiently deployed across the quickly evolving and rapidly expanding digital advertising market. As the total available market for digital advertising expands, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver superior results and performance to advertisers and our network partners through our extensive relationships with leading advertisers and advertising networks, and to better match consumers with the products or services that match their intent.

Our goal is to continue to improve and extend the scope of RAMP by continuing to evolve and adapt to the ever changing landscape of new sources of online user traffic, better monetization tools and growing areas of advertising demand. To achieve this goal, we intend to continue to grow our business by pursuing the following growth strategies:
Grow Existing Business Lines. We plan to expand the number of advertising partners that are utilizing or integrated with RAMP by continuing to attract and monetize users with commercial intent to our owned and operated web properties in high value vertical consumer categories. We will also continue to monetize users on behalf of our network partners.
Expand Our Direct to Advertiser Business. While we intend to continue to grow and deepen our relationships with our third party advertisers and advertising networks, we believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our direct to advertiser relationships, both organically and via strategic acquisitions.
Expand Our Subscription Product Offerings. We believe identifying new customers for our current subscription product, TotalAV, will demonstrate the power of applying RAMP to downloadable and similar subscription offerings, as we optimize to maximize return on advertising spend and increase the lifetime value of our subscribers. We plan to release new subscription product offerings and use RAMP to acquire and monetize subscribers through these new and enhanced products.
Continue Executing Strategic Acquisitions. We believe we are operating in a target-rich environment for strategic acquisitions that will enhance RAMP and add to our portfolio of owned and operated websites and subscription offerings. By continuing to execute on our successful track-record of identifying, evaluating, executing and integrating M&A targets, we believe that we will be able to continue plugging new acquisitions into our overall business strategy to enhance RAMP and expand the diversity and scope of our owned and operated properties.
Grow internationally. We plan to selectively expand our business to international markets over time. In the year ended December 31, 2021, 19% of advertiser spend on our platform came from outside the United States, compared to 8% in the prior year. We believe that we can expand into these new markets by investing in native language resources and continuing to invest in RAMP.

Our websites cover a diverse range of consumer demand and traffic. For example, MapQuest is a web-based navigation software that delivers turn-by-turn direction services to users. Info.com is a metasearch engine that consumers can use to search for relevant information. HowStuffWorks is a commercial website focused on helping people solve problems in their daily lives by using various types of digital media to easily breakdown and explain complex concepts, terminology and mechanisms. Startpage is the world’s most private search engine, allowing our users to browse and search the internet in complete privacy.

Protected’s online subscription consumer security and privacy software, TotalAV, provides award-winning antivirus protection to its users by scanning, locating, quarantining and eliminating viruses, trojans, adware, spyware, ransomware and similar malicious actors in real-time. In addition to scheduled antivirus scans, TotalAV offers a website extension powered by an extensive database of known malicious phishing URLs designed to steal and harvest personal data in order to block phishing URLs, as well as remote firewall access. TotalAV also provides enhanced performance as computers slow down over time by identifying specific errors and programs which impact device performance. Protected’s SafeBrowsing (VPN) product encrypts users’ browsing data, ensures secure connections when users connect to public WiFi, and allows access to otherwise geo-restricted websites. TotalAV WebShield is an extension that detects and safely redirects searches away from websites that may pose a threat to a user’s system. Protected also has an ad blocking product, Total Adblock, which is a plug-in that allows users to experience a cleaner browsing experience. It eliminates pop-ups, banners and video ads, which improves page load times, and blocks third-party trackers to protect users’ privacy and information.
Pre-Business Combination
On January 27, 2022 (the “Closing Date”) the Company completed the previously announced business combination (the “Business Combination”) pursuant to that certain business combination agreement, as amended on November 30, 2021, January 10, 2022 and January 25, 2022, by and among S1 Holdco, System1 SS Protect Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Protected” and, together with S1 Holdco, the “Companies” or “Old System1”), and the other parties signatory thereto. Prior to the Closing Date and in connection with the Business Combination, Trebia filed a notice of deregistration with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies, together with the necessary accompanying documents, and filed a certificate of incorporation and a certificate of corporate domestication with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, under which Trebia was domesticated and continues as a Delaware corporation, while also changing its name to “System1, Inc.” (the “Domestication”).
Prior to the Domestication, the Company was a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on February 11, 2020. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
Related Agreements
Tax Receivable Agreement
Concurrently with the completion of the Business Combination, System1 entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with S1 Holdco and the holders of S1 Holdco Class B Units (the “TRA Holders”). The parties agreed to structure the Business Combination in this manner to permit certain holders of S1 Holdco Class B Units to continue to realize tax benefits, if any, associated with their ownership in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as to provide potential future tax benefits, if any, to System1. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, System1 provided 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that System1 actually realizes, or in certain circumstances (e.g., an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement), the present value of potential future tax benefits (calculated using certain assumptions) to each such TRA Holder, as a result of (i) System1’s direct and indirect allocable share of certain tax basis adjustments resulting from the Business Combination and as a result of future sales or exchanges of S1 Holdco Class B Units for shares of System1 Class A Common Stock (or, at the election of System1, cash) after the Business Combination and (ii) System1’s utilization of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
Actual tax benefits realized by System1 may differ from the tax benefits calculated under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of the use of certain assumptions in the Tax Receivable Agreement, including the use of an assumed weighted-average state and local income tax rate to calculate tax benefits. The payment obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement is an obligation of System1 and not of S1 Holdco. The material terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement are described in the section of the proxy statement/prospectus on Form S-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 23, 2021 (the “Proxy Statement/Prospectus”) beginning on page 141 titled “The Business Combination Proposal-Summary of the Related Agreements-Tax Receivable Agreement.” Such description is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which is included as Exhibit 10.4 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference.

Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the Market Value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited consolidated financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates does not equal or exceed $250.0 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues did not equal or exceed $100.0 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates did not equal or exceed $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our consolidated financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.
