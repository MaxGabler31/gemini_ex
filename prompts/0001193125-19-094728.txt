Introduction 
 We are a blank check company incorporated on March 15, 2016 as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (Business Combination). We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a shell company as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. 
 Our Public Offering closed on September 21, 2016. Prior to our Public Offering, on April 11, 2016, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 5,750,000 Class F ordinary shares (Founder Shares) for an aggregate 
 
1 


  purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share. In August 2016, the Company repurchased 99,000 Founder Shares from our Sponsor at their original per share issuance price and subsequently issued such number of Founder Shares pursuant to The 2016 Share Award Plan of the Company (the Plan) for the same per share price to certain individuals who would be assisting us in the evaluation of investment opportunities. In September 2016, our Sponsor transferred 30,000 Founder Shares to each of the Companys independent directors at their original per share issue price. On September 15, 2016, we effected a pro rata share capitalization resulting in an increase in the total number of Founder Shares outstanding from 5,750,000 to 6,250,000 in order to maintain the ownership of Founder Shares by our initial shareholders, including our Sponsor, independent directors and individuals assisting us with the evaluation of investment opportunities who were granted Founder Shares under the Plan (collectively, the Initial Shareholders), at 20% of our issued and outstanding shares upon consummation of the Public Offering. Following the pro rata share capitalization and the closing of the Public Offering, our Sponsor held 6,044,570 Founder Shares, each of our three independent directors held 32,610 Founder Shares and the individuals assisting us with the evaluation of investment opportunities, including our executive officers, who were originally granted Founder Shares under the Plan, held 107,600 Founder Shares. On March 16, 2017, concurrent with Mr. Bruce Rosenblums resignation from our board of directors, the Company acquired 25,100 Founders Shares from Mr. Rosenblum and concurrent therewith, in connection with Mr. Casey Wassermans appointment to the board of directors, the Company re-issued such 25,100 Founders Shares to Mr. Casey Wasserman, and our Sponsor sold to Mr. Wasserman an additional 7,500 Founders Shares and thereafter our Sponsor held 6,037,070 Founders Shares. On June 26, 2017, the Company entered into agreements to repurchase 6,520 Founder Shares at the initial purchase price, for the total sum of $24, from two individuals no longer providing services to the Company. The repurchase was consummated in July 2017, at which time such shares were treated as cancelled, reducing the number of issued and outstanding Founder Shares to 6,243,480, and reducing the number of Founder Shares held collectively by individuals previously awarded Founder Shares under the Plan from 107,600 to 101,080. 
 On the Close Date, we consummated our Public Offering of 25,000,000 units (which included the purchase of 1,500,000 units subject to the underwriters 1,500,000 unit over-allotment option) at a price of $10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds of $250,000,000 before underwriting discounts and expenses. Each unit (Unit) consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-half of one warrant of the Company (Warrant). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share. Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 7,000,000 warrants to our Sponsor (the Private Placement Warrants), each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant. 
 We received gross proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants of $250,000,000 and $7,000,000, respectively, for an aggregate of $257,000,000. $250,000,000 of the gross proceeds were deposited in a trust account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (Trustee) acting as trustee (the Trust Account). At the Close Date, $5,000,000 of the remaining amount was used to pay underwriting discounts and $250,000 of the remaining amount was used to repay notes payable to our Sponsor, with the balance reserved to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. In the future, a portion of interest income on the funds held in the Trust Account may be released to us to pay tax obligations. At December 31, 2018, funds held in the Trust Account consisted solely of money market funds. On November 4, 2016, we announced that, commencing November 7, 2016, holders of the Units sold in our Public Offering may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and Warrants included in the Units. Those Units not separated continued to trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol SCACU, and the Class A ordinary shares and Warrants that were separated traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols SCAC and SCACW, respectively. We did not issue fractional warrants upon separation of the Units and only whole Warrants traded. 
 On March 12, 2018, we issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (as amended on September 21, 2018, the Sponsor Convertible Note), pursuant to which we may borrow up to $1,000,000 from our Sponsor 
 
2 


  from time to time. The Sponsor Convertible Note bears interest at a rate of 1.96% per annum and all unpaid principal under the Sponsor Convertible Note including accrued interest thereon will be due and payable in full on the earliest of (i) March 31, 2019, (ii) the effective date of an initial Business Combination, and (iii) the termination, for any reason, of the Business Combination Agreement (as defined below) (such earliest date, the Maturity Date). Our Sponsor will have the option to convert any amounts outstanding under the Sponsor Convertible Note, up to $1,000,000 in the aggregate, into warrants to purchase Class A ordinary shares at a conversion price of $1.00 per warrant. The terms of such warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants, including that each such warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to the same adjustments applicable to the Private Placement Warrants. Under the Sponsor Convertible Note, our Sponsor has waived any and all right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any distribution of or from the trust account, including any right to seek recourse, reimbursement, payment or satisfaction for any claim against the Trust Account. The issuance of the Sponsor Convertible Note was approved by our board of directors and our audit committee on March 12, 2018. On March 12, 2018, we borrowed $500,000 under the Sponsor Convertible Note and on August 2, 2018, we borrowed the remaining $500,000 under the Sponsor Convertible Note. 
 On September 26, 2018, we issued an unsecured promissory note (as amended, the Sponsor Note) pursuant to which we may borrow up to $1.5 million from Sponsor. The Sponsor Note bears interest at a rate of 2.51% per annum and all unpaid principal under the Sponsor Note including accrued interest thereon will be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date, unless accelerated upon the occurrence of customary events of default. Under the Sponsor Note, our Sponsor has waived any and all right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any distribution of or from the trust account established in connection with our initial public offering, including any right to seek recourse, reimbursement, payment or satisfaction for any claim against the Trust Account. The issuance of the Sponsor Note was approved by our board of directors and our audit committee on September 13, 2018. Executed on September 26, 2018, $500,000 was drawn under the Sponsor Note on October 5, 2018, $500,000 was also drawn under the Sponsor Note on November 12, 2018. 
 We and our Sponsor are currently evaluating the treatment of the Sponsor Convertible Note and Sponsor Note given our planned dissolution described below. 
 On September 18, 2018, we held an extraordinary general meeting at which our shareholders approved (1) an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which we must (a) consummate a business combination, (b) cease our operations except for the purpose of winding up if we fail to complete such Business Combination, and (c) redeem all of our Class A ordinary shares included as part of the units sold in the initial public offering from September 21, 2018 to December 31, 2018 (or March 31, 2019 if we executed a definitive agreement for an initial Business Combination by December 31, 2018 and all closing conditions contained in such definitive agreement (other than regulatory conditions, including, without limitation, those related to antitrust approval and the effectiveness of any related registration statement, and conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of such Business Combination) had been satisfied or waived by December 31, 2018) (such date, the Extension Date); and (2) a related amendment to the investment management trust agreement governing the Trust Account to extend the date before which we must complete a Business Combination to the Extension Date and extend the date on which the trustee must liquidate the trust account from September 21, 2018 to the Extension Date. In connection with the Extension Amendment on September 18, 2018, $39.15 million was released from the trust account to satisfy the Extension Amendment Redemptions. 
 On September 13, 2018, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with Panavision Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our direct wholly owned subsidiary (Panavision Acquisition Sub), Sim Acquisition Sub, Inc., an Ontario corporation and our direct wholly owned subsidiary (Sim Acquisition Sub), Panavision Inc., a Delaware corporation (Panavision), Sim Video International Inc., an Ontario corporation (Sim), and the other parties thereto, as amended on December 11, 2018 (as amended, the Business Combination Agreement). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, among other things, it was 
 
3 


  proposed that Panavision and SIM would become our direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Panavision/SIM Business Combination). 
 Due to market conditions, delays resulting from the recent partial U.S. government shutdown and our March 31, 2019 termination date, we, Panavision, Sim, the Panavision Holder Representative (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) and the Sim Holder Representative (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) jointly determined to terminate the Business Combination Agreement pursuant to a Termination Agreement, dated as of February 28, 2019, by and among such parties, effective as of such date. We did not pay any costs or fees in connection with the Termination Agreement. 
 As a result of the termination of the Business Combination Agreement, effective as of February 28, 2019, the Business Combination Agreement was of no further force or effect, and each of the following agreements entered into in connection with the Business Combination Agreement was automatically terminated with no further force or effect: (1) the subscription agreements we entered into with certain investors, pursuant to which, among other things, such investors committed to subscribe for our shares for an aggregate amount of $55.0 million, $30.0 million of which was to be funded by Saban Sponsor II LLC (the Sponsor PIPE Entity), an affiliate of our Sponsor, (2) the Debt Commitment Letter we entered into with Bank of America, N.A., Bank of Montreal and ING Capital LLC, pursuant to which, among other things, such potential lenders committed to provide a $250.0 million ABL revolving credit facility, (3) the Debt Commitment Letter we entered into with Solus Alternative Asset Management LP, pursuant to which, among other things, such lender committed to provide a $100.0 million second lien term loan credit facility, (4) the Director Composition and Standstill Agreement we entered into with our Sponsor, the Sponsor PIPE Entity, the Principal Panavision Holders (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) and the Panavision Holder Representative, pursuant to which, among other things, certain post-closing governance rights for the combined company were agreed upon and the parties agreed to take certain actions in connection with, or to facilitate, the Business Combination, and (5) the employment agreements we entered into with Kimberly Snyder and Bill Roberts. 
 As a result of the termination of the Business Combination Agreement and the March 31, 2019 deadline for the Company to consummate a Business Combination, pursuant to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, we (1) have ceased all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (2) intend to redeem all of our issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares (the Public Shares), at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, on April 1, 2019, and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, expect to liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
 There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants and Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless upon the liquidation of the Company. 
 Our Initial Shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares. However, if our Initial Shareholders own Public Shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares. 
 Our Initial Shareholders have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares. 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the proceeds held outside the Trust 
 
4 


  Account, although such funds will likely not be sufficient for such purpose. We have requested that the Trustee release to us an additional amount of $50,000 of accrued interest to pay a portion of such costs and expenses. We are in the process of negotiating the payment of costs and expenses owed to third parties. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our Public Offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share and other risk factors described below. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 
 Although we sought to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we did business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Upon redemption of our Public Shares, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.00 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our directors or officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to 
 
5 


  take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share and other risk factors described below. 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. At December 31, 2018, we had access to up to $46,229 from the proceeds of the Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, and loans from our Sponsor, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000). 
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our Company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages. 
 Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account as a result of the proposed redemption of our Public Shares commencing on April 1, 2019. 
 Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that: 
 

 | if our Business Combination is not consummated on or prior to the Extension Date, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the Trust Account; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prior to our Business Combination, we may not issue additional ordinary shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the Trust Account or (ii) vote on any Business Combination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of at least two thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company.

 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Business Combination, we encountered intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. 
Indemnity 
 Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below: (i) $10.00 per Public Share; or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case, net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for its indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. 
Employees 
 We currently have four officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until our liquidation. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 Our Units, Class A ordinary shares and Warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and as a result we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at: http://www.sec.gov. 
 We previously filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We expect to file a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act shortly after the Extension Date. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains consolidated financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer that no longer qualifies as an emerging growth company will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy 
 
7 


  statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the Close Date, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited consolidated financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
