Item 1. Business
Overview
We are the enterprise platform for dynamic work, enabling teams and organizations of all sizes to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work at scale, resulting in more efficient processes and better business outcomes. The nature of work has changed and the majority of work is unstructured or dynamic. The growing volume and variety of information has complicated the process for executing work across teams that are increasingly multidisciplinary and geographically distributed. Unstructured or dynamic work is work that has historically been managed using a combination of email, spreadsheets, whiteboards, phone calls, and meetings to communicate with team members and complete projects and processes. It is frequently changing, often ad-hoc, and highly reactive to new information. Rigid applications, such as ticketing, enterprise resource planning, or customer relationship management systems are poorly suited to manage unstructured work. For nearly 30 years, organizations have primarily relied on disparate and rudimentary tools to manage dynamic or unstructured work. Reliance on these tools limits visibility and accountability, creates information silos that slow decision-making, and results in delays, errors, and suboptimal outcomes.
Business users need technology solutions they can set up and modify on their own. Today, many systems within an enterprise require IT implementation and management. Most tools that focus on the business user require some coding knowledge to incorporate business logic for workflows, integrate data from third-party systems, and adapt to changing business needs.
Smartsheet was founded in 2005 with a vision to build a universal software platform for work execution that does not require coding capabilities. Our platform serves as a single source of truth across work projects, processes, and initiatives, fostering accountability and engagement within teams and leading to more efficient decision-making and better business outcomes. We provide a number of solutions that eliminate the obstacles to capturing information, propelled by a familiar and intuitive interface as well as easily customizable forms. Our reporting and automation capabilities reduce time spent on administration and repetitive work. We make it easy for teams to apply business logic to automate repetitive actions using an extensive list of conditions. Business users, with little or no training, can set up and modify our platform to customize workflows to suit their needs. Our familiar and intuitive user interface and functionality allow users to realize the benefits of our platform without changing the behaviors developed using everyday productivity tools.
People across organizations have similar needs no matter where they work or what they do. They need to manage workflows across teams; gain visibility into progress on company-wide projects, programs, processes, and initiatives in real-time; capture inputs; track and report on deliverables; prioritize actions; and provide consistency in processes. Smartsheet is adaptable to manage virtually any type of work. Our customers use Smartsheet for thousands of documented use cases, including software migration planning, vendor and contract management, brand launches, compliance reporting, event planning, customer onboarding, budget approvals, patent application processing, talent acquisition management, benefit and retirement tracking, sales enablement, pipeline management, sales operations, commissions calculations, marketing programs management, investor relations tracking, and website management, among others.
Our customers are in approximately 190 countries and include 89 companies in the Fortune 100, and over 80% of the companies in the Fortune 500. As of January 31, 2022, our Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 customers had annualized contract values (“ACVs”) ranging from less than $200 to over $3.0 million. Our customers typically begin using our platform for a single initiative, process, or project. Over time, as users realize the benefits of improved execution, adoption of our platform expands horizontally across an organization through new use cases and teams, as well as expands vertically to increasingly sophisticated and mission-critical uses.

We have a blended go-to-market model that allows us to serve a larger, diverse user base without incurring excessive costs. We deliver our cloud-based software platform through a subscription model globally. Our digital sales model enables self-service licensing and adoption through our website. We employ an efficient inside sales team that utilizes machine learning and lead scoring to respond to and convert other interested users within new and existing organizations. We have a targeted field sales team dedicated to expanding our presence within existing enterprise customers where we have identified significant opportunity for growth. We have developed partner relationships to support new customers, use cases, and markets. The breadth of solutions we offer reflects the flexibility our users desire to purchase and use our platform in a way that most closely aligns with their needs and level of adoption.
Our Platform
Our platform is purpose-built to improve work execution for organizations and teams of all sizes. It is designed to scale up to the most demanding enterprise-grade workloads and delivers the scalability, compliance, and security required by the world’s largest organizations. We provide our customers with a robust set of capabilities to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work. Our platform enhances visibility and accountability in work execution and eliminates behaviors and processes that hinder productivity. It is designed to be accessible and valuable to all knowledge workers. Business users with no coding ability can share their work in Smartsheet across internal and external teams, and create and modify workflows to address specific use cases. Our platform offers multiple ways for customers to plan and manage their work using grids, projects, cards, and calendars, and users can easily toggle between views to support their team’s preferred way of working.
We also offer capabilities and functionality to enable teams to accelerate execution while maintaining the flexibility to apply our platform to thousands of documented use cases. Smartsheet Advance provides components that, in combination, enable customers to implement solutions for a specific use case or for large scale projects, initiatives, or processes. Some components are available for standalone purchase, including Connectors, which provide data integration and automation to third-party applications, and premium applications such as Control Center, Dynamic View, Data Shuttle, and Bridge by Smartsheet (“Bridge”). These capabilities are monetized based on the value they create for customers, not on a per seat basis.
Additional subscriptions that can be integrated with our cloud-based platform include Resource Management by Smartsheet (“Resource Management”), a resource planning solution that helps businesses find and schedule appropriate project teams, track and manage time, and forecast hiring needs; and Brandfolder, a digital asset management platform that enables workers to intuitively store, customize, and share creative assets. The combination of Brandfolder and Smartsheet allows our customers to create dynamic solutions to manage workflows around content and collaboration.
Benefits of our Platform
Automation across the organization saves time and minimizes manual processing
We enable users to organize their unstructured work and apply business logic to automate actions that shorten work execution timelines without the need to write code. Business logic is used to determine the conditions under which the following types of automated actions occur: update requests, intake and collection of information, sending of information, notifications, approval requests, and automated actions across systems. These elements of automation reduce errors and time spent by teams on administration.
Real-time visibility drives more informed, faster decision-making
Our platform is designed to provide a single source of truth for all stakeholders. We break down information silos across teams and provide real-time visibility into the status of work and the actions required by each stakeholder. This visibility ensures clear ownership of actions and outcomes. Teams feel empowered to take action, leading to stronger engagement and faster time to completion. Line of business managers benefit from visibility into progress against goals, allowing them to react quickly to real-time information and enabling faster and more informed decision-making.

Content collaboration produces better content, faster
We enable marketing, creative, and other functional teams to easily manage creative production and marketing work, as well as review, deliver, store, share, manipulate, and analyze the content they produce across hundreds of formats. We help global brands create compelling, timely, and consistent brand experiences.
Ease of use enables broad adoption
Our platform is designed for broad adoption within and across organizations for virtually any use case. Users can begin using Smartsheet within minutes and configure our platform for their needs with limited or no training. As of January 31, 2022, we had over 10 million Smartsheet users, including paid licensed users and non-licensed collaborators. Additionally, Advance introduces the concept of connected users who are monetized through this offering and can include both paid licenses and non-licensed collaborators. Our strategy is designed to monetize those seeking to enjoy the complete functionality of our platform or to enjoy tailored experiences while promoting greater usage within and across organizations. Teams and organizations buy into our platform because the productivity benefits derived through visibility and accountability are provided to all stakeholders. All team members can access the latest project information from a single location and can be held accountable without manual effort.
Multiple levels of integration to garner the most benefit from Smartsheet and other systems
We enable business users to engage with our platform through systems they currently use. Through connectors either built by Smartsheet or developed in collaboration with our partners, we extend the reach and consistency of data from other systems, such as those offered by Salesforce, Adobe, UiPath, Workday, DocuSign, Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Microsoft. Beyond these specific connections, the Smartsheet components, Bridge and Data Shuttle, enable customers to connect Smartsheet with most other systems for enhanced reach and cross system data consistency. These data connections, combined with Smartsheet platform capabilities, enable users to apply business logic and automate workflows, increasing the value of these existing applications to our users. We also integrate our platform into popular document and communication applications from Google, Microsoft, Slack, and others. Such functionality enables our users to incorporate documents directly into our platform or access our platform through the application of their choice. In addition, we offer extensible application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that enable a broad ecosystem of partners and customers to integrate directly into our platform, increasing the value of existing custom-built applications and improving the experience for our users.
Enterprise features and functionality for scalable adoption within businesses
Organizations rely on Smartsheet to manage a diverse set of business processes. We provide the scalability, compliance, and security needed to operate reliably for our customers. Our platform provides consistent program execution, enabling teams and organizations to administer programs with management, visibility, and reporting at scale. Customers can use our professional services offerings to create and administer programs for specific use cases. We also provide user management and compliance features that enable organizations to control user access and audit account activity within our platform. We provide enterprise-grade security controls and data governance to enable customer compliance with applicable privacy regulations and data handling requirements.
Our Growth Strategies
Our goal is to make our platform accessible for every organization, team, and worker relying on collaborative work to achieve successful outcomes. We are pursuing this goal with the following strategies.
Attract more customers to Smartsheet
Table of Contents

We believe that there is a broad need for a work execution platform such as ours, and we believe there is significant opportunity to grow our paid user base. We will continue to invest in our digital sales model, direct sales force, brand, product, and partner marketing in order to land new customers and increase enterprise adoption. In addition, we will continue to grow our professional services function, and develop new and enhanced premium solutions based on Smartsheet Advance and our standalone offerings to help land larger accounts and increase the scale of our deployments with customers.
Expand within our existing customer base
Our customers frequently increase their use of our platform as they realize the value they derive from adopting Smartsheet. As a result, we are working with customers to help them define new use cases within existing deployments, and expand usage of Smartsheet to additional teams in their organizations that would benefit from our platform. In addition to broader deployments, we enable our customers to further derive value from Smartsheet through premium solutions such as our Connectors, Control Center, Dynamic View, and Bridge. Our professional services, customer success, and training teams provide our customers with implementation, training, and support services to help them expand their use of, and realize the full benefit of, Smartsheet.
Expand internationally
For the year ended January 31, 2022, we derived approximately 18% of our revenue from customers outside the United States. We believe that there is significant opportunity to acquire new customers internationally and accelerate expansion with our existing international customers. Our platform is available in eight languages. By expanding our direct and indirect sales force focused outside of the United States, establishing international sales territories and global corporate subsidiaries, and partnering with strategic resellers, we plan to continue to grow our international sales. In October 2018, we opened our first international sales office in the U.K. to focus on growing our presence within Western Europe. In September 2019, we established an additional international office in Australia to focus on expanding our position in the Australian market and the Asia Pacific region. In October 2021, we launched Smartsheet Regions and began hosting data in the European Union to meet customer compliance, privacy, and governance requirements. In November 2021, we established a shared services center in Costa Rica to support various functions within the Company.
Expand into government
Smartsheet Gov has achieved Provisional Authority to Operate (“P-ATO”) under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”). This means the Smartsheet platform has been fully approved for use by federal agencies and government contractors, giving them the ability to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work at scale. Additionally, Smartsheet can now be found on the AWS Gov Cloud Marketplace. This marketplace lists FedRAMP authorized offerings to help agencies research and select secure and compliant cloud providers available for federal use. Smartsheet Gov has obtained the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) Impact Level 4 P-ATO per the Security Requirements Guide for cloud computing by the Defense Information Systems Agency. This means that customers within the DoD can also use the Smartsheet Gov platform.
Expand product features and functionality
We intend to continually increase the value we provide to our customers by investing in extending the capabilities of our platform. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in research and development to bolster our existing technology and enhance usability to improve our customers’ productivity. We further place continued emphasis on enterprise management platform features, including account administration, security, and permissioning. 
Make additional investments in partnerships and integrations
Table of Contents

To help drive adoption of Smartsheet and deliver value to our customers, we offer extensive embedded functionality at no cost to complement and enhance the use of the most common productivity tools from providers such as Microsoft, Google, Slack, Box, DocuSign, and Dropbox. We offer powerful out-of-the-box Connectors with Salesforce, Adobe, Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Microsoft that we sell for an additional fee on top of our user-based pricing. We intend to continue to invest in these integrations, develop new partnerships, and enhance our architecture to support a wider range of Connectors with leading enterprise applications to increase the value, awareness, and adoption of our platform.
Pursue strategic acquisitions
We plan to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will be complementary to our existing offering, enhance our technology, and increase the value proposition we deliver to our customers. Our acquisitions of Denver-based Brandfolder and Seattle-based Artefact Product Group, LLC (“10,000ft”) are examples of acquisitions that were complementary to our existing product capabilities. Through our acquisition of Brandfolder, we now offer a solution for digital asset management that allows our customers to create dynamic solutions to manage workflows around content and collaboration. The acquisition of 10,000ft accelerated our time to market for a resource planning software solution.
Our Technology
We believe our collective domain knowledge, technical expertise, and more than a decade of software development experience have allowed us to differentiate our platform from the competition. Our scalable multi-tenant architecture is designed to provide our customers with highly usable, secure, and reliable functionality.
Extensible technology platform
Our solutions are built on a public cloud platform that allows us to leverage shared components and services, enabling us to rapidly develop new features and functionalities on our existing platform without re-architecting the infrastructure. This also enables our products to seamlessly integrate with one another and provide our customers with a better user experience while leveraging our platform. We also offer a broad set of APIs that allow our customers the ability to integrate their Smartsheet account with other systems, or build their own applications on top of our extensible platform.
Integrated mobile capabilities
We have invested in our public cloud framework and mobile development teams to extend the high-performance functionality of our platform to smartphones and tablets. Our native mobile applications are built for both iOS and Android, and are designed to provide similar functionality to our desktop version, while also supporting mobile-first customer use cases.
Enterprise-grade security
Our customers frequently use our platform to store and manage highly-sensitive or proprietary information. We prioritize security in every aspect of our service, from software development to customer experience. Our approach to security includes a comprehensive information security program, governing the processing and security of customer information, and the appropriate physical, organizational, and technical controls designed to ensure the security of customer information collected, accessed, stored, or transmitted to or by Smartsheet. To ensure our controls remain up-to-date, we use external auditors to verify the adequacy of security measures and controls according to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants SOC2 standards as well as the International Organization for Standardization information security management systems standard 27001. In addition, we use external security experts to conduct penetration testing and application security testing at least annually and make these audit and penetration test reports available to customers.

Human Capital
Table of Contents

At Smartsheet, our mission is to empower anyone to drive meaningful change. This starts with our own team. As of January 31, 2022 Smartsheet and its wholly owned subsidiaries employed 2,539 people, with 2,259 in the United States and 280 internationally. Our leadership team is composed of eight executive officers, 25% of whom are women and 37.5% of whom are persons of color.
Engaging our team 
We believe in a culture of empowerment and know that the tenacity, adaptability, and integrity of our employees is our greatest asset. With a vision to be the dynamic platform to empower everyone everywhere to change the way the world works, we are dedicated to investing in and supporting our employees in their achievements.
To ensure we are continuously improving, we regularly conduct confidential surveys to seek feedback from our employees on a variety of topics, including but not limited to, leadership effectiveness and company confidence, competitiveness of our total rewards offerings, career growth opportunities, and work-life fulfillment. The results are shared with employees and reviewed by leadership, who identify areas of progress or opportunity and prioritize actions to drive meaningful change. 
Given the unprecedented events of the past two years, we have continued to closely monitor our employees’ sentiment around the COVID-19 pandemic and Smartsheet’s response. These activities have included pulse surveys, regular updates on a COVID-19 dashboard (powered by Smartsheet), weekly status reports, an ongoing “Ask Me Anything” series with leadership, and a task force dedicated to both crisis management and creating our new norms for our future of work. Our employees’ resilience and agility remains evident in their feedback, where we heard they felt supported during the global pandemic and felt confident in their ability to succeed. We know that connection has been key during this time so we have also hosted a variety of virtual team building, engagement, and well-being workshops and events.
Growth and development
To help our team members succeed, we continually emphasize and invest in talent development and training, provide career pathing, and promote internal mobility opportunities. 
Along with an online learning management system that hosts virtual content ranging from compliance training to security protocols, we subscribe to two separate platforms for continuous learning and professional development, and offer instructor-led training on topics such as leadership and communication. We also support the development of our people leaders through various leadership training opportunities and access to certified coaches. Lastly, our talent management team implemented a new program around quarterly check-ins to encourage more regular conversations between employees and their leaders around their development and career opportunities, as well as to enable and support internal mobility readiness.
Total rewards
We invest in our employees by offering compelling and competitive compensation packages designed to attract, attain, motivate, and reward. Our total rewards packages include base and variable compensation, new hire and retentive stock awards for all eligible roles, an employee stock purchase plan in most jurisdictions, and comprehensive benefits. Our benefit programs are responsive to our geographies, while also providing a consistent focus on comprehensive healthcare, and paid leave for important life events such as welcoming a child. Examples of global benefits include flexible (unlimited) paid time off for exempt employees, paid parental leave, a monthly flex work stipend and additional commuter support, employer retirement contributions, and subsidized child and adult care. We continually assess the current business environment, labor markets, and solicit employee feedback as we work to refine our total rewards packages and ensure they remain compelling and equitable. 
We view well-being as a fundamental part of our employees’ lives, and emphasize this with a robust suite of offerings. We support holistic well-being with our online mental health counseling and well-being services, financial wellness workshops, and a comprehensive wellness dashboard (powered by Smartsheet), which includes resources for employees on a wide range of topics.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion and corporate social responsibility 
We strive to create a culture of belonging that is rooted in respect and opportunity for all people. We believe that by celebrating diverse voices and experiences, and fostering equity for our team, customers, and communities, we enable people to do and be their best. Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) framework centers on culture, people, practices, and markets. We have several working committees, including our Global DEI Committee, which brings together a cross section of the global organization to support and amplify our DEI initiatives, as well as department-specific groups such as our DEI in Marketing Committee. We continue to invest in hiring practices that attract underrepresented talent, including sourcing from diverse universities, specialized conferences, and organizations. We also offer ongoing DEI education at all levels and strive to ensure that we have diverse representation in all that we do, from hiring panels to company meetings and events. Further, we have seven employee resource groups as places for learning and support, such as Black at Smartsheet, Parents & Caregivers, and Rainbow Collab.
At Smartsheet, we are committed to harnessing the power of our people, resources, and technology to support causes that reflect our vision of empowering human achievement. We encourage our employees to volunteer in their communities by offering paid volunteer time off. Additionally, we offer a volunteer rewards program whereby we make a donation in association with an employee’s volunteer time. Each year, we make donations to nonprofit organizations which focus on causes that are meaningful to our business, customers, employees, and communities. We also support nonprofit organizations by offering discount pricing. These nonprofit organizations rely on Smartsheet to improve visibility and accountability, help run mission-oriented organizations, and achieve more. 
Sales and Marketing
Our marketing and sales teams work closely together to provide an easy way for potential users to discover, try, adopt, and expand usage of Smartsheet over time. We include demand generation, customer success, customer support, and professional services under the sales organization to align these efforts to best support our customers.
Marketing
Our marketing organization is responsible for corporate brand reputation and management, increasing awareness and demand for our platform, and fostering our community of users. We target potential users across a wide variety of departments and functions in organizations of all sizes and industries. We employ a range of techniques to increase brand awareness, product interest, and traffic to our website, where we engage prospects throughout the buyer's journey and encourage new users to sign up for a 30-day free trial and purchase our subscription services online. These marketing techniques include advertising, brand marketing, content marketing, search marketing, social marketing, digital marketing, events, communications, and more. We frequently engage with respected industry analyst firms to educate them on the benefits of our platform and accelerate the maturation of an appropriate market category.
We have also built marketing relationships with a number of technology companies, such as Microsoft and Google, to help promote and grow our user base and footprint. These partners offer access to our platform through links on their websites and expand our marketing reach. 
In October 2021, we hosted our annual global customer conference, Smartsheet ENGAGE, to provide current and prospective users a better understanding of our platform through interactions with peers and training, and to highlight customer successes, use cases, and best practices.
Sales
Table of Contents

Our sales organization is responsible for driving customer expansion and new customer opportunities. Our sales force is organized into separate teams focused on new customers, small to medium-sized businesses, large enterprises, geographic regions, and industries. Our assisted sales model relies on machine learning and lead scoring to identify users based on their likelihood to purchase our platform. Further, once we identify an opportunity for meaningful expansion within a customer organization, we can assign a customer success manager and an expansion sales representative to that customer. When an organization reaches a certain level of usage, we typically assign a field sales representative who is focused on growing adoption in these large accounts and expanding usage to a broader set of use cases.
Professional Services
Our professional services team provides our customers with implementation, training, and consulting services to help them realize the full benefits of Smartsheet. Our training programs include a mix of virtual and in-person offerings with different options focused either on helping onboard teams of users quickly or helping individuals achieve certification-level subject matter expertise. Our consulting and solution services teams provide configuration, use case optimization, integration, and process automation services.
Customer Support
Our platform is designed to minimize the need for customer support, as users can easily sign up and begin using it without assistance. We provide significant self-help resources including our extensive help portal and our active online community. Additionally, we provide free support channels for users based on their plan type with additional paid support offerings available. These include ticket submission for all users at no cost, along with access to phone support and subject matter expert appointments as part of our paid plans. We also allocate support team member time to accounts for continuity of care through specialized paid offerings such as Technical Account Managers.
Customers
Our scalable collaborative work management platform helps teams and organizations of all sizes get work done fast and efficiently. As of January 31, 2022, we had domain-based customers with ACVs ranging from less than $200 to over $3.0 million. We define a domain-based customer as an organization with at least one paid user account associated with a unique domain name such as @cisco. An ISP customer is typically a small team or an individual that registers for our services with an email address hosted on a widely used domain such as @gmail, @outlook, or @yahoo.
Our domain-based customers include organizations across virtually all sectors, including aerospace, automotive, biotechnology, consumer, e-commerce, education, finance, government, healthcare, IT services, marketing, media, non-profit, publishing, software, technology, and travel.
Backlog 
The majority of our invoiced customers sign up for subscription terms of one year and are invoiced for the full subscription term upfront. A small subset of customers sign multi-year subscription contracts but receive annual invoicing terms. Another smaller subset of customers with annual contract terms are invoiced on a quarterly or a semi-annual basis. When contract terms exceed invoicing terms, portions of those contracts which at a point in time remain uninvoiced, are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue, or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. Those contracted but uninvoiced amounts are considered by us to be backlog. As of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, we had backlog of approximately $53.9 million and $35.1 million, respectively. As the majority of our contracts are annual, and as invoicing terms on the majority of our contracts are also upfront annual, most of our customer contracts have no impact on backlog and therefore we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.

Research and Development
Our research and development team consists of our engineering, user experience, design, and product management teams. These groups are responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of new technologies and features for our platform. Our research and development team is also responsible for continuous availability, scalability, performance, and security of our platform and maintaining the underlying public cloud infrastructure. We invest substantial resources in research and development to drive core technology innovation and bring new products to market.
Intellectual Property
Smartsheet and its subsidiaries rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions, to protect their intellectual property. As of January 31, 2022, Smartsheet and its subsidiaries held a number of pending patent applications as well as issued and active patents, the latter of which expire between 2022 and 2038 absent any term adjustments or extensions. Additionally, as of January 31, 2022, Smartsheet and its subsidiaries held a number of U.S. and international trademark registrations, as well as pending trademark applications.
These intellectual property protections and applications seek to protect proprietary inventions and marks relevant to Smartsheet’s business. While we believe that in the aggregate these patents, patent applications, trademarks, and trademark applications are important to Smartsheet’s and its subsidiaries’ competitive positions, no single patent, trademark, or application is material. Smartsheet intends to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
Compliance with Government Regulations 
Our business is subject to various U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to data privacy, security and protection, intellectual property, employment and labor, workplace safety, consumer protection, anti-bribery, import and export controls, immigration, federal securities, and tax. Additionally, we may currently or in the future be subject to various laws and regulations relating to the contractual commitments with our customers in heavily regulated industries and the public sector, which could affect how we and our partners do business with such customers. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.
The legal environment of internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the United States and globally. New and evolving laws and regulations, and changes in their enforcement and interpretation, may require changes to our platform, products, services, or business practices, and may significantly increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. As our business expands to include additional products and services, and our operations continue to expand internationally, our compliance requirements may increase, and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. We believe we are currently in material compliance with laws and regulations to which we are subject and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect compliance with these laws and regulations to have a material adverse effect on our business or operations.
Competition
Table of Contents

The market for work execution software is fragmented, increasingly competitive, and subject to rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. We face competition from a number of vendors with a variety of product offerings. Our competitors range in size, from diversified global companies with significant research and development and marketing resources, to smaller startups building on new technology platforms whose narrower offerings may allow them to be more efficient in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Our primary competition remains a combination of manual, email- and spreadsheet-based processes from providers that users have historically relied on to manage work such as Google and Microsoft, who offer a range of productivity solutions. While we currently collaborate with Google and Microsoft, they may develop and introduce, or acquire, products that directly or indirectly compete with our platform. Certain of our features compete with current or potential products and services offered by Airtable, Asana, Atlassian, Citrix, ClickUp, Monday.com, Planview, and others. Larger software vendors with substantial resources and smaller upstarts building on new technology platforms may also decide to enter our market by building or acquiring products that compete with our platform. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•ease of deployment and use of applications;
•product features, quality, and functionality;
•ability to automate multi-step processes;
•ability to integrate with other applications and systems;
•enterprise-grade security, scalability, compliance, and administration capabilities;
•ability to support mission critical workloads at scale;
•vision for the market and product innovation;
•size of customer base and level of user adoption;
•pricing and total cost of ownership;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts;
•brand awareness and reputation; and
•customer experience, including support.
We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on our enterprise-grade capabilities, focus on business user empowerment, and ability to support mission critical workflows at scale. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance and the quality of our platform.
