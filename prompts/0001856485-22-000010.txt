ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OUR COMPANY
Sylvamo Corporation (the “Company” or “Sylvamo”, which may also be referred to as “we” or “us”) is a global uncoated papers company with a broad portfolio of top-tier brands and low-cost, large-scale paper mills located in and serving the most attractive geographies, including Europe, Latin America and North America. We produce uncoated freesheet (“UFS”) for paper products such as cutsize and offset paper, as well as market pulp, aseptic and liquid packaging board (“LPB”) and coated unbleached kraft (“CUK”) papers. With roots going back to 1898, we have a long history of offering premium quality papers to meet the needs of our customers and end-users. Our mills predominantly rank in the lowest quartile on global and regional UFS cost curves, and we believe our low-cost operations enable us to serve our customers with the highest quality products at attractive margins. Our industry-leading brands, known for their long-standing reputation in their respective markets for product quality and performance, allow us to maintain our long-term relationships with top-tier customers throughout economic cycles. Our international reach and strong positioning across retail, merchant and e-commerce channels optimally positions us to meet the paper needs of our end-users around the world. This also provides geographical diversification of our revenue and profits. From 2019 to 2021, on average, we generated 51% of our revenues and 68% of our Business Segment Operating Profit in Europe and Latin America, which exhibit different supply and demand characteristics than North America, and all three regions have strong profitability for the uncoated paper industry relative to other geographies. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Description of Business Segments - Results of Operations for a definition of Business Segment Operating Profit.

2021 Revenues by Product Type
UFS, our primary product, has diverse end-use applications, including printing, copy and writing papers, and advertising and promotional materials such as brochures, pamphlets, greeting cards, books, annual reports and direct mail. Additionally, we produce a wide variety of uncoated paper grades that our customers convert into envelopes, writing tablets, business forms, packaging and file folders. As a vertically integrated operator, we produce hardwood pulp (including bleached hardwood kraft 
(“BHK”) and bleached eucalyptus kraft (“BEK”), and we produce bleached softwood kraft (“BSK”). We also produce bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp (“BCTMP”) at our Svetogorsk, Russia mill, which we sell globally. Further, our Svetogorsk mill produces LPB and CUK papers that are sold across Russia and Eastern European countries.
Many of our UFS products, particularly cutsize, are branded with strong consumer recognition and top brand positioning in their respective markets. We believe our portfolio of trusted brands across our regions provides us with a meaningful competitive advantage. We own some of the industry’s most recognizable brands, including Chamex (Brazil), REY (France), SvetoCopy (Russia) and Hammermill (United States). Cutsize represents approximately 60% of our UFS tons sold, and our owned and licensed brands represent 58% of those cutsize sales. Further, we have a license from HP Inc. (“HP”) for the rights to produce and sell HP branded printer and copier paper in almost all geographies globally. HP Papers is a premium line of uncoated cutsize products that work seamlessly across all models of printer and copier equipment. The remaining 42% of cutsize tons sold are private label brands we produce for our major customers, including Staples.
We sell and market our products globally to over 700 customers. By leveraging our strong brand portfolio and our customized service, we have built deep relationships with top customers in each of the channels we serve. We distribute our products through a variety of channels, including merchants and distributors, office product suppliers, retailers and dealers. We also sell directly to converters that produce envelopes, forms and other similar products. With a long history of more than 120 years, we have forged long-term relationships with our top customers and their loyalty results in very little turnover. Accordingly, our top ten customers, representing approximately one-third of our net sales, have been buying our products for more than 50 years on average. Our sales, marketing, supply chain and production staff work collaboratively to provide tailored client support, addressing the distinct needs of customers across geographies and channels. We provide marketing support to our customers to help them develop their go-to-market strategies by leveraging our extensive end-user sales and preference data.
Our mills have an annual UFS paper production capacity of 2.8 million short tons, market pulp production capacity of 580,000 short tons, and total LPB and CUK capacity of 130,000 short tons. In addition, Sylvamo expects to distribute annually an incremental 495,000 short tons of UFS and 160,000 short tons of uncoated bristols through its offtake agreements with International Paper in North America. Sylvamo is a party to the Joint Marketing Agreement with JSC Ilim Group in Russia, which allows us to retain the exclusive rights to market and sell all of the JSC Ilim Group’s UFS production, which totals 230,000 short tons annually. Our mill portfolio includes seven low-cost mills, six of which are fully vertically integrated. Vertical integration reduces costs associated with key inputs for paper production, such as pulp and energy, and decreases our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Our only non-vertically integrated mill is co-located with Suzano’s market pulp mill and has a market supply agreement with Suzano, ensuring a consistent supply of fiber, steam and energy contractually guaranteed on a long-term basis. This effectively replicates most of the key economic benefits of vertical integration without the associated capital costs. We have high quality, well-invested facilities with low operating costs. As of September 30, 2021, more than 70% of our capacity is in the lowest quartile of global and regional cost curves. We believe the competitive advantages of our mills, such as their location in sustainable low-cost fiber baskets, and significant scale and distribution efficiencies, afford us sustainable strategic benefits.
The demand for our paper products is positively correlated with global commercial printing and print advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and government spending, including education spending, and negatively affected by the adoption of electronic billing and statements. We believe our low-cost position allows us to thrive in all demand environments, including in countries facing secular demand decline, and we have demonstrated this historically by strengthening Sylvamo’s supply position even in light of the rise of electronic media substitution. From 2015 through 2021, we outperformed the UFS industry demand by 1.8% on average in the regions we serve, and, in the future, we intend to target outperforming the UFS industry demand by 1% to 2% on average in such regions. We expect global demand for UFS to be flat from 2022 to 2026, based on RISI forecasts from September 2021. Approximately two-thirds of Business Segment Operating Profit on average from 2019 to 2021 comes from outside North America, and some of our key geographies, such as Latin America, have an increasing population of white-collar professionals, which supports the demand for our products.
We provide differentiated products and services in each geography we serve, underpinned by our low-cost facilities, premium brands and a talented workforce.
•Europe: Our European business primarily produces and sells cutsize, commercial printing and specialty papers, in addition to LPB, CUK, BCTMP (Russia), BHK and BSK (France). We own two mills in the region with a total annual production capacity of 1.1 million short tons: Svetogorsk in Russia near the Finnish border and Saillat in France. Both mills produce pulp and paper and are fully vertically integrated. Our paper and pulp mill in Svetogorsk covers approximately 494 acres on the Karelian Isthmus between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga in northwestern Russia, and comprises three pulp mills and two paper machines with an annual production capacity of 720,000 short tons. The mill produces cutsize and 
offset paper and is the only producer of LPB in Russia with a supply position greater than 50% based on Russian customs data. Svetogorsk produces BCTMP, which is manufactured from aspen or spruce with innovative technology and allows Sylvamo to maintain an advantaged cost position relative to most other European and Russian mills making similar products. We are able to capture demand in both UFS and BCTMP in other countries throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia out of our Svetogorsk mill. Sylvamo is a party to the Joint Marketing Agreement with JSC Ilim Group, which allows us to retain the exclusive rights to market and sell all of JSC Ilim Group’s UFS production totaling 230,000 short tons annually. The JSC Ilim Group is the largest pulp and paper company in Russia and operates the largest pulp and paper mills located in the European and Siberian regions of Russia, with a total pulp and paper production capacity of 4 million short tons annually. It is controlled by Ilim SA, a 50/50 joint venture between International Paper and its partners. Our paper and pulp mill in Saillat is a European leader in the production of premium grade paper with an annual production capacity of 265,000 short tons and opportunities to grow sales outside of Europe. The mill also produces an additional 130,000 short tons annually of BHK and BSK market pulp that is sold to customers in Western Europe. In Russia, we have long-term harvesting rights on 860,000 acres of government-owned forestland, where we also plant seedlings to maintain the health and productivity of forest ecosystems for future generations.
We own a portfolio of premium brands in Europe. Our REY brand is distributed primarily in France and is focused on sustainability. Our brands in Russia include Ballet and SvetoCopy, which was the first office paper brand to be produced in Russia, and together are the leading brands in the country with an estimated 45% supply position, including JSC Ilim Group’s expected cutsize capacity under the Joint Marketing Agreement based on internal estimates.
•Latin America: Our Latin American business is engaged in the production and sale of cutsize, commercial printing and specialty papers, as well as converting papers and market pulp. We are the largest UFS producer in Latin America, with about 34% of the supply position as of September 2021 according to Fisher International. We sell approximately 78% of our Brazilian UFS production in 26 countries in Latin America, and export the balance to other regions around the globe. Our system of paper production consists of three mills in Brazil: two in the state of São Paulo and one in Mato Grosso do Sul. Together, our three mills have seven paper machines with an annual production capacity of 1.3 million short tons. Our integrated mill in Luiz Antônio is the lowest cost mill in Sylvamo’s portfolio, as measured by roll manufacturing cost per ton, and produces cutsize and offset UFS and market pulp. The mill has an annual production capacity of 385,000 short tons of UFS on two paper machines and also produces an additional 130,000 short tons of market pulp annually. Our mill in Mogi Guaçu is also fully integrated, and operates four paper machines that produce 460,000 short tons of UFS, primarily cutsize and offset paper. Três Lagoas, located in Mato Grosso do Sul, operates one paper machine and produces 260,000 short tons of UFS annually.
We also own approximately 250,000 acres of strategic forest plantations in close proximity to our two mills in São Paulo state. This land provides us with a sustainable source of high quality and low-cost hardwood fiber from eucalyptus. Eucalyptus and its fiber have several benefits, including:
•Fastest growing and highest yielding species grown in timber plantations;
•Shortened harvest cycles of 6 to 7 years, helping to keep plantation costs low; and
•Homogenous fiber quality, which permits premium grade quality at lower costs by requiring less wood to manufacture our products.
Our portfolio of brands includes two lines of printing and writing paper, Chamex and Chamequinho, and one graphic paper line, Chambril, all 100% produced from sustainably managed forests, holding Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (“PEFC”) certification and existing Forest Stewardship Council™ (“FSC®”) certification. We believe our Chamex brand has enjoyed unparalleled brand recognition in Brazil for the last 50 years.
•North America: Our North American business is engaged primarily in the production and sale of cutsize, commercial printing, converting and specialty papers. We are the second largest UFS producer in North America with a 28% supply position as of September 2021, according to Fisher International, including UFS we purchase from International Paper’s Riverdale, Alabama and Georgetown, South Carolina mills pursuant to offtake agreements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors “- We rely on certain commercial agreements with International Paper whereby a substantial amount of our production in the United States is outsourced, the loss of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation” for further information regarding the terms of the offtake agreements. We own two of the industry’s most competitive mills in Eastover, South Carolina and Ticonderoga, New York with 1.1 million short tons of combined annual production capacity. The Eastover mill operates two paper machines producing 700,000 short tons of UFS, and a chemical 
pulping system producing fiber for UFS and an additional 115,000 short tons of market pulp annually. Eastover’s highly advantaged cost position in North America stems from its strategic location in an attractive fiber basket and world-class production capabilities. Sylvamo also operates a premium-grade paper mill in Ticonderoga with a well-invested asset base and proven capabilities to service the North American specialty segment. Its two paper machines and chemical pulp system produces 275,000 short tons of UFS annually, focusing on specialty paper grades. Our offtake agreements with International Paper give us the right to market and sell the UFS paper and uncoated bristols production at the Riverdale and Georgetown mills, representing an incremental 655,000 short tons of annual production capacity. Our North American mills are positioned near sustainably-managed forests that provide long-term access to competitively priced fiber.
In North America, we own a portfolio of premium brands, including Hammermill, Springhill, Williamsburg, Postmark and Accent. According to a third-party market study conducted by TRC Advisory in 2019, the quality and product breadth associated with the Hammermill brand resulted in strong end-user customer willingness to pay. Its unparalleled brand recognition helped us secure our strategic partnership with the largest e-commerce supplier in North America.
  2021 Revenues by Segment  2021 Operating Profit by Segment
 

Sylvamo recognizes that a sustainably managed forest is one that maintains and enhances economic, social, and environmental values for the benefit of present and future generations. We are deeply committed to long-term environmental sustainability by ensuring sustainable sourcing of fiber and investing in and utilizing renewable energy resources. The majority of our mills are located in attractive and sustainable fiber baskets that provide access to high quality, low-cost fiber. Our practice of sourcing fiber from well-managed forests promotes the long-term health and productivity of forests. A majority of our fiber supply in the United States and France comes from privately owned forests. We work with landowners and wood suppliers to advance credible third-party forest certifications to improve our percentage of certified fiber. We follow a Fiber Certification Policy that accepts globally recognized forest management standards. These include the PEFC and standards recognized by PEFC, including the American Tree Farm System® (“ATFS®”) and Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (“SFI®”) in the United States and the Brazilian National Forest Certification Program, Certificacão Florestal (“CERFLOR”) in Brazil. 
We own 250,000 acres of strategic forest plantations in close proximity to our mills in Brazil, which provides a sustainable source of high quality hardwood fiber from fast-growth eucalyptus. We reserve 75,000 acres towards our conservation efforts, through which we plant native tree species to help preserve biodiversity. In Russia, we have long-term harvesting rights on 860,000 acres of government-owned forestland, where we also plant seedlings to maintain the health and productivity of forest ecosystems for future generations. Sylvamo’s forestlands in Brazil and Russia are a significant source of value for our business and are strategic assets in profitable geographies. All the forestland we own in Brazil is certified under CERFLOR and FSC® certification. Our forestland for which we have harvesting rights in Russia also has the FSC® certification.
All of our integrated mills use renewable biomass residuals to create energy and decrease our dependence on third-party energy sources. On average, we produce 78% of our energy needs for our integrated mills through bio-energy, which is a carbon neutral energy source generated from renewable biomass residuals. We also believe in the responsible consumption of our products, and invest in recyclable, sustainable and renewable products. We have invested in product lines, such as the Hammermill Great White products, which are made from recycled materials. All of our products are recyclable, and we encourage our customers to utilize recycling services and custom recycling programs that support their business needs. In 2019, 
approximately 66% of all paper products in the United States were recycled to make new fiber-based products, according to the most recent data from the American Forest and Paper Association.
Sylvamo’s capabilities and potential are delivered through our dedicated and talented workforce, which we believe is the best in the industry. We employ more than 7,500 people globally, with 35%, 43% and 22% of our workforce located primarily in 14 countries in Europe, Latin America and North America, respectively. We have a favorable employee engagement score of 86%, compared to the manufacturing industry average of 75%, according to a 2019 third-party employee engagement survey. The above-average employee engagement score at Sylvamo is driven by our employees’ perception of their career goals, employee safety, diversity in the workforce, understanding of the company’s goals, work life balance and other indicators. Specifically, employees rated safety at Sylvamo with a 91% favorability rate.
The health and safety of our employees is paramount. We strive to design and operate injury-free workplaces for our employees and everyone who enters our facilities. As responsible stewards of people and their communities, we have maintained record safety standards, strictly complying with national regulations such as, in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s regulations. We are an industry-leading company in employee safety. Across our mills, our Total Incident Rate (“TIR”) averaged 0.41 and our Lost Work Incident Rate (“LWIR”) averaged 0.09 for 2021, well below the 2020 U.S. paper manufacturing industry averages of 2.4 and 0.9, respectively, according to the most recent information available from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Our Competitive Strengths
We distinguish ourselves through the following competitive strengths:
A global producer of uncoated freesheet, positioned in the most profitable geographies: Europe, Latin America and North America.
We believe our mills, and consequently the key regions that we serve, are located in some of the world’s most attractive geographies for UFS. Given the access to low cost fiber and historical pricing levels, the regions we serve are some of the most profitable over the past three years based on average import pricing data from IHS Markit.
We rank third in supply position in Europe, including our mill in Russia and JSC Ilim Group’s expected cutsize capacity under the Joint Marketing Agreement as of September 2021, according to Fisher International. We have consistently outperformed relative to industry demand in Europe. Due to the one-time impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in such year, we have excluded 2020 market data from the discussion below. From 2011 to 2019, while the overall UFS demand in Europe fell by 2%, the demand for our products remained stable. Demand for UFS in Western Europe declined at a 2.8% CAGR from 2014 to 2019 and we expect demand for UFS in Western Europe to continue to decrease by a 2.4% CAGR from 2021 to 2026, based on RISI data and forecasts. In Eastern Europe, demand for UFS declined at a 0.7% CAGR from 2014 to 2019, and we expect demand in Eastern Europe to increase by a 0.5% CAGR from 2021 to 2026, based on RISI data and forecasts. Industry capacity in Eastern Europe increased at a 0.7% CAGR from 2014 to 2019, while Western Europe decreased at a 2.4% CAGR over the same time period, according to RISI data and forecasts. We expect that industry capacity will decline by a 2.2% CAGR and a 3.7% CAGR in Eastern Europe and Western Europe, respectively, from 2021 to 2026, based on RISI data and forecasts. We have a niche positioning in Europe, with our Saillat mill focusing its production on specialty UFS. In Russia, we have the number one supply position and the leading brand, SvetoCopy. We also have a strong position in other growing markets, such as the Commonwealth of Independent States, comprised of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. Sylvamo is a party to the Joint Marketing Agreement with JSC Ilim Group, which allows us to retain the exclusive rights to market and sell all of JSC Ilim Group’s UFS production totaling 230,000 short tons annually.
In Latin America, we are a major producer of UFS with a 34% supply position as of September 2021, according to Fisher International. Latin America is a particularly attractive region given its rising levels of education, growth in white-collar employment and increasing income per capita, all of which drive UFS demand. Due to the one-time impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in such year, we have excluded 2020 market data from the discussion below. From 2014 to 2019, UFS demand in Latin America decreased at a 3.1% CAGR due to the recession in Brazil during that period, and we expect it to increase at a CAGR of 0.6% from 2021 to 2026, based on RISI data and forecasts. Industry capacity in Latin America declined at a 0.3% CAGR from 2014 to 2019, and we expect it to continue to decline at a 1.1% CAGR from 2021 to 2026, based on RISI data and forecasts. Moreover, the key raw material input we use in our Brazil mills is eucalyptus, which is a world-class, low-cost fiber for the production of UFS. The use of low-cost fiber combined with our highly efficient operations, as measured by our Overall Machine Efficiency metrics of approximately 90% in Latin America, and export logistics advantage allow us to serve the domestic market and the export markets at attractive margins.
In North America, we are the second largest producer of UFS with a 28% supply position as of September 2021, according to Fisher International, including UFS we purchase from International Paper’s Riverdale and Georgetown mills pursuant to offtake agreements. We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from improving fundamentals in the paper industry, which are inherently linked to the balance of supply and demand. In North America, a number of competitors have announced conversion of paper mills to primarily containerboard and fluff pulp capacity, leading to favorable operating rates. North American producers have announced the shutdown of approximately 1.5 million short tons of UFS capacity, or approximately 24% of the industry capacity, since 2019, according to RISI. As a result of these actions, North American UFS operating rates increased significantly from low operating rates in 2020 after a mid-2021 industry recovery according to RISI. We believe that higher operating rates will enable us to continue to benefit from improving supply and demand dynamics through our superior cost position. Due to the one-time impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in such year, we have excluded 2020 market data from the discussion below. Demand for UFS in North America fell at a 3.5% CAGR from 2014 to 2019 and we expect it to continue to fall at a 2.8% CAGR from 2021 to 2026, based on RISI data and forecasts. Industry capacity in North America decreased at a 3.1% CAGR from 2014 to 2019, and we expect it to continue to decrease at a 1.9% CAGR from 2021 to 2026, based on RISI data and forecasts.

Vertically integrated mills that are predominantly in the lowest quartile on the cost curve both in their regions and globally.
Our attractive, low cost positions are particularly important given that we have exposure to geographies that are either in secular decline or are experiencing limited to no growth. Historically we have seen that as volumes decline, competitors close higher cost mills or convert mills to other uses. We expect this trend to continue and therefore, we expect to be able to improve 
operating rates for our assets. As a result, we expect to be able to generate improved margins and substantial cash flow over the long-term despite stable or declining demand in our industry.
Our low production costs are driven by the scale of our production capacity, our mills’ proximity to fiber, self-produced energy, and the integration of our pulp and paper production process. In particular, our vertical integration into pulp helps minimize our exposure to commodity pulp price fluctuations. 
Our European mills produce their own pulp that is directly used for the production of paper. Our Saillat mill is the largest fully integrated UFS mill in France and the only vertically integrated mill producing value-added grades in Europe that covers the entire production process from wood harvesting to paper. Its modern pulp mill produces pulp for 100% of its UFS production as well as an additional 130,000 short tons of market pulp that is sold in France and Western Europe. In Russia, our Svetogorsk mill is fully integrated with three pulp mills and two paper machines. We also have long-term harvesting rights on 860,000 acres of forestland in Russia for excellent access to wood fiber. 
In Brazil, we own eucalyptus plantations in close proximity to our two São Paulo state mills, giving us access to high-quality, low-cost eucalyptus fiber. These two mills produce their own pulp that is directly used for paper production. Our third Brazilian mill, Três Lagoas, is co-located with Suzano’s market pulp mill and has a market supply agreement with Suzano, ensuring a consistent supply of fiber, steam and energy contractually guaranteed on a long-term basis. Consequently, Três Lagoas has all the benefits of integration without the associated capital costs, and therefore generates a high cash yield per ton of capacity. In fact, after accounting for the Brazilian government tax benefit (88% VAT reduction for Três Lagoas production sold domestically) and the benefits of integration and co-location with Suzano’s market pulp mill, we estimate that Três Lagoas would have production costs comparable to Mogi Guaçu, which is in the first quartile of the cost curve. Furthermore, our own produced market pulp sales from the integrated mills in Brazil work as a natural hedge for the Três Lagoas purchased pulp contract. Accordingly, from 2019 to 2021, Três Lagoas’ return on invested capital was on average approximately 770 basis points higher than Mogi Guaçu’s return on invested capital.
All of our North American mills produce their own pulp. The Eastover mill enjoys the lowest manufacturing cost in North America according to Fisher International, and operates one of the highest-quality cutsize paper machines in North America. The mill generates its own electricity to run its two paper machines and one pulp dryer. It produces sufficient pulp to meet its needs for paper production and an additional 115,000 short tons of market pulp sold in the open market each year. Ticonderoga is a premium-grade, vertically integrated paper mill with a competitive low-cost positioning against other specialty mills, according to Fisher International. Overall, our mills have an average pulp integration of approximately 95%, requiring that we buy only 5% of our pulp inputs in the open market.
Our integrated Brazilian, Russian and U.S. Eastover mills have historically occupied first quartile positions in the global cost curve, and our Saillat and U.S. Ticonderoga mills have historically occupied first quartile positions on the regional specialty cost curves. We believe our low-cost operations enable us to serve our local customers with the highest quality products at competitive margins. Our Russian and Brazilian paper operations have provided strong and steady margins for more than 10 years. Most importantly, these global low-cost operations help us to remain competitive in the export markets. Our ability to participate in the export markets allows us to meet demand in other regions with a steady and reliant supply of paper, allowing us to maintain consistent operating rates in almost all demand environments.

Premier brands in Europe, Latin America and North America with strong brand recognition.
Our portfolio of iconic, regional brands is widely recognized for its quality and reliability. We own premier brands across the globe, including Chamex, Chamequinho, Chambril, SvetoCopy, REY, Pro-Design, Ballet, Hammermill, Springhill, Williamsburg, Postmark and Accent. These brands have a long-standing reputation in their respective markets for product quality and performance. Our strong brands have allowed us to outperform industry volumes and have supported the business through economic cycles by providing improved profitability. Over the last six years, we have outperformed the industry in terms of UFS shipments by 180 basis points annually in the geographies in which we operate. Through the downturn caused by 
the COVID-19 pandemic, our brands demonstrated higher brand loyalty relative to private label offerings, as evidenced by a lower decrease in our owned brand sales in 2020 and 2021 as compared to the overall industry. In addition, in 2020 and 2021, we outperformed the industry UFS shipments in the geographies in which we operate by 340 basis points.
We believe our Chamex brand enjoys unparalleled brand recognition in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America. Chamex has been part of the Brazilian culture for more than 50 years. Entire generations have grown up using Chamex in school and in the workplace. To leverage this recognition, we introduced the Chamequinho brand to target younger populations and keep the Chamex loyalty for generations to come. Chamex is the leading brand in terms of supply position in Bolivia, Brazil, Central America and Paraguay, with a 29% supply position in Latin America, according to third-party global trade data.
Our SvetoCopy brand is the leading brand in Russia in terms of supply position and brand loyalty, according to market research and consulting firm IPSOS. SvetoCopy was the first office paper brand to be produced in Russia beginning in 1996, prior to which all office paper in Russia was imported. During our more than 20 years in Russia, we have delivered on SvetoCopy’s quality and brand reputation and have become a reliable partner for businesses.
In France, our REY brand offers a very broad range of innovative products, including commodity and value-added grades that promote sustainability. The REY brand continues to grow its recognition in France and is gaining popularity across Western Europe. Positioned as the conscientious paper choice, REY wants to represent sustainability in the office paper segment, with products ranging from white papers to tints (colors). Pro-Design is our flagship brand for professional high speed printing in Europe. Over the past decade, Pro-Design has established itself as a top-shelf product for full color, high quality laser print applications. All brands made at our Saillat mill are certified by either FSC® or PEFC and the EU Ecolabel. 
The Hammermill brand has a deep heritage in the United States with over 120 years of existence, and we believe it is a leading copy paper brand in the United States. We continue to invest to make the brand relevant throughout generations, and have adapted our products to the digital age. In 2003, we introduced our JAM-FREE® technology, which guarantees less than one jam in 10,000 printed sheets on high-speed digital equipment. The Hammermill Great White product was developed within the cutsize paper product line and is made from recycled materials. We recently developed and launched our Sylvamo Shop, which provides our customers with 24/7 access to place orders, check inventory, and monitor order status from their computer, tablet or smart phone. Our Sylvamo Shop makes doing business with us more efficient and simpler for our customers, helping us capture a greater share of their business.
In 1996, we launched the HP Papers office paper products under license from HP Inc., allowing us to exclusively manufacture and market HP Papers in over 75 countries. HP Papers is a global paper brand and is manufactured in all our regions. It is a premium line of uncoated cutsize products, scientifically engineered to work seamlessly across all makes and models of printer and copier equipment. HP Papers, HP inks and toners and HP printers are engineered to work together. In the early 2000s, we again partnered with HP to develop and introduce ColorLok Technology to improve inkjet printing quality in offices and homes around the world. Taking advantage of developments in high-speed inkjet technology, our ColorLok Technology optimization gives excellent results with both laser and high-speed inkjet sheet-fed printers.
Our brands represent 58% of our cutsize sales, and private labels represent the remaining 42%. Our private label strategy focuses primarily on North America, where we produce paper for companies such as Staples. Our top three private label customers represent approximately 300,000 short tons annually of private label sales.
Long-term, committed relationships with key customers and partners in the UFS value chain and a growing position in e-commerce.
We serve over 700 customers across every region of the world through diverse sales channels, including office product suppliers, retailers, e-commerce, converters, dealers and merchants. Our global scale and local focus help us stay committed to key customers and partners across the UFS supply chain. Over the years, we have built long-term relationships with customers thanks to our commitment to their business. We are aligned with the premier participants in all the main channels in Europe, Latin America and North America.
Our sales teams are coordinated to efficiently bring a competitive and complete product offering to our diverse customer base. We bring together our sales, marketing, supply chain and production staff to provide service and support to merchants, converters, end-users, stationers, printers and retailers alike. We further support our customers with our breadth of end-user applications, such as printing paper, brochures, pamphlets, greeting cards, books, packaging and envelopes. This mitigates our exposure to any one channel or end-use and creates value for our customers, and we excel at managing the complexity this adds to our operations. As a result, we have fostered long-term relationships with our customers with minimal customer turnover. On 
average, our top 10 customers have been our business partners for 50 years, and today they represent approximately 35% of our supply position, with no one customer making up more than 10% of our supply position.
Leading customers with long-standing relationships per region
We have the ability to adapt as our end-users change their channel preferences. We are well positioned to compete in the e-commerce channel, which relies more heavily on high-grade brands than traditional retail channels. We have been able to rapidly grow our e-commerce presence through close partnerships with online retailers such as Amazon in North America and Kalunga in Brazil. We have increased our sales through Amazon in North America by more than six times over the past six years. Overall, we have increased our North America e-commerce sales by approximately 90% over the past six years. Today, e-commerce makes up approximately 10% of North American sales, and we believe Sylvamo sales represent greater than 50% of the channel overall in 2020, according to internal marketing intelligence. We are seeing similar trends in e-commerce developing in Europe and Latin America.
Well-invested facilities running highly efficient operations.
We believe our mills are well-invested, and we have made significant capital investments over time. Our capital spending includes maintenance, regulatory and reforestation capital expenditures, cost reduction capital expenditures, and strategic capital expenditures, which include capital for rebuilds, productivity enhancements and de-bottlenecking. We believe that the investments in our well-maintained and efficient facilities increase equipment uptime and improve reliability. The only major capital expenditure across our portfolio of mills anticipated in the next few years is replacing the two recovery boilers at our Svetogorsk mill with one new recovery boiler. Our Board of Directors has approved pre-engineering work on this boiler replacement in 2022. Our mills are technically advanced, and Sylvamo operates the two most recently built UFS assets in Latin America – Luís Antônio and Três Lagoas in Brazil. Our Svetogorsk mill is one of the top pulp and paper mills in Russia with industry-leading technology and equipment. Since 1998, approximately $780 million has been invested in the upgrade and modernization of the mill to ensure its long-term competitiveness. For example, our former parent, International Paper, constructed the BCTMP plant in 2008, which provides higher yields than other processes and lowers the total cost of production. IP also installed a coater at one of the paper machines, allowing us to produce CUK and LPB to meet market demand. Our Eastover mill is one of the most technologically advanced pulp and paper mills in the world and, as a result, it is the lowest cost producer of UFS in North America according to Fisher International. It has a history of continued investment, with over $160 million in capital deployed since 2015. Our Ticonderoga mill is a premium-grade, vertically integrated pulp and paper mill, with a well-invested asset base and proven capabilities to service the North American specialty segment. Over $100 million of capital spending has been deployed to the Ticonderoga mill since 2015.
Strong and stable earnings and cash flow generation.
We have a track record of generating strong earnings and significant cash flow across cycles due to our low-cost asset base, disciplined capital investment, customer and geographic diversification, operational flexibility and strong brand recognition. We have been able to generate strong Adjusted EBITDA Margins as uncoated freesheet demand continues to improve in all three of our regions as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. For the years ended 2019, 2020 and 2021, our Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 17.6%, 12.4% and 17.0%, respectively. Free Cash Flow, calculated as Cash Provided by Operating Activities minus maintenance, regulatory and reforestation capital expenditures, was $406 million, $284 million and $473 million for 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. See Item. 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA margins and Free Cash Flow. 
Our ability to reduce capital spending in times of economic downturns allow us to continue generating strong cash flow while maintaining appropriate levels of spending for safety and regulatory issues. For example, we reduced our total capital expenditures in 2020 to $75 million from $150 million in 2018 by delaying capital expenditures. Accordingly, we anticipate increasing capital spending to ensure that our mills stay well-invested and well maintained. This increase may negatively impact free cash flow, but we anticipate Adjusted EBITDA Margins to stay above 15%. 

($’s in millions)


Our portfolio of low-cost mills enables us to achieve healthy margins. Our vertically integrated mills help minimize our exposure to the volatility of raw material prices and generate a consistent stream of cash flows. Further, we have positioned ourselves in the most attractive local markets, where we leverage our low manufacturing costs to maximize earnings. Our management’s experience in managing costs and leveraging lean processes fosters a culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement.
Our geographic, product and channel diversity gives us the flexibility to adjust to end-market demand fluctuations and maintain margins. Specifically, our global platform allows us to offset the effects of volatile movements of major currencies by tactically positioning ourselves in the export and import market to our advantage. Our broad product categories allow us to meet end-user demand for a wide variety of paper products. Additionally, our channel diversity helps us better adapt to our end-users’ channel preference with a wide breadth of end-user applications. This customer-focused strategy coupled with our decades of investments in our strong brands has allowed us to weather down-cycles.

Together, Jean-Michel and John lead an experienced and highly capable senior management team at Sylvamo.
Strategic Overview
Our commitment to responsible environmental, social and governance principles is embedded throughout our three-pronged strategy, which focuses on creating value for our stockholders through:
1.Commercial Excellence: Remain the supplier of choice by exceeding customers’ expectations for quality and service.
2.Operational Excellence: Operate as a low-cost, focused, cash-generating company.
3.Financial Discipline: Be the investment of choice by consistently delivering on a compelling investment thesis.
Specific initiatives we are focused on include:
Be commercially excellent to drive top-line growth and profitability.
•Our diversified product offering and leading supply position allow us to better serve our customers. Sylvamo’s product portfolio covers a broad range of products that our customers use and sell for a wide breadth of end-user applications. This diversified offering of paper products not only creates value for our customers, but also mitigates our exposure to any one channel or end-use. Furthermore, our advantaged supply position gives us the significant global scale to serve customers close to their operations while leveraging distribution efficiencies to benefit our customers.
•Our global portfolio of premium-margin branded and private label offerings differentiates our products in local markets. We intend to focus on maintaining and improving the success of our existing brands to further drive profitable growth. We have become the partner of choice for many businesses and households around the world, and we plan to continue to deliver on our brands’ reputations for quality. We believe that we can drive top-line growth and profitability by further enhancing our brand positioning across geographies, growing our loyal customer base and tapping into growing pockets of demand in select channels and geographies. For example, in 2019 we expanded SvetoCopy’s brand range to include a new product, SvetoCopy Premium, to better serve the premium market. We also utilize our marketing expertise and promotional support to help our customers market and sell our products more effectively. For example, in Brazil, we have a dedicated team of more than 20 promoters spread across the country visiting stores and developing campaigns to increase Chamex sales through promotional activity.
•We will continue to invest in and focus on our strong, long-term customer relationships around the globe. We will support our customers through the quality and reliability of our products, customer service and our customer-centric innovation. We believe research and development (“R&D”) and innovation are core competencies of Sylvamo, and plan to leverage these capabilities to further strengthen our market positioning. We already supply to most of the top participants across all major channels, and we see potential to further expand our supply position. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic we helped our customers navigate stay-at-home orders by quickly introducing new packaging sizes that allowed for safe home delivery of UFS products. In Latin America, we created a group of preferred corporate distributors aimed at improving the go-to-market strategies for our top customers. In Europe, we are launching a plastic free wrapper used as packaging for our brands, as our end-users increasingly demand sustainable products. Our service and sales teams are trained to enhance our positioning with key customers. We believe developing customer loyalty through market-based value creation will help us differentiate our offerings and position us for steady cash generation from our core customer base as well as allow us to expand our customer base and defend our advantaged supply position.
•We adapt and innovate as our end-customers change their channel preferences. We have successfully entered the e-commerce channel by innovating around pallet and box sizes to better service the needs of our e-retailer customers. In Europe, Sylvamo is one of the largest cutsize suppliers to the e-commerce channel, providing owned and licensed brands, as well as private brands. In Latin America, we introduced an innovative package with fewer sheets per ream and a lower basis weight with fewer reams per box, which facilitates last mile delivery via motorcycle, a common 
transportation method in the region. Our brands represent greater than 50% of sales in the e-commerce channel in North America. By further aligning ourselves with key e-commerce customers, we believe we will continue to lead the industry in performance. We believe we can increase customer penetration and drive top-line growth as we upgrade our warehousing systems, leverage new packaging techniques and increase our utilization of e-commerce channels.
Operational excellence and low-cost operations to drive stockholder value.
•We have a history of profitability and offsetting inflation through our low-cost operations. We averaged Adjusted EBITDA margins (defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales) of 15.7% from 2019 to 2021, and we intend to target Adjusted EBITDA margins of between 15% and 18% over the business cycle. We have successfully implemented price increases and maintained a strategy of finding ways to offset input cost inflation. Our low-cost assets allow us the operational flexibility to produce a diverse product mix and serve multiple attractive channels, which mitigates our exposure to any one channel or end-use. 
•We have identified future cost reduction initiatives to help us maintain and improve our cost position in local and export markets. We expect to invest in upgrading our facilities not only to maintain our quality and low cost, but also to improve our operational flexibility. We also continuously identify opportunities to further reduce our operating costs, as evidenced by our and our former parent company’s track record of investing over $25 million on cost reduction projects per annum on average from 2011 to 2021, helping us maintain our competitive margins. We produce diverse product lines that maximize margin and value creation. For example, Eastover is able to efficiently produce different UFS product lines on its two paper machines. Additionally, when UFS demand is high we can divert more pulp to the paper machines from the market pulp machine to increase UFS production and similarly, when UFS demand is soft, we can divert more pulp to the market pulp machine. We have a similar flexible operating model across all of our geographies. Investments in technologies such as data analytics in mills to reduce costs, enhance flexibility and improve decision-making are key initiatives for Sylvamo. We expect these investments to be modest, and provide the company meaningful commercial, operational and financial benefits.
•We utilize lean six sigma and other management tools to drive further cost reductions and operating improvements in our manufacturing system. Our manufacturing system focuses on six key areas, including environmental, health and safety and efficiency improvement. We track our operations against Overall Equipment Effectiveness and other key metrics to drive increasingly lean operations and ensure full visibility across our operations. Recently, we have used data analytics at our mills to further accelerate the improvement progress. Going forward we expect disruptive technology to become a significant lever for future improvement. We plan to continue utilizing our lean tools and principles and implement targeted programs in order to optimize raw materials sourcing and usage, eliminate process waste, reduce repair costs and control overhead, driving cost reductions and operating improvements across our manufacturing system.
Pursue a disciplined approach to capital allocation that rewards stockholders and drives value organically through selective investment to further our advantaged positions.
•We expect to deliver strong and sustainable free cash flow by continuing to leverage our low-cost assets, premier brands, and deep customer relationships with leading companies in each of our sales channels. Our annual maintenance, regulatory and reforestation capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of approximately $130 to $150 million per year for the next several years, which we believe will be sufficient to maintain our operations and productivity. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $18 million on cost reduction capital in 2022. As of the date of this report, the only major capital expenditure anticipated in the next three years is replacing the two recovery boilers at our Svetogorsk mill with one new recovery boiler, which we estimate will cost $220 million over that period. Approximately $15 million is expected to be spent in 2022, with the remainder estimated to be spent in 2023 and 2024. We will pursue a disciplined approach to capital investment to complement the strategic and cost reduction investments made in the last 5 years. Planned future strategic capital expenditures will be pursued where there is the expectation of significant return on invested capital.
•We intend to use a portion of the excess cash flow generated by our business to reduce outstanding indebtedness in a disciplined manner. A healthy balance sheet will support our operations and provide the financial flexibility to maximize value creation for our stockholders. Our near-term priority is debt reduction. In the future, we anticipate that we will target a financial leverage ratio (defined as total indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA) of less than 2.5:1 by the end of 2022. In the future, as we achieve our targeted financial leverage ratio, we anticipate that we will be in a position to return a portion of the cash flow generated by our business to our stockholders through a combination of 
dividends and stock repurchases, depending on market conditions and subject to restrictions under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes (including greater restrictions until the Brazil Tax Dispute is resolved), and approval by our board of directors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors “- Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways, and the cost of compliance with such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of the Brazil Tax Dispute.
•We expect to allocate capital efficiently towards a larger number of projects that have a high return on invested capital. We remain committed to investing in our low-cost, highly competitive asset base, which underpins our operations. We believe in continually optimizing our existing core asset base to drive higher incremental returns above our cost of capital. We plan to focus on further enhancing our operational flexibility by undertaking projects with a high expected return on capital. Sylvamo has preliminarily identified over $100 million of investment projects with potential internal rates of returns (“IRR”) in excess of 25%. We will evaluate investing in these high return projects in the future, while continuing to maintain financial discipline focused on delivering value to our stockholders.
•We will strive to create intrinsic value by achieving returns above our cost of capital. As we move forward, investment excellence is essential to growing earnings and cash generation. Strategic investments will be grounded on clear strategic and financial objectives that allow us to turn Sylvamo’s advantages into profitable growth, with a meaningful return above our cost of capital. We have a strong pipeline of projects that will reduce costs and increase efficiency over the medium- to long-term.
Lastly, we intend to follow a disciplined approach in evaluating any potential strategic transactions. We view our capital allocation framework as a foundational lever to accelerate value creation for our stockholders.
Our commitment to environmental, social and governance matters is embedded throughout our three-pronged strategy.
We incorporate environmental, social and governance considerations into our strategies and everyday processes as we seek to adequately address risks, operate sustainably and responsibly and create long-term value. Our commitment to sustainability includes our entire value chain, from the responsible sourcing of raw materials, to the safety of our employees, to using renewable energy and ensuring the recyclability of our products.
•Environmental stewardship and responsible manufacturing practices are fundamental to how we operate, and we seek supply chain partners that share our commitment. Sylvamo recognizes that a sustainably managed forest is one that maintains and enhances economic, social and environmental values for the benefit of present and future generations. We are committed to producing the products our customers need, while ensuring responsible stewardship of the world’s natural resources. To meet the expectations of our employees, customers and other stakeholders, we will continue to lead forest stewardship efforts globally to build a better future for people, the planet and our company. We work with landowners to advance responsible forest management practices and increase the availability of certified fiber. We also work with conservation organizations to support healthy forest ecosystems, enhance ecologically significant areas, and conserve and restore forests worldwide. Most importantly, our fiber sourcing policies and practices support our commitment to protecting forests and their ecosystems for generations to come.
•We will continue to generate more than 75% of our mill energy needs using renewable biomass residuals rather than fossil fuels. We have made significant investments to promote energy self-sufficiency and replace fossil fuels. For example, in 2012, we completed the construction of a biomass boiler in Mogi Guaçu, Brazil. This high-return cost savings project reduced fossil fuel use by 75% and increased earnings by $30 million in its first year of operation. Saillat, one of the most environmentally efficient mills in the world, is the first French mill to obtain Eco-label certification for copy and graphic papers. PEFC-certified since 2006, Saillat implements rigorous sustainable practices. All of its wood comes from controlled sources, it is 85% energy self-sufficient and it produces 53% fewer carbon emissions from fossil fuels than the average of the European graphic papers sector. Additionally, Saillat and its partner Dalkia, a French energy company, were selected by the French Ministry of Ecological Transition to promote renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emission. Under this program, Saillat and Dalkia will produce 25 mega-watts of biomass energy for a 20-year fixed price thereby reducing Saillat’s energy costs and consumption of fossil fuels.
•We are committed to attracting and developing a diverse talented and global workforce, ensuring safety at our facilities and contributing to the resiliency of our local communities. Our international presence allows us to attract the best talent across the globe. Accordingly, our senior management team is internationally diverse with global 
experience, hailing from all of the geographies in which we operate—Europe, Latin America and North America. Further, we will continue to invest a portion of our earnings to address critical community needs in the communities where our employees live and work. For example, Sylvamo Brazil partners with and supports the AIPI Institute, an educational organization serving the Brazilian community.
We believe that by leveraging our strengths and executing on our strategies, we will create long-term value for our stockholders. Throughout this discussion of our strategic initiatives, we have stated targets and expectations concerning our performance, such as EBITDA margin and financial leverage ratio targets. There is no assurance that we will achieve these targets or expectations. Please see Forward-Looking Statements.
OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Description of Business Segments for further information.
OUR PRODUCTS
Our primary product line is uncoated freesheet papers (“UFS”), which includes cutsize papers, offset papers, and specialty papers. We also produce liquid packaging board, coated unbleached kraft and market pulp.
Uncoated Freesheet Papers
UFS is the largest category of printing and writing papers. It is used in printed communications across products such as copy paper, book publishing, direct mail, envelopes and business form papers. UFS constitutes 80%, or 2.76 million short tons, of the paper, board and market pulp that we have the capability of producing annually.
Cutsize Papers
Cutsize papers are a subset of UFS, and refers to paper that has been trimmed to a specific size for printing, copying and other purposes. Cut-size papers can vary in quality from an everyday 20 lbs. 92 bright product up to a 32 lbs. 100 bright product with superior smoothness and brightness. Examples of cutsize paper include 8.5x11 paper, A3 paper, A4 paper and 11x17 paper for home and office printers.
Our cutsize papers comprise some of the most well-known paper brands in the world, including the following:
Hammermill
Hammermill is Sylvamo’s most-purchased brand of paper for businesses across North America. It is the #1 brand sold through e-commerce channels. The Hammermill brand has a deep heritage in the United States with over 120 years of existence and commands a price premium over private label brands.
HP Papers
We also produce the HP Papers office papers product line, through a partnership for brand use, with HP Inc. HP Papers is manufactured with ColorLok® technology to produce documents with brighter colors, more intense black and quicker drying, with less risk of smudges. It is suitable for home and office use and an ideal brand for high quality printing.
Chamex and Chamequinho
Chamex enjoys strong brand recognition as the leading printing paper in Brazil, being named #1 customer’s choice in Brazil according to internal studies by the Company. Part of Brazilian culture for over 50 years, entire generations have grown up using Chamequinho in school and later Chamex in the workplace. Outside of Brazil, Chamex is exported to more than 60 countries and is recognized for its high quality in Bolivia, Central America, Chile, Peru and Paraguay. For every three sheets of paper consumed in Latin America, one is from Sylvamo’s brands, according to Fisher International. We have leveraged this brand loyalty to introduce additional brands, including Chamequinho, which focuses on younger generations.
REY
Our premium REY brand is sold across Europe with a strong historical presence in France. Sylvamo’s REY brand maintains strong consumer awareness and is recognized as a top leading brand in its market. It is 100% sourced from sustainably managed forests. REY paper sold in Europe has internationally recognized certifications such as FSC®, PEFC and the EU Ecolabel.
SvetoCopy
Before 1996, all office paper in Russia was imported. SvetoCopy was the first office paper brand to be produced in Russia and is now one of two leading brands in the market. SvetoCopy also shows the highest frequency of repeat purchasing alongside the highest level of consumption in Russia according to IPSOS.
Offset Papers
Offset paper is a type of uncoated freesheet paper that is primarily used for printing books, magazines, manuals, catalogs, posters, calendars, flyers, letterheads, publication interior sheets, brochures and envelopes. Offset paper has a relatively coarse surface that enhances its ability to absorb printing inks and dampening solutions making it ideal for offset printing. The surface characteristics of offset paper make it easier to write on with ballpoint and fountain ink pens and to stamp clearly. Uncoated offset papers are commonly used for office stationery for this reason. For printing purposes, it is possible to print high quality, multicolored graphics and illustrations and texts on these papers for a variety of products and publications.
Specialty Papers
Specialty papers are papers with a specialized end use based on the application. These specialty papers products include bleached kraft, release liner and wallboard tape paper. Bleached kraft grades are used for animal feed bags, food packaging or high end shopping bags and are designed to perform through the complete bag making process, from printing and converting, to filling and sealing. Our uncoated release liner products are suitable for polycoating and are designed for good converting performance as well as poly adhesion. These products are used for release papers, label applications and graphic art applications. Wallboard tape paper becomes joint tape that reinforces wall and ceiling joints to prevent cracking. It works on all interior wall and corner joints and is suitable for outside corners and corner bead applications.
Liquid Packaging Board and Coated Unbleached Kraft
LPB and CUK grades are produced at our Svetogorsk mill. Liquid packaging board is primarily used in the beverage packaging industry while coated unbleached kraft is used to package beverages such as beer and soft drinks and for heavy duty packaging needs such as laundry detergent.
Pulp
The Sylvamo pulp business produces softwood, hardwood and bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp (“BCTMP”). These pulp grades are used for our paper products, and the excess is sold globally and used in a variety of products such as tissues and towels, specialty and packaging papers and folding box board. BCTMP provides higher yields than other forms of pulp and is used in coated paperboard grades.
OUR RAW MATERIALS
The manufacturing of paper, board and pulp requires wood fiber, chemicals and energy. We discuss these three key raw materials used in our manufacturing operations below.
Wood Fiber
European paper mills
Our Saillat and Svetogorsk mills are self-sustainable and produce their own bleached pulp for use in paper production. In Saillat, our own wood-sourcing subsidiary provides access to more than 1.1 million tons of wood from private forests annually.
In Russia, in addition to our own harvesting rights to over 860,000 acres of forest land owned by Russia, we source both hardwood and softwood primarily from third party leaseholders. Together, we have reliable access to over 2.0 million cubic meters of wood fiber. Our harvesting rights are valid for terms ranging from 5-30 years. Our harvesting rights may be terminated in the event of certain breaches of contract, including non-payment of rental fees, failure to report on current activities and certain other violations of the agreement.
Latin American paper mills
The fiber used by our two integrated mills at Mogi Guaçu and Luís Antônio come from our owned strategic forestry plantations that cover approximately 250,000 acres, providing a sustainable source of high-quality and low-cost hardwood fiber from eucalyptus. We reserve approximately 75,000 acres of that property to plant native forests to protect the region’s natural biodiversity. Similarly, our non-integrated mill at Três Lagoas uses bleached eucalyptus fiber for paper production. Eucalyptus produces an ideal fiber for making paper, as it is one of the fastest growing and highest yielding species grown on timber plantations with a shortened harvest cycles of six to seven years, which helps to keep the plantation costs low. Its homogenous fiber quality permits premium grade products with better porosity and opacity, which enhances print quality. Eucalyptus also requires less wood to manufacture a ton of pulp, making it an appropriate source for producing pulp and renewable energy, and it requires fewer chemicals during production, reducing the environmental impact of our products.
North American paper mills
The fiber used by our paper mills in the United States is softwood and hardwood, both readily available in the market from multiple third-party sources. These sources include a combination of supply contracts, wood lot management arrangements and advance stumpage and spot market purchases. Both the Ticonderoga and Eastover mills are located near sustainably managed forests in New York and South Carolina, respectively. See Item 1A. Risk Factors “- We rely on certain commercial agreements with International Paper whereby a substantial amount of our production in the United States is outsourced, the loss of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation”  for further information regarding the terms of the offtake agreements.
Chemicals
We use various chemical compounds in our paper, board and pulp manufacturing operations that we purchase through contracts of varying length to ensure product availability. Most of the contracts have pricing that fluctuates based on prevailing market conditions. For paper production, on our machines we also use several chemical products including starch, precipitated calcium carbonate, optical brighteners, dyes and aluminum sulfate. For bleached pulp production, we use numerous chemicals including caustic soda, sodium chlorate, sulfuric acid, lime and peroxide.
Energy
Our operations produce and consume substantial amounts of energy. Our primary energy sources include: biomass residuals, fossil fuels and electricity. Approximately 78% of the total energy required to manufacture our products comes from renewable fuels such as bark and spent pulping liquor, generated as byproducts from our manufacturing processes. The remainder of the energy comes from smaller amounts of fossil fuels such as fuel oil and natural gas and purchased steam procured under supply contracts. Under most of these contracts, suppliers are committed to provide quantities within predetermined ranges that provide us with our needs for a particular type of fuel at a specific facility. Most of these contracts have pricing that may fluctuate based on prevailing market conditions. Biomass residuals and fossil fuels are consumed primarily to produce steam that is used in the manufacturing process and, to a lesser extent, to provide direct heat used in the chemical recovery process.
We have cogenerating assets at all six of our integrated mills. These generating assets produce approximately 64% of the electricity requirements of our manufacturing operations, with the balance supplied from local utilities. Electricity is primarily used to drive motors, pumps and other equipment and provide lighting.
Transportation
Transportation of raw materials, wood fiber, chemicals and pulp into our mills is mostly done by rail and trucks. We rely on third parties for the transportation of our pulp and paper products between our mills, distribution centers and customers. Our paper products are shipped mostly by truck, with logistics operations and procurement being managed centrally in collaboration with each location. Our pulp is either shipped by vessel, rail or truck depending on destination and customer preference. We 
work with major railroads, ocean carriers, and trucking and third-party transportation companies in Europe, Latin America and North America. Service agreements are typically negotiated on an annual basis. We pay diesel fuel surcharges, which vary depending on the mode of transportation used and the cost of diesel fuel.
TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS
We own or have rights to various trademarks, logos, service marks and trade names that we use in connection with the operation of our business, including Hammermill®, Chamex®, REY®, SvetoCopy® and Postmark®. Solely for convenience, the trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K are listed without the ™, ® and © symbols, but such references do not constitute a waiver of any rights that might be associated with the respective trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights included or referred to in this annual report. 
HUMAN CAPITAL
Employees
Sylvamo’s capabilities and potential are delivered through our dedicated, talented and diverse workforce, which we believe is among the best in the industry. We employ more than 7,500 people globally, with 35%, 43% and 22% of our workforce located primarily in 14 countries in Europe, Latin America and North America, respectively. A portion of our workforce is represented by unions in Brazil, Russia, France and, in the United States, at our mill in Ticonderoga, New York. We believe that our relationships with our unions are constructive. 
We strive to be the employer of choice. To attract, retain and develop talented and diverse employees, we work to foster a safe, diverse and inclusive workplace where employees feel welcome, valued and engaged and have opportunities for professional development. 
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is paramount. We strive to design and operate injury-free workplaces for our employees and everyone who enters our facilities. As responsible stewards of people and their communities, we have maintained record safety standards, strictly complying with national regulations such as, in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s regulations. We are an industry-leading company in employee safety. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees and comply with applicable government requirements and safety guidance, in all three regions in which we operate, while continuing to operate and supply our customers. These measures include social distancing, enhanced cleaning and disinfection, frequent handwashing, use of close contact personal protective equipment (PPE), promoting remote work where feasible, and in the United States, voluntary employee reporting of vaccination status. We have maintained appropriate safety measures based on guidance from the regional, national and local health authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. We have continued to operate during the pandemic without any material disruption in our employees’ ability to operate our business in the three regions where we are located - Europe, Latin America and North America. If a new virulent strain of the COVID-19 virus were to spread widely in one of the three regions, it could disrupt our business operations if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work safely and effectively due to illness, quarantines, government actions, or other new restrictions or measures implemented in response to the new strain. Measures taken across our business operations to address health and safety may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of a new strain of COVID-19 among our employees, customers and others, especially with more transmissible strains of COVID-19. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that an inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged and empowered to inspire innovative ideas and decisions, is important to our success. We want to give everyone equal opportunity and celebrate the different perspectives and talents that each of us brings to Sylvamo. We are committed to fostering holistic respect and full participation at Sylvamo for all employees. 
Our senior management team is internationally diverse with global experience, hailing from all of the geographies in which we operate—Europe, Latin America and North America. We are focused on increasing gender and minority representation in our leadership. We have established the following goals that we seek to achieve by 2030: 
•35% overall women representation 
•40% women in leadership positions
•25% minority representation in North America and other regional representation targets. 
We cannot guarantee that we will achieve these goals, and our ability to achieve them is subject to risks and uncertainties both known and unknown, including many of the risks noted in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
To ensure that we offer competitive and fair global compensation and benefits to all employees, we are in the process of reviewing, adjusting and aligning with best practices around all material elements of our employee compensation to further develop our compensation tools and practices. 
Additionally, we develop and recruit new talent through our REACH (Recruit, Engage, Align College Hires) program. A goal of our REACH program is to increase the diversity of representation in our workforce by attracting college hires from diverse backgrounds. Through this program, we prepare early career engineers and safety professionals for our United States mill system to become future leaders.
Engagement and Professional Development
We develop the capabilities of our team members through our continuous learning, development and performance management programs. We invest in our employee’s growth and development by providing a multi-dimensional approach to learning that empowers, intellectually challenges and professionally develops them. For example, we provide continuing education courses that are relevant to our industry and the employee’s job function. In addition, we have created learning paths for specific positions that are designed to encourage an employee’s advancement and growth within our organization. We also offer a peer mentor program and leadership and customer service training to support and develop our employees. These resources provide employees with the skills they need to achieve their career goals, build management skills and become leaders within our Company. 
In addition to fostering a workplace where our employees are respected, included and have opportunities to develop and grow, we support the communities in which they work and live. For example, to build our communities through education, we have contributed a portion of our earnings to support childhood education in the three regions in which we operate. In Brazil, we partner with and support the AIPI Insititute, an educational organization supporting the Brazilian community. 
Labor Supply
Our hiring, training and retention efforts have been, and may further be, hindered by various constraints on our business, including current job market dynamics in which labor is in short supply, and the COVID-19 pandemic despite the measures that we take proactively, such as remote work arrangements where practicable, and those that may be imposed upon us by government authorities to limit the spread of COVID-19. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Executive Summary “- COVID-19” and Item 1A. Risk Factors “- The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly if new highly transmissible variants of the virus were to evolve and spread, worsening economic conditions in regions where we operate.”
CUSTOMERS AND CONTRACTS
We leverage our powerful brands and premium service to build relationships with top customers in each of the channels we serve. Sales are made through a variety of means ranging from multi-year supply contracts to transactional sales. We sell and market our products globally to over 700 customers around the world. We distribute our products through a variety of channels, including merchants and distributors, office product suppliers, retailers and dealers. We also sell directly to converters that produce envelopes, forms and other similar products. We have forged long-term relationships with our top customers, and their loyalty results in very little turnover. For example, our top 10 customers, representing approximately one-third of our business, have been buying our products for more than 50 years on average. Our sales, marketing, supply chain and production staff work collaboratively to provide tailored client support and valued-added services, which we believe helps address the distinct needs of customers across geographies and channels. We provide marketing support to our customers to help them develop their go-to-market strategies by leveraging our extensive end-user sales and preference data.
Well-known global brands and regional producers are part of our customer portfolio for pulp. Many customers are located in a number of countries with much of our product going into North and South America, Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia, Japan and China. We sell directly to end customers as well as through agents and merchants depending on the geography and needs of the individual customer. In some cases, we provide consignment programs or maintain pulp inventories at strategically located warehouses to respond to variability in customer demand and order patterns.
COMPETITION
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive with well-established domestic and foreign manufacturers. For instance, in North America, the four largest manufacturers of UFS, including Sylvamo, represent approximately 77% of the total annual production capacity. As the use of electronic mediums and alternative products increases, and because paper production does not generally rely on proprietary processes, except for highly specialized papers or products, the areas into which Sylvamo sells its principal products are increasingly competitive. Furthermore, the level of competitive pressure Sylvamo may face is dependent, in part, upon exchange rates, particularly the rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real, as well as the Ruble and the Euro. 
Some of our competitors have converted mills or paper machines at their mills to linerboard, pulp and boxboard capacity, which reduces the supply of UFS and other printing papers.
The competitive landscape in each of our business segments is described below:
•Europe: We rank third in supply position in Europe, according to Fisher International as of September 2021, and we have consistently outperformed relative to industry demand in Europe. From 2011 to 2019, while the overall UFS demand in Europe fell by 2%, the demand for our products remained stable. We have a niche position in Europe, with our Saillat mill focusing production on specialty UFS. We have the top brand in Russia, SvetoCopy, and we are one of the two leading suppliers of office papers in the market. We also have a strong position in other growing markets, such as the Commonwealth of Independent States. Our peer competitors include Navigator, Mondi, Stora Enso and UPM Communication Papers.
•Latin America: Our Latin American business is engaged in the production and sale of cutsize, commercial printing and specialty papers, as well as converting papers and market pulp. In Latin America, we are the largest producer of UFS with a 34% supply position as of September 2021 according to Fisher International. Our peer competitors include Suzano, BioPappel and Carvajal. Approximately 78% of our Brazilian UFS production is sold across Latin America, while the balance is exported to other regions around the globe. The use of low-cost eucalyptus fiber combined with our highly effective operations and export logistics advantage allow us to serve the domestic market and the export markets at competitive margins.
•North America: Our North American business is engaged primarily in the production and sale of cutsize, commercial printing, converting and specialty papers. According to Fisher International, we are the second largest UFS player in North America with 28% supply position as of September 2021, including UFS we purchase from International Paper’s Riverdale and Georgetown mills pursuant to offtake agreements. We own two of the industry’s most competitive mills, Eastover and Ticonderoga, with 1.1 million short tons of combined annual production capacity. The Eastover mill, located in South Carolina, operates two paper machines and a chemical pulping system producing 700,000 short tons of UFS and 100,000 short tons of market pulp annually. Our peer competitors include Domtar, Pixelle Specialty and Packaging Corporation of America.
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Sylvamo sells products directly to end users and converters, as well as through agents, resellers and paper distributors.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS
Sylvamo is subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations that are complex and changing in the regions where we operate, which include but are not limited to: environmental, health and safety; climate change; tax; privacy and data security; antitrust; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; labor and employment; anti-
corruption; import, export and trade; and foreign exchange controls and foreign ownership and investment. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting our facilities are routinely passed or proposed. 
Environmental Regulation
Current or proposed laws or regulations may include those governing wood harvesting, air emissions, climate change, waste water discharges, storage, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, contaminated sites, landfill operation and closure obligations, and health and safety matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations in all countries where we operate, therefore, is a significant factor in the operation of our business and may result in capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs. For example, our United States mills meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) maximum achievable control technology (“MACT”) and risk and technology review (“RTR”) regulations that require owners of specified pulp and paper process equipment and boilers to meet air emissions standards for certain substances. However, portions of these MACT and RTR regulations were remanded to EPA for further consideration, and it is possible that future capital project expenditures might be required at our United States mills as a result of such consideration and resolution of open issues with the MACT and RTR regulations.
Many environmental and health and safety laws where we operate provide for substantial fines or penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions for any failure to comply. Certain environmental laws provide for strict liability and, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability for investigation and remediation of the release of hazardous substances into the environment. We are committed to controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities to avoid adverse impacts on the environment, both as an environmental steward and to maintain our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, we may encounter situations in which our operations fail to maintain full compliance with applicable requirements, or we may learn that previous owners of our property released substances in violation of environmental laws, possibly leading to civil or criminal fines, fees, penalties or enforcement actions against us. These could include governmental or judicial orders that stop or interrupt our operations or that require us to take corrective measures at substantial costs, such as installation of additional pollution control equipment or environmental remediation. Furthermore, in the regions where we operate, governments may enact additional laws to protect the environment and against climate change, which would expose us to the cost of additional compliance and risk of potential noncompliance. See Item 1A. Risk Factors “– We are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations and could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations.” We remain committed to compliance with all environmental laws and to protecting the environment. 
In 2018, our mill in Svetogorsk, Russia, discovered and voluntarily disclosed to Russian regulators the presence of mercury contamination in sediment in a river tributary that traverses the mill property, and the regulators conducted an investigation. The mercury contamination resulted from the operations of a former chlor-alkali manufacturing plant on the mill site. Remediation of the river tributary was completed in 2020. We are presently remediating the soil and groundwater contamination associated with the old chlor-alkali plant. See Note 11 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information and the amount reserved for remediation and penalties. 
In 2021, including while we were still a subsidiary of International Paper, we spent approximately $8 million on capital projects in the aggregate for our mills in the three regions where we operate, to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste. We expect to spend approximately $12 million in 2022 and $12 million in 2023 on environmental projects.
Laws addressing climate change may have a material impact on us in the future. The Paris Agreement, an international treaty on climate change, went into effect in November 2016 and continues international efforts and voluntary commitments toward reducing greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Consistent with this objective, participating countries aim to balance GHG emissions generation and sequestration in the second half of this century or, in effect, achieve net zero global GHG emissions. To assist member countries in meeting GHG reduction obligations, the EU operates an Emissions Trading System ("EU ETS"). Our Saillat mill is directly subject to regulation under Phase III of the EU ETS. The EU ETS may in the future have a material impact on us depending on, among other factors, how the Paris Agreement's non-binding commitments or allocation of and market prices for GHG credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years.
In the United States, the EPA manages regulations to: (i) control GHGs from mobile sources by adopting transportation fuel efficiency standards; (ii) control GHG emissions from new Electric Generating Units ("EGUs"); (iii) control emissions from new oil and gas processing operations; and (iv) require reporting of GHGs from sources of GHGs greater than 25,000 tons per year. Several U.S. states have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of GHGs by companies and public utilities. These federal and state regulations have not had a material impact on us. We monitor proposed programs, but it is unclear what impacts, if any, future GHG rules would have on our operations. Although not required by 
current regulations, we aim to reduce our Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHGs by 35% and define a pathway to net zero emissions by 2030, although we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.
Regulation of GHGs continues to evolve in the various countries where we do business. While it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding GHGs and climate change in the future, it is not possible to predict the additional legislation or regulations relating to environmental protection and climate change that may be implemented, which countries may adopt such legislation or regulations, or the extent to which such legislation or regulations may impact our business. In addition to possible direct impacts, future legislation and regulation could impact us indirectly, such as causing higher prices for transportation, energy and other inputs, as well as generating more protracted air permitting processes, causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects. We have controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the countries where we operate. We regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on us, our operations and financial condition.
Other Regulation
Additional regional, national, state and local regulations apply to us in Europe, Latin America and North America that regulate the licensing and inspection of our facilities, including, in the United States, compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act that sets health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents, and Department of Labor regulations that set employment practice standards for workers. 
We are subject to highly complex tax laws in various countries in Europe, Latin America and North America, most notably in the countries where we have significant operations - Russia, France, Brazil and the United States - that if violated, could result in significant fines, interest charges and costs associated with litigation. In Brazil, our business is subject to various tax proceedings, including those discussed in Note 11 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities and Note 10 Income Taxes to our consolidated and combined financial statements.
Our global operations subject us to complex and evolving privacy and information security laws and regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), Brazil's Lei Geral de Pnoteçāo de Dados Pessoais ("LGPD"), Russian Federal Law on Personal Data (No. 152-FZ), the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"). These laws require us to comply with a range of obligations regarding the handling of personal data. There are significant penalties for non-compliance including monetary fines, disruption of operations and reputational harm. Moreover, governmental authorities around the world are considering, or are in the process of implementing, new data protection regulations. We identify various risks associated with privacy and information security laws and regulations in Item 1A. Risk Factors “- We are subject to information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company, customer, employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes.”
Our operations around the world are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. 
For further information about the regulatory risks of our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors “- Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and other government requirement that may change in significant ways, and the cost of compliance with such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.” 
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE MATTERS
Sylvamo’s commitment to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters is a core value of our company. We incorporate ESG considerations into our strategies and everyday processes as we seek to adequately address risks, operate sustainably and responsibly and create long-term value. Our commitment to sustainability spans our value chain, from the responsible sourcing of raw materials, to the safety of our employees, to using renewable energy and ensuring the recyclability of our products. We believe that operating in this manner enhances our competitive position with our customers, increases our desirability as an investment and helps engender employee pride in the company, helping us achieve our vision to be the world’s paper company: the employer, supplier and investment of choice.
Sylvamo recognizes the environmental, social and economic values of forested landscapes. We seek to play an active role in preventing deforestation and forest degradation, promoting and increasing the use of responsibly managed forests, and meeting market demand for sustainably certified products, through our efforts described below.
Our operations strive to incorporate responsible forest stewardship to ensure healthy and productive forest ecosystems for generations to come. For example, we promote healthy and productive forest ecosystems by sourcing 100% of our fiber from sustainably managed forests and aiming to conserve, enhance or restore 250,000 acres of ecologically significant forestland globally by 2030.
We maintain longstanding partnerships with several of the world’s largest and most respected environmental and conservation organizations to restore and protect forests and advance the understanding of the role of forests as natural climate solutions. We also work with our suppliers to aid their efforts in developing actions that improve forest management and fiber procurement practices. We believe that these strategic informal partnerships are essential to achieve the scale necessary for positive long-term impact and to develop sustainable solutions that address critical regional and global forestry issues.
We support and use third-party certification of sustainable forest management through forest certification and chain-of-custody systems, and work to continue to meet our customer’s demand for certified-fiber products. Sylvamo follows these credible certification systems: Forest Stewardship Council, the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI®), the Canadian Standards Association Group Sustainable Forest Management System, the Brazilian Forest Certification Program, and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification. We source 53% of our wood from forests certified under these programs.
Currently, Sylvamo’s mills generate more than 78% of the energy used in the mills from carbon-neutral biomass residuals, which minimizes the use of fossil fuels that our company would otherwise use in its operations. For more than a century, Sylvamo’s mills have been leaders in the use of renewable energy. For example, in 2012 our mill in Mogi Guaçu, Brazil completed the construction of a biomass boiler. This high-return, cost savings project reduced fossil fuel use by 75%. Our mill in Saillat, France, was the first French mill to obtain Eco-label certification for copy and graphic papers. The EU Ecolabel was launched in 1992 by the European Commission. PEFC-certified since 2006, Saillat implements rigorous sustainable practices. All of its wood comes from controlled sources, it is 85% energy self-sufficient, and it produces 53% fewer carbon emissions from fossil fuels than the average of the European graphic papers sector. Saillat and its partner Dalkia, a French energy company, were selected by the French Ministry of Ecological Transition to promote renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Under this program, Saillat and Dalkia will produce 25 mega-watts of biomass energy for a 20-year fixed price, reducing Saillat’s energy costs and consumption of fossil fuels. 
Since 2010, our mills have reduced absolute Scope I and II greenhouse gas emissions by 38%, or 850,000 tons of CO2. We plan to define a pathway to net zero emissions and seek to achieve an incremental 35% reduction in our mills’ Scope I, II and III emissions by 2030 as compared against a 2019 baseline. 
We are committed to maintaining effective sustainability oversight and management practices. Within our company, we are in the process of reviewing various of our strategies, initiatives, policies and communications regarding sustainability and other related matters, and we report upon these matters to the board of directors and its committees.
Climate Change
Sylvamo recognizes that the climate is changing. Because the greenhouse gasses carbon dioxide and methane trap higher amounts of heat in the atmosphere than many other atmospheric gasses and remain in the atmosphere for years, we believe it is prudent to reduce those emissions. Sylvamo seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within its footprint, by working to reduce our Scope I, II and III emissions as noted above, and by advancing a lower-carbon economy by designing 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable papers that people depend on for education, communication and entertainment. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We hold a number of foreign and domestic trademarks, trademark applications, trade names, patents, patent applications and licenses relating to our business, our products and our production processes. We have registered trademarks for many of our brand name products. Key brands include Accent®, Ballet®, Chambril®, Chamex®, Chamequinho®, DRM®, Great White®, Hammermill®, Jetstar®, Postmark®, Pro-Design ®, REY®, Springhill®, and Svetocopy®. Our brands are important to our business and are recognized for quality and reliability. We have multiple U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Our patent portfolio, consisting primarily of utility patents relating to our products and manufacturing operations, is important to our operations as a whole. Our intellectual property has various expiration dates.
SEASONALITY
Sylvamo’s sales exhibit some seasonality, with an increase in sales in the third and fourth quarter in connection with back-to-school purchases.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This annual report on Form 10-K contains information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements forecast or state expectations concerning future events. These statements often can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They typically use words such as “anticipate,” “assume,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “should,” “will” and other words and terms of similar meaning, or they are tied to future periods in connection with discussions of the Company’s performance.
