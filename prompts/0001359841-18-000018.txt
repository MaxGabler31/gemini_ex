Item 1. | Business

Company Overview
Hanesbrands Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, “Hanesbrands,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is a socially responsible leading marketer of everyday basic innerwear and activewear apparel in the Americas, Europe, Australia and Asia/Pacific under some of the world’s strongest apparel brands, including Hanes, Champion, Bonds, Maidenform, DIM, Bali, Playtex, JMS/Just My Size, Nur Die/Nur Der, L’eggs, Lovable, Wonderbra, Berlei, Gear for Sports and Alternative.
Unlike most apparel companies, Hanesbrands primarily operates its own manufacturing facilities. More than 70 percent of the apparel units that we sell are manufactured in our own plants or those of dedicated contractors. Our products are marketed to consumers shopping in mass merchants, mid-tier and department stores, specialty stores, e-commerce sites and our own consumer directed operations, which includes our outlet stores, retail stores and e-commerce sites.
We have a long history of innovation, product excellence and brand recognition and we are now using our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy to integrate our brand superiority, industry-leading innovation and low-cost global supply chain to provide higher value products while lowering production costs. Our Tagless apparel platform, ComfortFlex Fit bra platform, ComfortBlend fabric platform, temperature-control X-Temp fabric platform and FreshIQ advanced odor protection technology fabric platform incorporate big-idea innovation to span across brands, product categories, business segments, retailer and distribution channels and geographies.
We take great pride in our strong reputation for ethical business practices and the success of our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility program for community and environmental improvement. Hanesbrands was a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award winner every year from 2012-2017 and Partner of the Year winner in 2010 and 2011. We are committed to the responsible management of energy, carbon emissions, water, wastewater, chemicals, solid waste and recycled materials in all of our facilities worldwide, and we report our progress annually. We are also a recognized leader for our community-building, philanthropy and workplace practices. More information about our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility initiatives may be found at www.HanesForGood.com.
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. All references to “2017”, “2016” and “2015” relate to the 52 week fiscal years ended on December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. A significant subsidiary of ours, Hanes Holdings Lux S.à.r.l. (formerly named DBA Lux Holding S.A.) (“Hanes Europe Innerwear”), had a 53 week fiscal year ended on January 2, 2016 as a result of aligning Hanes Europe Innerwear’s year end with ours in the year after acquisition. The difference in reporting one additional week of financial information for Hanes Europe Innerwear did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
Our Brands
Our portfolio of leading brands is designed to address the needs and wants of various consumer segments across a broad range of basic apparel products. Each of our brands has a unique consumer positioning that distinguishes it from its competitors and guides its advertising and product development. We discuss some of our most important brands in more detail below.
Hanes is the largest and most widely recognized brand in our portfolio. Hanes is the number one selling apparel brand in the U.S. and is found in eight out of 10 U.S. households. The Hanes brand covers all of our product categories, including men’s, women’s and children’s underwear, bras, socks, T-shirts, fleece, shapewear and sheer hosiery. Hanes stands for outstanding comfort, style and value. Hanes is one of the most widely distributed brands in apparel, with a presence across mass merchandise retailers, e-commerce sites, discount stores and department stores. Through collaborations with third parties, the brand has also gained distribution with specialty retailers like Supreme and Urban Outfitters and in high end retail establishments like Nordstrom, Barneys and Colette.
Champion is our second-largest brand. For nearly 100 years, Champion has been known for authentic American style and performance and helped pioneer some of the most important innovations in athleticwear, including reverse weave sweatshirts, mesh practice uniforms and sports bras. Champion athleticwear can be found in sporting goods retailers, e-commerce sites, department stores, college bookstores and specialty retailers, including Urban Outfitters, Zumiez and PacSun. In addition, we distribute a full line of men’s, women’s and children’s C9 Champion products exclusively through Target Corporation (“Target”) stores. Champion has collaborated with designers and other iconic brands around the world, including Todd Snyder, Supreme, Off-White and Beams. The Champion brand’s momentum has been fueled by distribution growth and expansion of Champion retail stores across Europe and Asia. As we prepare for the brand’s centennial celebration, the Champion brand is poised to be a powerful global growth platform for Hanesbrands.

Our brand portfolio also includes a number of iconic intimate apparel brands. Bonds is an over century-old brand that is the number one brand of men’s underwear, women’s underwear, children’s underwear and socks in Australia. Maidenform is America’s number one shapewear brand and has been trusted for stylish, modern bras, panties and shapewear since 1922. DIM is a flagship European brand and a mass market leader in hosiery, men’s underwear, intimate apparel and socks in France. Bali offers a range of bras, panties and shapewear sold in the department store channel and is the number one bra brand in department stores. The Playtex brand is a recognized industry leader in supportive bras designed for the curvy woman and is sold everywhere from mass merchandise retailers to department stores. 
In addition, we offer a variety of products under the following well-known brands: JMS/Just My Size, Nur Die/Nur Der, L’eggs, Lovable, Wonderbra, Berlei, Gear for Sports and Alternative.
These brands serve to round out our product offerings, allowing us to give consumers a variety of options to meet their diverse needs.
Our Segments
In the first quarter of 2017, we realigned our reporting segments to reflect the new model under which the business will be managed and results will be reviewed by the chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker. The former Direct to Consumer segment, which consisted of our U.S. value-based (“outlet”) stores, legacy catalog business and U.S. retail Internet operations, was eliminated. Our U.S. retail Internet operations, which sells products directly to consumers, is now reported in the respective Innerwear and Activewear segments. Other consists of our U.S. value-based (“outlet”) stores, U.S. hosiery business (previously reported in the Innerwear segment) and legacy catalog operations. Prior year segment sales and operating profit results have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.
Our operations are managed and reported in three operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Activewear and International. These segments are organized principally by product category and geographic location. Each segment has its own management that is responsible for the operations of the segment’s businesses, but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms.
The following table summarizes our operating segments by product category:

Segment | Primary Products | Primary Brands 
Innerwear | Men’s underwear, women’s panties, children’s underwear and socks | Hanes, Champion, Maidenform, Bali, JMS/Just My Size, Polo Ralph Lauren* 
Intimate apparel, such as bras and shapewear | Maidenform, Bali, Playtex, Hanes, JMS/Just My Size, DKNY,* Donna Karan*

We are a leader in the activewear market through our Champion, Hanes and JMS/Just My Size brands, where we sell products such as T-shirts and fleece to both retailers and wholesalers. In addition to activewear for men and women, Champion provides uniforms for athletic programs and includes an apparel program, C9 Champion, at Target stores. We also license our Champion name for footwear and sports accessories. In our branded printwear category, we supply our T-shirts, sport shirts and fleece products, including brands such as Hanes, Champion and Hanes Beefy-T, to customers, primarily wholesalers, who then resell to screen printers and embellishers. We sell licensed logo apparel in the mass retail channel and in collegiate bookstores and other channels under our Gear for Sports and Champion brands. We also sell licensed collegiate logo apparel primarily in the mass retail channel under our Knights Apparel brand. We also offer a range of quality, comfortable clothing for men, women and children marketed under the Hanes and JMS/Just My Size brands. In 2017, we expanded our activewear offerings with the acquisition of the Alternative brand, a better basics lifestyle brand for men and women that is sold to the embellishment channel and the retail, online and consumer directed channels.

Our largest international markets are Europe, Australia, Japan, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil.
Customers and Distribution Channels
In 2017, approximately 68% of our net sales were to customers in the United States and approximately 32% were to customers outside the United States. Domestically, approximately 81% of our net sales were wholesale sales to retailers, 15% were consumer directed and 4% were wholesale sales to wholesalers and third party embellishers. We have well-established relationships with some of the largest apparel retailers in the world. Our largest customers are Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”) and Target, accounting for 18% and 13%, respectively, of our total net sales in 2017. As is common in the basic apparel industry, we generally do not have purchase agreements that obligate our customers to purchase our products. However, the majority of our key customer relationships have been in place for 10 years or more. Wal-Mart and Target are our only customers with sales that exceed 10% of our total net sales in 2017. In our Innerwear segment, Wal-Mart accounted for 34% of net sales and Target accounted for 17% of net sales during 2017. In our Activewear segment, Target accounted for 25% of net sales and Wal-Mart accounted for 16% of net sales.
Sales to the mass merchant channel in the United States accounted for approximately 31% of our total net sales in 2017. We sell all of our product categories in this channel, including our Hanes, Champion, Playtex, Maidenform and JMS/Just My Size brands, as well as licensed logo apparel. Mass merchants feature high-volume, low-cost sales of basic apparel items along with a diverse variety of consumer goods products, such as grocery and drug products and other hard lines, and are characterized by large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target. Our largest mass merchant customer is Wal-Mart, which accounted for approximately 18% of our total net sales in 2017.
Sales to the mid-tier and department stores channel in the United States accounted for approximately 8% of our total net sales in 2017. Mid-tier stores target a higher-income consumer than mass merchants, focus more of their sales on apparel items rather than other consumer goods such as grocery and drug products and are characterized by large retailers such as Kohl’s, J.C. Penney Company, Inc. and Sears Holdings Corporation. We sell all of our product categories in this channel. Traditional department stores target higher-income consumers and carry more high-end, fashion conscious products than mid-tier stores or mass merchants and tend to operate in higher-income areas and commercial centers. Traditional department stores are characterized by large retailers such as Macy’s, Inc. and Belk, Inc. We sell products in our intimate apparel, underwear, socks, hosiery and activewear categories through department stores. 
Sales in the consumer directed channel in the United States accounted for approximately 10% of our total net sales in 2017. We sell products that span across the Innerwear and Activewear product categories in the e-commerce environment through our owned e-commerce websites and through pure play e-commerce sites, such as Amazon. We also sell a range of our products through our retail and value-based outlet stores, as well as through the e-commerce sites of our brick and mortar retail customers.

Sales in other channels in the United States represented approximately 19% of our total net sales in 2017. We sell T-shirts, golf and sport shirts and fleece sweatshirts to wholesalers and third party embellishers primarily under our Hanes, Champion and Hanes Beefy-T brands. We also sell a significant range of our underwear, activewear and socks products under the Champion brand to wholesale clubs, such as Costco Wholesale Corporation, and sporting goods stores, such as DICK’S Sporting Goods.

We sell products that span across our Innerwear and Activewear segments to the U.S. military for sale to servicemen and servicewomen and through discount retailers, such as the Dollar General Corporation.
Sales in our International segment represented approximately 32% of our total net sales in 2017, and included sales in Europe, Australia, Asia, Latin America and Canada. We also have offices in each of these markets, as well as the Philippines, Thailand, Argentina, South Africa and Central America. Internationally, approximately 69% of our net sales were wholesale sales to retailers and 31% of our net sales were consumer directed sales through our owned retail stores and e-commerce sites. For more information about our sales on a geographic basis, see Note, “Geographic Area Information,” to our consolidated financial statements.
Manufacturing, Sourcing and Distribution
During 2017, approximately 73% of units sold were from finished goods manufactured through a combination of facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and operated by third party contractors who perform some of the steps in the manufacturing process for us, such as dyeing, cutting and/or sewing. We sourced the remainder of our finished goods from third party manufacturers who supply us with finished products based on our designs. In making decisions about the location of manufacturing operations and third party sources of supply, we consider a number of factors, including labor, local operating costs, geopolitical factors, product quality, regional infrastructure, applicable quotas and duties and freight costs. We believe that our balanced approach to product supply, which relies on a combination of owned, contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions, increases the efficiency of our operations, reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply.
Finished Goods That Are Manufactured by Hanesbrands
The manufacturing process for the finished goods that we manufacture begins with raw materials we obtain from suppliers. The principal raw materials in our product categories are cotton and synthetics. Cotton and synthetic materials are typically spun into yarn by our suppliers, which is then knitted into cotton, synthetic and blended fabrics. We source all of our yarn requirements from large-scale domestic and international suppliers. To a lesser extent, we purchase fabric from several domestic and international suppliers in conjunction with scheduled production. In addition to cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles, we use thread, narrow elastic and trim for product identification, buttons, zippers, snaps and lace. These fabrics are cut and sewn into finished products, either by us or by third party contractors. We currently operate 50 manufacturing facilities. Most of our cutting and sewing operations are strategically located in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin. Alternate sources of these materials and services are readily available.
Finished Goods That Are Manufactured by Third Parties
In addition to our own manufacturing capabilities, we also source finished goods we design from third-party manufacturers, also referred to as “turnkey products.” Many of these turnkey products are sourced from international suppliers by our strategic sourcing hubs in Asia.
All contracted and sourced manufacturing must meet our high quality standards. Further, all contractors and third-party manufacturers must be preaudited and adhere to our strict supplier and business practices guidelines. These requirements provide strict standards that, among other things, cover hours of work, age of workers, health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws and Hanesbrands’ standards. Each new supplier must be inspected and agree to comprehensive compliance terms prior to commencing any production on our behalf. We audit compliance with these standards against our 265 question, scored audit protocol using both internal and external audit teams. We are also a fully accredited participating company in the Fair Labor Association. For more information, visit www.HanesForGood.com.
Distribution
As of December 30, 2017, we distributed our products from 43 distribution centers. These facilities include 14 facilities located in the United States and 29 facilities located outside the United States in regions primarily where we sell our products. We internally manage and operate 32 of these facilities, and we use third party logistics providers who operate the other 11 facilities on our behalf. International distribution operations use a combination of third party logistics providers, as well as owned and operated distribution operations, to distribute goods to our various international markets.

Inventory
Effective inventory management is key to our success. Because our customers generally do not purchase our products under long-term supply contracts, but rather on a purchase order basis, effective inventory management requires close coordination with the customer base. We seek to ensure that products are available to meet customer demands while effectively managing inventory levels. We employ various types of inventory management techniques that include collaborative forecasting and planning, supplier-managed inventory, key event management and various forms of replenishment management processes. Our supplier-managed inventory initiative is intended to shift raw material ownership and management to our suppliers until consumption, freeing up cash and improving response time. We have demand management planners in our customer management group who work closely with customers to develop demand forecasts that are passed to the supply chain. We also have professionals within the customer management group who coordinate daily with our larger customers to help ensure that our customers’ planned inventory levels are in fact available at their individual retail outlets. Additionally, within our supply chain organization we have dedicated professionals who translate the demand forecast into our inventory strategy and specific production plans. These individuals work closely with our customer management team to balance inventory investment/exposure with customer service targets.
Seasonality and Other Factors
Our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. For instance, we generally have higher sales during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather, which benefits certain product categories such as fleece. Our diverse range of product offerings, however, provides some mitigation to the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. Sales levels in any period are also impacted by customer decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand. Our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us. Media, advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions.
Product Innovation and Marketing
A significant component of our margin-enhancing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is our strong product research and development and innovation capabilities. From 2015 to 2017, we spent nearly $198 million on design, research and product development, including the development of new and improved products, including our Tagless apparel platform, ComfortFlex Fit bra platform, ComfortBlend fabric platform, temperature-control X-Temp fabric platform and FreshIQ advanced odor protection technology fabric platform.
Driving innovation platforms across brands and categories is a major element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy as it enables us to meet key consumer needs and leverage advertising dollars. During 2017, our advertising and promotion expense was approximately $157 million, representing 2% of our total net sales. We advertise in consumer and trade publications, on radio and television and through digital initiatives including social media, online video and mobile platforms on the Internet. We also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media and television. 
Competition
The basic apparel market is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Competition generally is based upon brand, comfort, fit, style and price. Our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers. Fruit of the Loom, Inc., a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., competes with us across most of our segments through its own offerings and those of its Russell Corporation and Vanity Fair Intimates offerings. Other competitors in our Innerwear segment include L Brands Inc.’s Victoria’s Secret brand and Jockey International, Inc. Other competitors in our Activewear segment include various private label and controlled brands sold by many of our customers, as well as Gildan Activewear, Inc. and Gap Inc. Large European intimate apparel distributors such as Triumph International and Calzedonia S.p.A Group, as well as international activewear retailers such as Nike, Adidas, Puma, Under Armour and Converse, compete with us in our International segment. We also compete with many small manufacturers across all of our business segments, including our International segment. Additionally, mass merchant retailers, department stores and other retailers, including many of our customers, market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands. Our competitive strengths include our strong brands with leading market positions, our industry-leading innovation, our high-volume, core products focus, our significant scale of operations, our global supply chain and our strong customer relationships. We continually strive to improve in each of these areas.

We market our products under hundreds of trademarks in the United States and other countries around the world, the most widely recognized of which are Hanes, Champion, C9 Champion, Bonds, Maidenform, DIM, Bali, Playtex, Sheridan, JMS/Just My Size, Nur Die/Nur Der, L’eggs, Lovable, Wonderbra, Berlei, Gear for Sports, Alternative, Shock Absorber, Abanderado, and Zorba.

Some of our own trademarks are licensed to third parties, such as Champion for athletic-oriented accessories. In the United States and Canada, the Playtex trademark is owned by Playtex Marketing Corporation, of which we own a 50% interest and which grants to us a perpetual royalty-free license to the Playtex trademark on and in connection with the sale of apparel in the United States and Canada. The other 50% interest in Playtex Marketing Corporation is owned by Playtex Products, LLC, an unrelated third party, whose affiliate, Edgewell Personal Care Brands, LLC, has a perpetual royalty-free license to the Playtex trademark on and in connection with the sale of non-apparel products in the United States and Canada. Outside the United States and Canada, we own the Playtex trademark and perpetually license such trademark to Edgewell Personal Care Brands, LLC for non-apparel products. The Berlei trademark is owned by Berlei IP Limited, of which we own a 50% interest and which grants to us an exclusive, perpetual royalty-free license to the Berlei trademark on and in connection with the sale of apparel in Australia and New Zealand. The other 50% interest in Berlei IP Limited is owned by PD Enterprise Limited, an unrelated third party, who has an exclusive, perpetual royalty-free license to the Berlei trademark on and in connection with the sale of apparel products in Japan and China. Outside of Australia, New Zealand, Japan and China, Berlei IP Limited and its wholly owned subsidiaries have the right to use the Berlei trademark on a worldwide basis. Our trademarks are important to our marketing efforts and have substantial value. We aggressively protect these trademarks from infringement and dilution through appropriate measures, including court actions and administrative proceedings.
Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally remain valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Most of the trademarks in our portfolio, including our core brands, are covered by trademark registrations in the countries of the world in which we do business, in addition to many other jurisdictions around the world, with a registration period of 10 years in most countries. Generally, trademark registrations can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We have an active program designed to ensure that our trademarks are registered, renewed, protected and maintained. We plan to continue to use all of our core trademarks and plan to renew the registrations for such trademarks as needed. We also own a number of copyrights. 
 Most of our copyrights are unregistered, although we have a sizable portfolio of copyrighted lace designs that are the subject of a number of registrations at the U.S. Copyright Office.
We place high importance on product innovation and design, and a number of these innovations and designs are the subject of patents. However, we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, we own proprietary trade secrets, technology and know-how that we have not patented.
Geographic Financial Summary
For a summary of our operations by geographic area for each of the three most recent fiscal years, including revenues from external customers and net property, see Note, “Geographic Area Information,” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that could affect our business, including those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission and various environmental laws and regulations. Some of our international businesses are subject to similar laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate. Our operations also are subject to various international trade agreements and regulations. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, current governmental regulations may change or become more stringent or unforeseen events may occur, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that govern our activities, operations and products that may have adverse environmental and health and safety effects, including laws and regulations relating to generating emissions, water discharges, waste, product and packaging content and workplace safety. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions. We are aware of hazardous substances or petroleum releases at certain of our facilities and are working with the relevant environmental authorities to investigate and address such releases. We also have been identified as a “potentially responsible party” at certain waste disposal sites 
7

undergoing investigation and cleanup under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as Superfund) or state Superfund equivalent programs. Where we have determined that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated, we have accrued amounts in our balance sheet for losses related to these sites. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our remedial environmental obligations historically have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any proposed regulations or remedial obligations that could trigger significant costs or capital expenditures in connection with such compliance.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Hanesbrands conducts business around the world in a highly ethical manner. We are protective of our strong reputation for corporate citizenship and social responsibility and proud of our significant achievements in the areas of environmental stewardship, workplace quality and community building.
We call our corporate social responsibility program “Hanes for Good” because adhering to responsible and sustainable business practices is good for our company, good for our employees, good for our communities and good for our investors. We own the majority of our supply chain and have more direct control over how we do business than many of our competitors. More than 73% of the apparel units that we sell is produced in facilities that we operate or control. We also have an industry-leading compliance program that helps to ensure our business partners live up to the high standards that we set for ourselves.
We have been recognized for our socially responsible business practices by such organizations as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star program, corporate responsibility advocate As You Sow, social compliance rating group Free2Work, the United Way, Corporate Responsibility magazine and others. In fact, Richard Noll, our Non-Executive Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, received the 2016 Responsible CEO of the Year award from Corporate Responsibility magazine. We are also members of the Fair Labor Association, Sustainable Apparel Coalition, The Sustainability Consortium and Corporate Eco Forum.
We have made significant progress across a range of corporate social responsibility issues, but we recognize that there is always room for improvement. We pride ourselves on listening to others outside our company and reacting quickly and responsibly if issues emerge. We hope to continue making a positive and lasting contribution to our world in the years to come. More information about our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility initiatives may be found at www.HanesForGood.com.
Employees
As of December 30, 2017, we had approximately 67,200 employees, approximately 8,000 of whom were located in the United States. As of December 30, 2017, less than 50 employees in the United States were covered by collective bargaining agreements. A significant portion of our employees based in foreign countries are represented by works councils or unions or subject to trade-sponsored or governmental agreements. We believe our relationships with our employees are good.
