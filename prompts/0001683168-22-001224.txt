ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Business Overview
 
On October 1, 2014, Fuse Science, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“we” or the “Company”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with Spiral Energy Tech, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Spiral”), and Spiral Acquisition Sub, Inc., our newly formed, wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary (“Acquisition Sub”). Upon closing of the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement (the “Merger”), which occurred concurrently with entering into the Merger Agreement, Acquisition Sub merged with and into Spiral, and Spiral, as the surviving entity, became a 51% majority-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
Post-Merger, the Company is now focused on developing and expanding the business of Spiral, a development stage company, as described in detail below. While the Company’s pre-Merger legacy business is described below, the Company is not generating revenue from its legacy business at this time, and does not expect to generate revenue from its legacy business going forward.

Background
 
The Company was incorporated in Nevada on September 21, 1988. Since that time, the Company has engaged in a number of businesses as a private and subsequently a publicly-held company, including developing and marketing data communications and networking infrastructure solutions for business, government and education (which business was sold in 2002) and as a “business development company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, from 2007 to 2009.
 
In 2011, the assets of two privately held companies were transferred to a newly formed Delaware company, (the “Delaware Company”). The Delaware Company was developing sublingual and transdermal delivery technologies with applications in the sports nutrition and medical fields for the delivery of energy, medicines, vitamins and minerals. Pursuant to an exchange agreement dated April 14, 2011 the Company, whose corporate name was then “Double Eagle Holdings, Ltd.,” exchanged all the common stock of the Delaware Company for an aggregate of 23,297,000 shares of the Company’s common stock such that the Delaware Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In December 2011, the Company changed its name from “Double Eagle Holdings, Ltd.” to “Fuse Science, Inc.”
 
As described above, on October 1, 2014, the Company effected the Merger through which Spiral emerged as the Company’s surviving entity and majority-owned subsidiary, and the Company adopted the business plan of Spiral as the primary business of the Company.
 
Legacy Business
 
Prior to the Merger, the Company’s business involved developing certain sublingual and transdermal delivery systems for bioactive agents. The technology developed through the Company’s legacy business is intended to accelerate conveyance of medicines or nutrients relative to traditional pills and liquids and to enhance how consumers receive these products. We are currently evaluating the assets related to the Company’s legacy business with the intention of negotiating licenses or partnerships in order to monetize these assets. We are currently not renewing our contract with the manufacturer of our legacy business products in order to allow us increased flexibility in our negotiations. We have also allowed celebrity promotional contracts to expire in order to examine our new model encumbered, as management has determined the value of celebrity endorsements in the Company’s post-Merger business model is limited.
Current Business
 
The Company is currently focused on two business initiatives: developing and commercializing the Company’s SkyPorts drone support technology, and developing and commercializing the Company’s XTRAX® remote monitoring system, each as described further below.
SkyPorts Drone Support Technology
 
The Company’s primary focus is developing technology and commercializing its proprietary SkyPorts drone support technology and Energy Demand Network, or “EDEN”. This technology enables the long distance flight required for drone-based commerce without the need for drones to return “home” every 15 minutes to recharge. The technology allows a drone operator to travel many miles outside of its “home range” allowing for a flight path of numerous miles limited only by our EDEN network of SkyPorts. This network is initially being developed for use in several states with proposed future plans for nationwide deployment.
 
Conventional long distance flight planning requires combustion engines with fuel bladders or tanks that would allow drones to cover large distances. However, it is expected that government regulatory agencies will not be permitting their mass deployment due to the nature of their volatile design. The Company has designed and is currently developing the modular SkyPorts allowing for the recharging of electrical powered drones for long distant flight and commercial applications. Home deliveries and business-to-business applications will be able to thrive regionally with national capabilities, assuming we complete development of the SkyPorts and the Federal Aviation Agency (“FAA”) and other possible regulators approve commercial drone usage.
 
Because this technology is in the early stages of development, there can be no assurances the Company will successfully develop a working prototype or succeed in mass-producing the technology at a cost that is not prohibitively expensive, or that the technology, once- developed, will be successfully commercialized or gain widespread traction with consumers.

Products and Services
 
Upon the completion of development and commercialization efforts, the Company expects its primary business to consist of building out the network of SkyPorts, then executing the business model of annual memberships and monthly access fees for each drone enrolled. The SkyPorts will be installed on commercial rooftops or be land-based, where applicable, in order to allow commercial establishments to distribute their wares or delivery services to offer faster-than-overnight delivery. The range of applications runs from agricultural inspections and monitoring to pharmacy and fast food deliveries. The SkyPorts will be strategically installed and maintained by the Company in a given market, and drones desiring access to the network will enroll in the EDEN program with an annual enrollment charge and a monthly access fee.
 
After enrollment, clients will license our software and purchase adaptable hardware that will enable the drone to navigate anywhere the client needs to deliver the package. Advanced technology allows for this task to be accomplished to within a close proximity of the given target. However, to eliminate errant landings, a “mobile landing pad” will be distributed to all recipients who wish to make use of drone deliveries that require hyper-accurate landings and delivery locations. This will be accomplished through the use of low-level beacons embedded in a durable two-foot by two-foot landing mat that focus the done on a given spot. The mat size is designed to ensure that the client places it in a safe area; if the mat is able lay flat, it is in a good location. We expect this design will allow the drone to land both securely and in the exact spot desired.
 
Technology, Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
The Company has engaged hardware and software engineers, consultants, and third-party manufacturers to develop SkyPort prototypes, with Beta testing expected to take place in the first and second calendar quarters of 2015. The Company expects to have a fully functional prototype capable of line-of-sight flight by the end of the second quarter of 2015, with the development of more advanced units functioning beyond line-of-sight capabilities to follow. The Company currently anticipates building all units in the United States, with the exception of an insignificant amount of sub-components that may be produced overseas.
Market Opportunity
 
The Company’s potential customer base includes any person or commercial establishment that can and wants to utilize this type of drone technology. Currently, customers are expected to be drawn mostly from the home-delivery commerce segment, but there are additional potential uses of drone technology, including aerial photography, real estate applications, and use in agriculture, and any of these users could also potentially be interested in utilizing the SkyPort model. The Company currently expects to implement a commercialization model in which any interested user can enroll for an annual membership fee and a monthly access charge.
Intellectual Property
 
The Company, through Spiral Energy Tech, Inc., currently has a patent pending related to technology utilized by the SkyPort units and support network (EDEN) program that allows for the function of door-to-door delivery and limitless flight time without returning to home base for recharging. The patent application was filed by Ezra Green and subsequently assigned to Spiral. (For a description of Spiral’s patents related to the XTRAX® remote monitoring system, please see “XTRAX® Remote Monitoring System - Intellectual Property,” below.)
Regulatory Approvals
 
While the Company produces drone support technology and not drones themselves, drones and the broad field of unmanned aircraft systems (“UAS”) are subject to extensive regulation in the United States. The Company’s ability to successfully develop, market and sell its SkyPort technology will depend in large part on the ability of commercial drone manufacturers, operators and vendors to successfully operate within this regulatory framework. See “Risk Factors,” below.

Competition
 
The Company’s competitors in the drone support space include Germany-based SkySense, Inc.’s Skysense Charging Pad.
 
XTRAX® Remote Monitoring System
 
The Company’s secondary business focus is on developing and commercializing the XTRAX® remote monitoring system. XTRAX® is designed to measure the production of solar and other renewable energy systems and for transmission of the data via the cellular and radio frequency network and potentially via microwave transmission network or satellite (the XTRAX® unit does not currently have the capacity for transmission via microwave and satellite) separately, or in conjunction with solar system installations. Prior to April 25, 2013, the Company was focused on exploring and developing potential technology for application of holographic technology to solar energy systems, but abandoned that objective after the Company’s planned holography expert retired. On April 25, 2013, the Company purchased the patents and trademarks relating to the XTRAX® remote monitoring system from Carbon 612 Corporation and one of its creditors. For further discussion of the Company’s XTRAX®-related intellectual property, please see “Intellectual Property,” below.
Products and Services
 
XTRAX® is the Company’s patented system for remote real-time monitoring of the energy production of solar and other renewable energy systems and for providing fault notification. The system consists of a central database server and remote energy meters. The server routinely accesses the remote meters to recover the energy reading of solar, wind, geo-thermal, tidal, and other types of non-fossil fuel energy systems. The meter installed at the alternative energy system site constantly monitors the system to provide energy metering and real-time system failure detection. In case of system failure, the meter will automatically contact the server to report the type of failure. XTRAX® can also be used to sub-monitor portions of larger-scale commercial or utility sized systems to increase efficiency and reporting of performance by monitoring "strings" or "lines" individually. XTRAX® can also be used for third party verification of other production monitoring devices. The XTRAX® system as a whole provides automated billing and reporting plus the ability for users to retrieve reports from a dedicated website.
Market Opportunity
 
The Company plans to sell XTRAX® to photovoltaic installers, utilities and owners (primarily residential or small-scale commercial, industrial and agricultural sites) of existing and future renewable energy system installations. The Company believes that XTRAX® will enable us to acquire and validate Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and provide information regarding greenhouse gas emissions that may support the generation of carbon credits. A carbon credit is equivalent to one metric ton of carbon dioxide prevented from entering the atmosphere and has a market-driven value depending on the type and origin of the emission reduction produced. Carbon credits are mostly purchased by governments and corporations which have a legal obligation to reduce their carbon footprint.
 
The XTRAX® Remote Access Energy Monitor System was designed specifically for the domestic REC market, as well as the commercial markets, regional and international production-based incentive programs and for the international carbon credit market. RECs, also known as Green Tags, Renewable Energy Certificates, and Tradable Renewable Certificates, are non-tangible energy commodities in the United States. One REC is considered proof that one megawatt hour of renewable energy has been created. Although electricity suppliers can purchase RECs directly from renewable energy project owners, the market has created a need for aggregators, which purchase RECs from many sources and sell the RECs in a bundled fashion. The Company believes that the capabilities of the XTRAX® unit to provide automated verifiable data presents the Company with a good opportunity to obtain significant market share.
 
An XTRAX® unit may be physically attached to any renewable energy system that produces electricity. The unit records the amount of power that is generated by the given system by measuring the power that passes through the electrical wires of the system and automatically transmits data on a daily basis to servers that host software that converts the amount of electricity passed during that specific time period into “kilowatt hours,” or “kWhs.” When the total amount of kWhs are compiled over the course of a given month, the information is transmitted to a “trading” facility that values the accumulated kWhs produced from the renewable energy system and calculates the number of carbon credits, which can then be traded at prices ranging from $10 to $40 per ton depending on the market.

The Company’s business model is to distribute and install XTRAX® on all new sub-100kW systems in the United States, as well as internationally in order to capture small-system production information. The XTRAX® units will be installed by a third-party professional technician. The Company will not remain the owner of the system but will charge a monitoring fee of $8.95-$29.95 per month per residential client, or more for larger-scale clients or sub metering contracts. Although these prices may fluctuate in different regions, the pricing described here is indicative of the general model.
 
Suppliers
 
While the circuit board and firmware used in connection with the manufacturing of the product are proprietary, all components and parts in an XTRAX® unit are readily available in the market. The Company will provide the proprietary design to the vendor, after which the vendor can produce the boards. Once the Company designs a printed circuit board many companies are available to produce that board. The Company intends to outsource manufacturing and assembly of the XTRAX® units.
Competition
 
If and when XTRAX ® is commercialized, the Company will face competition. Many of the Company’s competitors are larger with more established businesses than us and have substantially greater resources than the Company does.
 
Potential competitors may include Centrosolar America, Inc.’s CentroData monitoring system for residential photovoltaic installations, which offers web-based, not cellular, monitoring; AlsoEnergy, Inc.’s PowerTrack product which, according to their website, appears to be primarily directed to immediately detect any problem in a photovoltaic installation with immediate automated alerts to minimize downtime; AlsoEnergy, Inc.’s DECK Monitoring , a basic residential revenue-grade meter that is focused on system performance; Locus Energy, LLC’s web-based residential revenue grade meter that records performance data and stores it on a website for viewing by the homeowner or the homeowner’s installation contractor; and Energy, Inc.’s The Energy Detective lines of web-based meters, which are not revenue grade, are designed to measure and report the usage of electricity, can be installed by a skilled homeowner, but cannot be used to receive rebates, financing or trade credits.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
The Company’s operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to worker safety, zoning, building and electrical codes, and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements that affect its business. Further, the Company believes that compliance with such laws, rules, regulations and requirements does not impose a material impediment on the Company’s ability to conduct business.
 
Before the Company can complete development and commercialization of XTRAX® units, the following steps need to occur:
 

● | The XTRAX® unit needs to be listed by Underwriters Laboratory (“UL”) or receive the ETL Listed Mark, which tests the product for safety. This is known as the UL or ETL listing. The Company has submitted samples and information to UL, and responded to their questions, however recent funding will enable us to continue with proper certifications. Furthermore, submission of test units to UL was delayed so that the Company could complete certain software modifications and also complete third party verification by an independent testing laboratory of the accuracy of the measurements by XTRAX® units.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company has already made certain changes requested by UL. In order to allow UL to complete their testing and list XTRAX®, the Company will need to provide UL with six units, at an estimated cost of $1,940, and pay UL $14,950 for their services. The Company plans to obtain the listing by the end of the 2cd quarter of 2015.
 

● | After UL listing is obtained, the product needs to be approved by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), similar to the UL listing process, because there are some magnetic emissions from the unit. The Company believes XTRAX® meets the FCC requirements and expects FCC approval will follow UL listing by approximately six weeks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Following the UL listing and FCC approval, the Company will need to get technical approval from the cellular network carriers, which test the product for possible interference with other products. The Company does not anticipate difficulty obtaining carrier approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company does not believe that the UL listing, FCC approval and technical approval from cellular network carriers represent ongoing compliance matters. However, the Company can begin to offer the XTRAX® product to the market, and seek to generate revenues, only after the Company has obtained all of these approvals. The Company currently expects to begin offering XTRAX® units to the market in 2015.
 
Intellectual Property
 
In April 2013 the Company acquired the U.S. patent for a “Remote Access Energy Meter System and Method” (No. 7,336,201 – issued on February 26, 2008, and expiring on January 3, 2026) from one of Carbon 612 Corporation’s creditors for the purposes of using the patented technology in the Company’s own installations and operations . The Company also acquired the governing trademark from Carbon 612 Corporation. The patent covers remote monitoring through the use of one piece of electronic hardware via the wireless cellular network. In addition, the patent applies specifically to any energy generation facility that uses a power inverter to convert DC to AC electricity. By comparison, the Company believes that its competitors provide remote monitoring through the use of several distinct pieces of electronic hardware via the internet.
 
The elements of the Company’s potential product that are protected by the patent are:
 

● | the communication of the system performance data via the cellular network or by microwave or satellite (the XTRAX® unit does not currently have the capacity for transmission via microwave and satellite); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ability to provide real-time energy production values and system failure parameters.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the patent states that the energy source may be a source other than solar photovoltaic. Such other energy sources may include solar, wind, geo-thermal, tidal, and other types of non-fossil fuel dependent energy generation facilities as well as conventional fossil fuel driven energy installations.
 
On May 13, 2013, pursuant to a patent purchase agreement, the Company sold its patents to Endeavor IP, Inc. (“Endeavor”), as well as all right, title and interest in all related causes of actions and other enforcement rights under or on account of any of such acquired patents in consideration for (i) $100,000, (ii) 666,666 shares of Endeavor’s common stock and (iii) a royalty equal to 20% of the net revenues from any Enforcement Activities or Sales Transactions (as defined in the patent purchase agreement) related to the purchased patents pursuant to the terms of a proceeds interest agreement. Additionally, Endeavor granted the Company a personal, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive and worldwide license (without the right to sublicense) to, among other things, develop, distribute and sell the products and services covered by the patents sold to Endeavor. Endeavor is an intellectual property services and patent licensing company whose activities generally include the acquisition of existing rights to intellectual property through acquisitions of already issued patents and pending patent applications, both in the United States and abroad. In the event that Endeavor obtains any revenues from the enforcement or sale of the transferred patents, the Company will receive 20% of such revenues.
 
As the Company’s license to Endeavor is irrevocable, the Company will be able to continue to develop the XTRAX® system if the patents are transferred or sold to a third party. However, the patent describes methods that are believed to be used by numerous larger and substantially better capitalized companies in their solar and other installations. The Company has no expertise in patent enforcement, which could take many years and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Company sold the right to enforce the patent to Endeavor after review with management and outside counsel that the intellectual property rights and the devices were used by third parties. Experts and enforcement/litigation counsel reviewed the patents and concluded that Tucson Electric, Con Edison and others potentially infringe the patent. Endeavor presently has brought actions against two major utilities (Con Edison Solutions, Inc. and Tucson Electric Power Company) and is exploring other potential actions. During June 2014, the Company received an initial royalty payment under a lawsuit seeking damages for infringement of the patents sold from Endeavor.
 
The Company also owns the registered trademark XTRAX®. In addition to the Company’s patent, potential future patent applications, and trademark, the Company also has trade secrets and know-how.
