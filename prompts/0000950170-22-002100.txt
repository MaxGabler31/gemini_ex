Item 1. BUSINESS
 General
Hub Group, Inc. (the “Company”, “Hub”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading supply chain solutions provider that offers comprehensive transportation and logistics management services focused on reliability, visibility and value for our customers. Our mission is to continuously elevate each customer’s business to drive long term success. Our vision is to build the industry’s premier supply chain solutions. Our service offerings include a full range of freight transportation and logistics services, some of which are provided by assets we own and operate, and some of which are provided by third parties with whom we contract. Our transportation services include intermodal, truckload, less-than-truckload (“LTL”), flatbed, temperature-controlled, dedicated and regional trucking. Our logistics services include full outsource logistics solutions, transportation management services, freight consolidation, warehousing and fulfillment, final mile delivery, parcel and international services.
 We are one of the largest freight transportation providers in North America. Hub services a large and diversified customer base in a broad range of industries, including retail, consumer products and durable goods. We believe our strategy to offer multi-modal supply chain management solutions serves to strengthen and deepen our relationships with our customers and allows us to provide a more cost effective and higher service solution.
 We employ sales and marketing representatives throughout North America who service local, regional and national accounts. We believe that fostering long-term customer relationships is critical to our success and allows us to better understand our customers’ needs and specifically tailor our transportation services to them. Our top 50 customers represent approximately 61% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 while one customer accounted for more than 10% of our annual revenue.
Our business is seasonal to the extent that certain customer groups, such as retail, are seasonal. A significant portion of our revenue and earnings is related to the provision of services to customers who serve consumer end markets in North America. As such our business generally experiences a higher level of demand during the time leading up to the December holidays, as our customers seek to build their inventories by moving goods into their distribution centers and retail store locations in the second half of the calendar year.
 The transportation and logistics services industry is highly competitive. We compete against intermodal providers, logistics companies, third party brokers, trucking carriers, transportation management providers, warehousing providers and railroads that market their own services. Competition is based primarily on freight rates, quality of service, reliability, transit time and scope of operations. Several transportation service companies and trucking companies, and all of the major railroads, may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do.

Our service offering facilitates our customers’ desires for energy-efficient transportation solutions and assists in meeting their objectives to reduce their environmental footprint. Our intermodal service is significantly more fuel efficient as compared to trucking transportation, and we continually seek opportunities to convert our customers’ transportation needs from trucking to intermodal. In addition, our logistics offering includes shipment consolidation and network optimization services that seek to maximize the amount of freight carried per mile which reduces fuel consumption. One of the objectives of our investment strategy is to replace older model tractors with newer, more energy-efficient equipment. We also evaluate new technologies such as electric-powered tractors that offer attractive environmental benefits to us and our customers. Our GPS-enabled container fleet allows for our truck drivers and third party carriers to efficiently locate our containers without driving wasted miles. We are an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) SmartWay® Transport Partner, having been awarded the EPA’s SmartWay® Excellence Award nine times since 2008. Our headquarters building in Oak Brook, IL is certified as “Gold” by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) organization. Please see the Investors section of our website (https://investors.hubgroup.com/) for additional information on our environmental, social and governance attributes.
 Our strategy to grow revenue, net income and cash flow includes the following elements:
•Deepen and diversify our customer relationships through a best-in-class customer experience across all of our service offerings;
 •Acquire and organically develop new service offerings for our customers that will diversify our revenue streams and deliver sophisticated supply chain logistics solutions;
 •Selectively invest in assets, such as containers and tractors, to drive organic growth and reduce our costs;
 •Build an industry leading information technology platform to drive growth and efficiency and support future innovations; and
 •Sustain a culture that continues to enable innovation, service and teamwork.
 We are committed to investing in technology to facilitate the growth of our business while enabling efficiency in our operations. Our digital strategy leverages advanced technology for our core operating systems, while investing in emerging technologies to achieve our business goals and enable innovative solutions for our stakeholders which include customers, drivers, vendors and employees. For example, in 2021 we completed the rollout of technology solutions to our trucking field operations. This enables our operating teams to more easily share driver capacity across our terminals and service lines and provides a single state of the art mobile experience to our drivers on our HubPro mobile app. In 2021, we also delivered solutions using computer visioning, robotic process automation and artificial intelligence to create increased efficiency in our operations and back office functions. This included the automation of manual processes, using human augmentation solutions to allow our experienced supply chain professionals to make critical decisions while allowing a robot to complete the repeatable tasks, and developing learning-based robots to drive better decision support to the hands of operating teams.
 We carry commercial general liability insurance subject to a policy aggregate limit, and trucker’s automobile liability insurance with a limit per occurrence. Additionally, we have an umbrella excess liability policy and maintain motor truck cargo liability insurance. We contract with various third-party insurers to manage our business and operational risks and expenses.
 Development of the Business
 We have been a leader in the intermodal industry since our business was founded in 1971. Today we generate over $4 billion in annual revenue, having grown through the addition of new customers, through cross-selling our services to our customer base, by investing in equipment such as containers and tractors, by developing new service offerings, and through the acquisitions of new business lines. For example, over the past several years we have invested in a fleet of refrigerated intermodal containers that represents a new service line for us which we have effectively marketed to our existing customer base.
We regularly evaluate acquisition and divesture transactions as a component of our strategy to enhance our core business lines and diversify our service offerings. Our recent strategic transactions include the following:
 Choptank Acquisition. On October 19, 2021, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of Choptank Transport, LLC ("Choptank"). The acquisition added scale to our truck brokerage operation, enhanced our refrigerated trucking transportation services offering and complemented our growing fleet of refrigerated intermodal containers. The financial results of Choptank, since the date of acquisition, are primarily included in our truck brokerage line of business.
 NonstopDelivery Acquisition. On December 9, 2020, we acquired NonstopDelivery, LLC (“NSD”). NSD provides residential final mile delivery services throughout the United States. The financial results of NSD, since the date of acquisition, are included in our logistics line of business.


Services Provided
We operate the following lines of business:
Intermodal. We offer high service, nationwide door-to-door intermodal transportation, providing value, visibility and reliability in both transcontinental and local lanes by combining rail transportation with local trucking. Our service offering is well positioned to assist our customers in reducing their transportation spend and achieving their carbon emissions objectives. As an intermodal provider, we arrange for the movement of our customers’ freight in containers, typically over long distances of 750 miles or more. We contract with railroads to provide transportation for the long-haul portion of the shipment between rail terminals. Local pickup and delivery services between origin or destination and rail terminals (referred to as “drayage”) are provided by our Hub Group Trucking, Inc. (“HGT”) subsidiary and third-party local trucking companies.
In a typical intermodal transaction, the customer places an order with us and we determine the price and arrange for the necessary intermodal equipment (which includes a container and chassis) to be delivered to the customer by HGT or a third-party drayage company. We arrange for the transportation of the loaded container to a rail terminal where it is transported by a railroad to the destination rail terminal. Our predictive track and trace technology then monitors the shipment to ensure that it arrives as scheduled and provides notification to our customer service personnel if there are service delays. We then arrange for transportation by a drayage company from the rail terminal to the destination. After unloading, the empty container is made available for the next transaction.
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 43,750 dry, 53-foot containers and 450 refrigerated 53-foot containers. We also exclusively leased approximately 250 dry, 53-foot containers.
During 2021, HGT accounted for approximately 50% of Hub’s drayage needs by providing reliable, cost effective transportation services to our customers. As of December 31, 2021, HGT operated trucking terminals at 25 locations throughout the United States, with locations in many large metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2021, HGT owned approximately 1,400 tractors and 200 trailers, employed approximately 1,400 drivers and contracted with approximately 800 owner-operators.
Logistics. Our logistics business offers a wide range of transportation management services and technology solutions including shipment optimization, load consolidation, mode selection, carrier management, load planning and execution, and shipment visibility. We offer multi-modal transportation services including full truckload, LTL, intermodal, final mile, railcar, small parcel and international transportation. We leverage proprietary technology along with collaborative relationships with third party service providers to deliver cost savings and performance-enhancing supply chain services to our clients. Our transportation management offering also serves as a source of volume for our intermodal and truck brokerage service lines.
 Our logistics offering also includes warehousing, cross-docking and consolidation services. Many of the customers for these solutions are consumer goods companies who sell into the retail channel. We do not own or operate any warehouses or cross-docks. We contract with third-party warehouse providers in seven markets across North America to which our customers ship their goods to be stored and consolidated, along with goods from other customers, into full truckload shipments destined to major retailers. These services offer our customers shipment visibility, transportation cost savings, high service and compliance with retailers’ increasingly stringent supply chain requirements.
 In December 2020, we acquired NSD which added residential final mile transportation services to our logistics offering. Our final mile services include warehousing, product assembly, inbound transportation to warehouses, delivery of goods to residential locations, and reverse logistics services. Customers for our final mile services include retailers and consumer goods companies. We contract with nearly 200 agents across the United States who provide warehousing and transportation to support our final mile offering.
 Truck Brokerage. We operate one of the largest truck brokerage operations in the United States, providing customers with a trucking option for their transportation needs. Our brokerage does not operate any trucks; instead we match customers’ needs with trucking carriers’ capacity to provide the most effective combination of service and price. We have contracts with a substantial base of carriers allowing us to meet the varied needs of our customers. Approximately half of our truck brokerage volume is generated from transactions in which we offer lane-based pricing at a fixed rate for periods of up to one year (referred to as “committed” pricing). The remaining portion of our volume is generated based on shorter term transactional lane-based rates (referred to as “transactional” pricing).
 In a typical truck brokerage transaction, the customer places an order with us for trucking transportation. We identify a third party trucking carrier to handle the load and coordinate a delivery appointment. Once we receive confirmation that the freight has been picked up, we monitor the movement of the shipment until it reaches its destination and the delivery has been confirmed.
We offer a full range of trucking transportation services, including dry van, expedited, less-than-truckload, refrigerated and flatbed. We substantially increased the size of our brokerage service line and increased our refrigerated transportation capabilities through the acquisition of Choptank Transport, LLC in October 2021 (“Choptank”). In addition, we intend to deploy Choptank’s best-in-class technology platform across our existing brokerage operation, which we expect will result in improved efficiency.


Dedicated. Our dedicated trucking operation contracts with customers who require high service transportation using equipment dedicated to their needs. We offer a dedicated fleet of equipment and drivers to each customer, as well as the management and infrastructure to operate according to the customer’s high service expectations. Contracts with customers generally include fixed and variable pricing arrangements and may include charges for early termination which serves to reduce the financial risk we bear with respect to the utilization of our equipment. Our dedicated operation currently operates a fleet of approximately 1,000 tractors and 4,600 trailers at 68 locations throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2021, dedicated employed approximately 1,100 drivers.
 Relationships with Transportation and Warehouse Vendors
 We utilize an asset-light strategy that employs a combination of our company-operated equipment as well as assets operated by third parties to transport and store our customers’ goods, which allows us to optimize our investment in equipment and facilities and reduce the level of capital we employ in our business. We are one of the largest purchasers of rail transportation services in North America and generally have multi-year contractual agreements with our railroad providers that specify the costs we pay for transportation and related services, as well as service levels and other provisions. Due to the importance of our relationship, some of our railroad providers have dedicated support personnel to focus on our day-to-day service requirements. On a regular basis, our senior executives and our railroad providers meet to discuss major strategic issues concerning intermodal transportation.
Approximately half of our drayage services are provided by HGT which owns a fleet of approximately 1,400 tractors and employs approximately 1,400 drivers. In addition, HGT contracts with approximately 800 owner-operators who supply their own equipment and operate under our regulatory authority. We also procure drayage services from third parties, and we believe we are one of the largest purchasers of drayage transportation in the United States. Our dedicated services are generally handled by our fleet of approximately 1,000 tractors and 4,600 trailers and approximately 1,100 drivers.
 Our brokerage and logistics business lines are significant purchasers of truckload and less-than-truckload transportation from third parties. We contract with a large number of trucking companies that we use to provide these transportation services. Our relationships with these trucking companies are important since these relationships determine pricing, load coverage and service that we provide to our customers.
We have relationships with several national and local operators of warehouses and cross-dock facilities who provide a range of services to us including storage, product handling and related activities. Our final mile operation contracts with nearly 200 local agents who provide warehousing and local delivery services.
 We require all of our trucking vendors to carry general liability insurance, truckman’s auto liability insurance and cargo insurance. Railroads, which are self-insured, provide limited cargo protection. To cover freight loss or damage when a carrier’s liability cannot be established or a carrier’s insurance is insufficient to cover the claim, we carry our own cargo insurance. We also carry general liability insurance with a companion umbrella policy on this general liability insurance. We maintain separate insurance policies to cover potential exposure from our company-owned drayage and dedicated operations.
Government Regulations
The Company and several of our subsidiaries are licensed by the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) as brokers in arranging for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle. To the extent that we perform truck brokerage services, we do so under these licenses. The DOT prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity. Our trucking subsidiaries operate under DOT motor carrier authority. We are licensed by the United States Federal Maritime Commissions (“FMC”) as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary authorized to provide ocean freight forwarding and non-vessel operating common carrier services, which are regulated by the FMC. Our business is also subject to requirements published by the United States Food and Drug Administration under the Food Safety Modernization Act regarding the use of sanitary transportation practices to ensure the safety of food transported by motor vehicle and rail. To date, compliance with these regulations and licensing requirements has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive positions.
There are federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety that apply to the Company’s operations. The Company is also subject to various federal, state and local laws and government regulations related to employment in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. Complying with these and other laws and regulations has not had a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business.
Custom-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism
One of our subsidiaries achieved Custom-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) certification in 2013 and have maintained it since then. C-TPAT is a voluntary supply chain security program led by United States Customs and Border Protection focused on improving the security of private companies’ supply chains. Companies who achieve C-TPAT certification must have a documented process for determining and alleviating risks throughout their international supply chain. This certification allows us to be considered low risk, resulting in expedited processing of our customers’ cargo, including fewer customs examinations.
Human Capital
 Hub conducts business and provides services to customers through a combination of non-driver (e.g., office or terminal-based) employees, driver employees, and relationships with independent contractors. As of December 31, 2021, Hub had approximately 4,700 employees, which included approximately 2,400 drivers. In addition, as of December 31, 2021 we contracted with approximately 800 independent contractor drivers. We do not employ any warehouse operations staff. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.
Hub’s success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled staff members and drivers. Our executive management team receives regular updates regarding headcount changes, turnover rates, hiring rates, manager training and employee satisfaction. We invest in the development of our employees through our Hub University learning management system, which provides access to a variety of e-learning courses and modules to further develop job skills, increase knowledge of our business, and promote adherence to safety and compliance procedures. We seek to offer a competitive compensation package, which may include incentive compensation elements, as well as an attractive package of employee benefits. We are committed to employee engagement and an inclusive culture that values and respects every employee.
 Hub strives to create a culture of accountability, safety and teamwork. We set annual performance goals for our operations teams relative to collisions and injuries and track performance monthly and year-to-date to ensure accountability. Further, we provide company-wide recognition on a monthly basis for employees who are nominated for performance that demonstrates our guiding principles of winning together, innovating with purpose and acting with integrity.
