Item 1. Business
Company and Product Overview
 
KushCo Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Kush Bottles, Inc.) markets and sells a wide variety of complementary products and services to customers operating in the regulated medical and recreational cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD) industries. These products and services include compliant, sustainable and custom packaging products, vape hardware, hydrocarbons and solvents, natural products, stainless steel tanks, custom branded anti-counterfeit and authentication labels, processing supplies, accessories, branding solutions, and retail services focused on CBD mass distribution, industry education and compliance. As a leader in custom and child-resistant packaging, biodegradable offerings, exclusive vape products, and unique product and service offerings, such as our stainless steel tanks and custom branded anti-counterfeit and authentication labels, we combine creativity with compliance to provide the right solutions for our customers. The ability to source and deliver almost anything a customer needs makes us a one-stop-shop solutions provider. We also provide custom branding on packaging products, which allows our customers to turn their packaging into an effective marketing tool. Our core products sold are in accordance with Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 1700 of the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. The testing standards for certification meet the stringent requirements as set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”). By offering a product mix that is compliant with CPSC, we are able to give peace of mind to our customers and reduce liability on their end.
 
Our products primarily consist of bottles, jars, bags, tubes, containers, vape cartridges, vape batteries and accessories, labels and processing supplies, hydrocarbons, solvents, natural products, stainless steel tanks, and custom branded anti-counterfeit and authentication labels. We maintain relationships with a broad range of manufacturers, which enables us to source a plethora of products in a cost-effective manner and pass such cost savings to our customers. That allows us to offer quick solutions to our customers and ensure that their products will be of superior grade and made with environmentally safe materials. In addition to a complete product line, we have sophisticated labeling and customization capabilities, which allow us to add significant value to our customers’ packaging design processes. Our products are utilized by local urban farmers, green house growers, processors, brand owners, and medical and recreational cannabis dispensaries.
 
Our services primarily consist of CBD mass distribution services through our partnerships with leading consumer packaged goods (CPG) sales agencies, as well as full spectrum creative, marketing, and branding services through our wholly owned subsidiary The Hybrid Creative.
 
Bottles. Our pop top bottles meet all of the child resistant requirements as set by the CPSC. The pop-top bottle is unique to the cannabis packaging world because instead of a traditional push and turn bottle, the pop-top requires a squeeze motion that actually pops the attached top up and open. We carry the bottles in various sizes and colors. 
Bags. We provide an array of packaging solutions in the form of a bag. The selection of bags we provide includes child resistant exit bags, traditional paper exit bags, and a vast selection of food grade safe foil barrier bags. All bags are available in stock designs and are fully customizable.
Tubes. We offer a complete line of tubes in two standard sizes, each available in a wide variety of colors. We believe that we are one of the largest suppliers of tubes to the cannabis and CBD industries in the United States. Our focus and investments are made to ensure that we are able to meet the increasing trend towards impermeable casing, substantially extending shelf life for pre-packaging. The tubes have a positive seal for enhanced freshness and are odor tight for secure storage and content privacy. All tubes are made with food grade, BPA-free, polypropylene in compliance with FDA regulation. We maintain several unique designs in this market that combine tube and closure elements into a single piece that we believe is innovative both in appearance and functionality. We believe that our ability to provide creative package designs, combined with a complementary line of closures, makes us a preferred supplier for many customers in our target market.
Containers. We provide a diverse selection of smaller sized containers composed of either polystyrene, silicone-lined polystyrene or glass. Our silicone-lined polystyrene containers offer durability and convenience by combining the ease of a non-stick silicone lined with the rigidity and clarity of a polystyrene outer layer.
Vape Hardware. We offer a wide selection of vaporizer cartridges in a variety of form factors (510 thread cartridge, pod systems, disposables, etc.) with reservoir materials including polyamide 12 or glass, internal materials consisting of brass or stainless steel, and porous ceramic heating core technology. We also offer a wide selection of batteries to accommodate the cartridges. Battery form factors include button-less inhalation activated batteries and push-button batteries with adjustable voltage settings. All vaporizer cartridges, batteries, and disposable units can be customized for clients, including adjusting colors/finishes, materials, and adding logos and branding per clients’ request. We deliver the vaporizer products directly to clients, unassembled and empty, where the product is subsequently filled and assembled at the client’s place of business by their qualified staff.

Natural Products: We are a distribution platform for products manufactured by Abstrax Tech. Abstrax Tech specializes in botanically derived terpene blends, terpene isolates, water-soluble terpene blends, and diluents, with all products consisting of ingredients from non-cannabis sources. These products are utilized by our customers for a wide variety of applications. These products are ordered through us and drop shipped to our customers by the vendor, where they are then incorporated into finished products by the customer.
Hydrocarbons and Solvents. We provide ultra-pure hydrocarbons and solvents, including but not limited to isobutane, n-butane, propane, ethanol, pre-mixes, custom blends, and dry ice. These substances are essential in the extraction process which produces products that supply the vaping and concentrate sector of the market. We ship these products to customers from nine distribution hubs and strategic vendor partnerships in key markets across the country under a Hazardous Materials (“HAZMAT”) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) compliant structure.
Stainless Steel Tanks. We believe we are the only cannabis industry supplier to offer stainless steel tanks, which have been shown through independent studies to be significantly cleaner than traditional carbon steel tanks, which often leave a trail of contaminants in the cannabis or CBD oil. Our new stainless steel tanks are available in standard LP239 cylinder sizes and are resistant to rust and degradation, are less brittle compared to carbon steel tanks, do not react from exposure to air or moisture, and are pre-cleaned before being filled, providing a cleaner vessel during the extraction process and resulting in a higher quality end product.
Branding Solutions. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, The Hybrid Creative, is a full-spectrum creative agency based in Santa Rosa, California. It serves both cannabis and non-cannabis clients across the U.S., Canada and Europe. The Hybrid Creative’s services include brand strategy, design and marketing, web application development and e-commerce solutions.
Retail Services. Our retail services division focuses on industry education and compliance, as well as building distribution networks of compliant hemp-derived CBD brands across conventional retail channels. Through strategic partnerships with best-in-class sales agencies, this division provides comprehensive retail solutions to leading CBD brands. We believe our partnerships with leading CPG sales agencies is the first large scale go-to-market operation focused on helping compliant CBD brands achieve mass distribution across all consumer channels in legal U.S markets.
Custom Branded Anti-counterfeit and Authentication Labels. Through our exclusive distribution agreement with De La Rue, a global leader in anti-counterfeiting and authentication solutions, we also provide custom branded anti-counterfeit security labels. These labels provide unique IDs to support product serialization and a digital verification system to enable authentication throughout the regulated cannabis supply chain. Our offering provides companies with enhanced packaging, with the most secure visual authentication technology using 3D photopolymer images, unique serialization, e-verification, label tracking, and data capturing capabilities.
Our Corporate History and Background
 
KushCo Holdings, Inc. (“KushCo”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on February 26, 2014. We specialize in the wholesale distribution of packaging supplies and customized branding solutions, as well as the delivery of services, for the cannabis and CBD industries. Our wholly owned subsidiary Kim International Corporation (“KIM”), a California corporation, was originally incorporated as Hy Gro Economics Corporation ("Hy Gro") on December 2, 2010. On October 30, 2012, Hy Gro amended its articles of incorporation to reflect a name change to KIM International Corporation.
 
On April 10, 2015, we entered into an equity purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Dank Bottles, LLC ("Dank"), a Colorado limited liability company. In exchange for the purchased interests, the Company paid cash consideration of $373,725 and issued 3,500,000 shares of common stock to the sellers of Dank.
 
On May 1, 2017 we and KBCMP, Inc., our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Lancer West Enterprises, Inc., a California corporation and Walnut Ventures, a California corporation, pursuant to which each of Lancer West Enterprises, Inc. and Walnut Ventures were merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving corporation, resulting in our indirect acquisition of CMP Wellness, LLC (“CMP”), a California limited liability company. Prior to the merger, CMP was owned 100% by Lancer West Enterprises, Inc. and Walnut Ventures. The membership interest in CMP was the sole asset of each of Lancer West Enterprises, Inc. and Walnut Ventures. As a result, CMP became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of us. CMP is a distributor of vaporizers, cartridges and accessories.

On May 2, 2018, we and KCH Energy, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“KCH”), completed our acquisition of Summit Innovations, LLC (“Summit”), a leading distributor of hydrocarbon gases to the legal cannabis industry. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with Summit, Summit merged with and into KCH, with KCH as the surviving entity.
 
On July 11, 2018, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with the members of Zack Darling Creative Associates, LLC (“ZDCA”), parent of wholly-owned subsidiary, Hybrid Creative, LLC (“Hybrid”), a specialist design agency, whereby we purchased the entire issued membership interest of ZDCA. Following the acquisition, ZDCA operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, with Hybrid continuing to operate as wholly-owned subsidiary of ZDCA.
 
Recapitalization
 
On March 4, 2014, the stockholders of KIM exchanged all 10,000 of their common shares of KIM for 32,400,000 common shares of KushCo. The operations of KIM became the operations of KushCo after the share exchange and accordingly, the transaction is accounted for as a recapitalization of KIM, whereby the historical financial statements of KIM are presented as the historical financial statements of the combined entity.
 
Subsequent to the share exchange, the members of KIM owned 32,400,000 of shares of our common stock, effectively obtaining operational and management control of KushCo. KushCo had no operations prior to the share exchange. As a result of the recapitalization, KIM was the acquiring entity in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The accumulated losses of KIM were carried forward after the completion of the share exchange. Operations prior to the share exchange were those of KIM.
 
Marketing and Sales Channels
 
We sell primarily into the business-to-business market, which includes legally operating medical and adult-use dispensaries, growers, processors, brand owners, producers, distributors, and retailers in states with cannabis and CBD programs. We reach our large and diversified customer base through our direct sales force, our user-friendly website, and the strategic use of re-distributors. Our sales, fulfillment and support staff meet with customers to understand their needs and improve our product offerings and services.  We are able to dedicate certain sales and marketing efforts to particular products, customers or geographic regions, when applicable, which enables us to develop expertise that is highly valued by our customers.  In addition, inside and outside sales representatives, marketing managers, and executives oversee the marketing and sales efforts.  Operational personnel work closely with sales personnel and customer service representatives to satisfy customers’ needs through the distribution of high-quality products, on-time deliveries, value-added regulatory insight, and customized branding solutions and other services.
 
Our marketing activities include brand and logo development, advertising, websites, public relations, newsletters, catalogs and brochures, and all other points of contact with customers and prospective customers. We have ongoing campaigns in each of these areas, which are detailed below.
 
Branding. We believe that we have built one of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the cannabis and CBD industries. We recognized early on the importance of creating a strong, identifiable and lasting brand that would separate our Company from the competition, and resonate with customers. Our logo, our name, the style of our ads, and all collateral material reflect our “brand image.”
Advertising. We run ads periodically in certain trade publications and on specific websites that reach our target audience. We believe providing ongoing exposure of our brand and product offering enhances the value of our corporate brand.
Public Relations. We have an active public relations program, which has helped build the KushCo brand and position our Company not only as a leader in the industry, but as the company with expertise in compliance issues and depth of understanding into state and local regulations governing the cannabis and CBD industries. This expertise is provided to our business-to-business customers to help them stay compliant and operate within all applicable rules. We believe that we have enjoyed great success in our public relations campaigns, and have appeared in numerous newspaper articles, online videos, digital media outlets, and television reports.
Email Marketing. We maintain a list of our customers and prospects, and we email to them regularly. These campaigns may be seasonally based (such as holiday specials) or may be “news” based to act as a vehicle to communicate important information. Staying in touch with our customers and our prospects is another key component in our marketing program.
Collateral. We have designed brochures, sales sheets, and catalogs that we use in our sales and marketing programs. These professionally designed and quality-printed pieces have been created using the KushCo brand guidelines, and help promote our Company while serving as useful sales tools.

Sales. We have a team of sales professionals that drive our revenues. These dedicated individuals maintain contact with existing clients and secure on-going orders, as well as have frequent communications with prospective customers. Our sales team is anchored by Territory Sales Managers (TSMs) that are strategically placed in the field. Each TSM is based in the region which they service. We believe this “boots on the ground” approach allows KushCo to develop deep relationships with the key players in each major market. While the TSMs are out building relationships in the field, they are supported by a Sales Support Specialist (SSS) in our nearest geographical distribution center. The SSS is responsible for prospecting new leads, coordinating site visits for the TSM, processing routine orders, and managing custom projects for clients. We believe this hands-on approach is vital in a new emerging market where value-add can be provided through educational and evangelical sales messaging.
Competition. We face competition from dozens of competitors of varying sizes and geographic reach who produce and sell products similar to ours. Our sales could be reduced significantly if our competitors develop and market products and services that are more effective, more convenient, or are less expensive than our products and services. We believe that we have differentiated ourselves from competitors due to several factors. We have built what we consider to be one of the strongest brands in the industry. We have a physical presence in key states such as California, Washington, Nevada, Michigan, Colorado and Massachusetts which enable us to meet our customers’ demands at a speed that surpasses the competition. We believe we have the highest quality and largest variety of products and services that meet the certification standards for child-resistance as well as our customers’ needs, given our status as a one-stop-shop solutions provider delivering a valuable product and service ecosystem. We believe we offer the best customized branded packaging solutions in the market. Additionally, we believe our size and customer relationships give us significant insight and expertise in our industry. As a result, we have become more than just a supplier to our customers – we have become a trusted partner, with insight and recommendations that help our customers’ businesses grow and thrive. In addition to many short-term competitive advantages, KushCo is committed to continue building its suite of proprietary and innovative products that are exclusive to the company using intellectual property, branding, trademarks, or joint ventures. We currently have three granted patents and several pending patent applications, as well as numerous trademarks.
Customers
 
We service customers across several industries including all areas of the legal cannabis and CBD supply chains from growers and processors to brand owners, distributors, and retailers. As the industry matures, the size of our largest customers has increased by overall spend as well as the number of items purchased. We believe this trend is likely to continue and will benefit our “one-stop-shop” strategy for our customers’ ancillary needs.
 
Our larger customers are purchasing an ever-increasing variety of products, reflecting our success in cross-selling additional SKUs. Our ability to cross-sell allows us to secure improved pricing as a result of our increased scale and purchasing power.
 
We have experienced growth in our large customer base as well as growth in the number of larger customers purchasing $500,000 or more per year. The table below shows our revenue for the years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018 from adult recreational use states in the U.S., medical use only states in the U.S., Canada and all other countries.

Customer Concentration
 
We had two customers which accounted for approximately 14% and 10% of revenue, respectively, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019.
 
Sources and Availability of Products
 
We purchase products and raw materials from different suppliers from time to time on a non-exclusive basis. We purchase all products and raw materials from suppliers by purchase order and do not enter into long-term or medium-term agreements with our suppliers to maintain any particular levels of supply capacity. Our purchase orders are executed on a “spot” basis and contain market pricing, shipment and delivery terms and conditions only. We believe that we have maintained strong relationships with our suppliers. We expect that such relationships will continue into the foreseeable future, but we can provide no assurances that these relationships will continue. Based on our experience, we believe that adequate quantities of the raw materials which are used to manufacture our products (i.e. plastic resins) will continue to be available at market prices, but we can provide no assurances as to such availability or the prices for such materials.
Research and Development Activities
 
During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018, our research and development activities included the development of a new child-resistant tube and various other products. Expenses incurred with research and development during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018 were not material. Our costs to develop products have been financed by internal cash flows and not been borne directly by our customers.

Segments
 
We operate as one operating segment. As defined in ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, we have completed a number of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in the cannabis industry. While we have offerings in multiple geographic locations for our products for the cannabis industry, as a result of these acquisitions, our business operates in one reportable segment because the majority of our offerings operate similarly, and our chief operating decision maker evaluates financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate in one reportable segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
Employees
 
As of the date of this filing, we have 217 full-time employees. Our employees work at our facilities located across the U.S. Our relations with employees remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes.
Environmental Matters and Government Regulation
 
The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates the material content of direct-contact food and drug packages, including certain packages we sell pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. Certain of our products are also regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) pursuant to various federal laws, including the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Both the FDA and the CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall such products and may also impose fines or penalties on the manufacturer. Similar laws exist in some states, cities and other countries in which we sell our products. We use FDA approved resins and pigments in our products that directly contact food and drug products, and our products are in material compliance with all applicable requirements.
 
The plastics industry, including us, is subject to existing and potential federal, state, local and foreign legislation designed to reduce solid waste by requiring, among other things, plastics to be degradable in landfills, minimum levels of recycled content, various recycling requirements, disposal fees, and limits on the use of plastic products. In particular, certain states have enacted legislation requiring products packaged in plastic containers to comply with standards intended to encourage recycling and increased use of recycled materials. In addition, various consumer and special interest groups have lobbied from time to time for the implementation of these and other similar measures. We believe that the legislation promulgated to date and such initiatives to date have not had a material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that any such future legislative or regulatory efforts or future initiatives would not have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia currently have laws legalizing marijuana in some form. We do not believe that federal or any state laws prohibit us from selling our packaging products to cannabis growers and dispensers. See, however, the risk factors in Item 1A - Risk Factors under the captions “Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, and therefore, strict enforcement of federal laws regarding cannabis would likely result in our inability and the inability of our customers to execute our respective business plans,” “States which have not approved any legal sale of marijuana may seek to overturn laws legalizing cannabis use in neighboring states, which if successful, could result in legal action against such neighboring states and have a significant negative effect on our business,” and “We and our customers may have difficulty accessing the services of financial institutions and related financial services, which may make it difficult to sell our products and services.”
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards. As a result, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

· | The last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering;
