ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 For purposes of this Form 10-K, we define an "Active Customer" as a customer who has transacted with us in any of the eight most recently completed fiscal quarters prior to the date of measurement. Unless otherwise indicated, the date of measurement is December 31, 2017, our most recently completed fiscal quarter. Additionally, references herein to the approximately 9 million U.S. households that own a recreational vehicle are based on The RV Consumer in 2011, an industry report published by the University of Michigan in 2011 (the "RV Survey"), which we believe to be the most recent such survey.
 Our Company
 We believe we are the only provider of a comprehensive portfolio of services, protection plans, products and resources for recreational vehicle (“RV”) enthusiasts. Approximately 9 million households in the U.S. own an RV, and of that installed base, we have approximately 3.6 million Active Customers related to the RV industry. We generate recurring revenue by providing RV owners and enthusiasts the full spectrum of services, protection plans, products and resources that we believe are essential to operate, maintain and protect their RV and to enjoy the RV lifestyle. We provide these offerings through our two iconic brands: Good Sam and Camping World.

contracts, emergency roadside assistance, property and casualty insurance programs and membership clubs, for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we experienced high annual retention rates that ranged between 64% and 71%, 65% and 74%, and 66% and 74%, respectively. We also operate the Good Sam Club, which we believe is the largest RV organization in the world, with approximately 1.8 million members as of December 31, 2017. Membership benefits include a variety of discounts, exclusive benefits, specialty publications and other membership benefits, all of which we believe enhance the RV experience, drive customer engagement and provide cross‑selling opportunities for our other services, protection plans and products.
 Our Camping World brand operates the largest national network of RV‑centric retail locations in the United States through our 140 retail locations in 36 states, as of December 31, 2017, and through our e‑commerce platforms. We believe we are significantly larger in scale than our next largest competitor. We provide new and used RVs, repair parts, RV accessories and supplies, RV repair and maintenance services, protection plans, travel assistance plans, RV financing, and lifestyle products and services for new and existing RV owners. Our retail locations are staffed with knowledgeable local team members, providing customers access to extensive RV expertise. Our retail locations are strategically located in key national RV markets. In 2017, our network generated approximately 3.7 million transactions, continuing to build our Active Customer database.
 We attract new customers primarily through our retail locations, e‑commerce platforms and direct marketing. Once we acquire our customers through a transaction, they become part of our customer database where we leverage customized customer relationship management (“CRM”) tools and analytics to actively engage, market and sell multiple products and services. Our goal is to consistently grow our customer database through our various channels to increasingly cross‑sell our products and services.
 Our Strengths
 Our Iconic Brands. With over fifty years of history dating back to 1966, we believe Camping World and Good Sam are iconic, industry defining brands that are synonymous with the RV lifestyle. Our consistent quality, breadth and depth of offerings, as well as our comprehensive range of RV lifestyle resources, have resulted in our customers having passionate loyalty to and enduring trust in our brands.
 Comprehensive Portfolio of Services, Protection Plans and Products. We believe we are the only provider of a comprehensive portfolio of services, protection plans, products and resources for RV enthusiasts. We offer more than 10,000 products and services through our retail locations and membership clubs. Our offerings are based on over 50 years of experience and customer feedback from RV enthusiasts. Further, we evaluate new products and, through acquisitions or our supplier collaborations, offer certain unique products that are developed based on customer feedback, including private label products.
 Customer Database. We have over 15.1 million unique RV contacts in our database of which approximately 3.6 million are Active Customers related to our RV products. We use a customized CRM system and database analytics to track customers and selectively market and cross‑sell our offerings. We believe our customer database is a competitive advantage and significant barrier to entry.
 Leading Market Position and Scale. Camping World is the largest national RV retail network in the United States, and we believe Good Sam is the largest RV organization in the world, with each of our businesses having a distinct web presence through our e‑commerce platforms. Our scale and our long‑term stability make us attractive to our suppliers, financiers and real estate investors. The strong relationship with our suppliers enables us to negotiate attractive product pricing and availability. We also align with our suppliers on product development in which we leverage our customer base to provide feedback in exchange for exclusive early launch periods for new products. In recent years, we have also leveraged our supplier relationships to introduce private label products, which has improved our product availability.
 Core of High Margin, Recurring Revenue. At the core of our offerings are certain high margin products and services targeting the installed base of RV households that generate recurring revenue streams. These offerings include certain Consumer Services and Plan offerings, which we believe are characterized by increased customer engagement, such as our extended vehicle service contracts, emergency roadside

assistance, property and casualty insurance programs and membership clubs. As of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we had 2.8 million, 2.6 million, and 2.5 million participants, respectively, across these Consumer Services and Plan offerings, including those who participated in more than one of our offerings. The increased engagement of our customers in these areas has led to high annual retention rates. Across our extended vehicle service contracts, emergency roadside assistance, property and casualty insurance programs and membership clubs, for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we experienced high annual retention rates that ranged between 64% and 71%, 65% and 74%, and 66% and 74%, respectively. These offerings also include our Retail parts, services and other offerings, which we believe to be stable and more consistent than the sale of new and used vehicles. Concentrating on our Consumer Services and Plans and Retail parts, services and other offerings has allowed us to grow a core of recurring revenue with gross margins of 58.2% and 44.1% respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is significantly higher than our consolidated gross margins of 29.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 Variable Cost Structure and Capital Efficient Model. Our decentralized and flat management structure coupled with incentive programs focused on profitability have allowed us to achieve a highly variable cost structure. Our database analytics provide us significant flexibility and meaningfully improve our marketing efficiency via nimble, targeted marketing programs. We believe our model leads to strong and stable margins through economic cycles, resulting in what we believe to be high cash flow generation, low capital expenditure requirements and impressive returns on invested capital. As a result, we have been successful in generating access to highly attractive real estate and floor plan financing terms, thereby reducing costs and significantly reducing our need for capital. This capital efficient model provides a large share of capital funding at attractive terms for new locations and acquisitions.
 Experienced Team. Our management team has an average of 22 years of industry experience. We offer highly competitive compensation tightly tied to performance, which has allowed us to attract and retain our highly experienced management team. Since 2013, our team has increased total revenue from $2.3 billion to $4.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased net income from $16.9 million to $233.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and increased Adjusted EBITDA from $164.6 million to $399.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K.
 Our Growth Strategy
 Outdoor and Active Sports Retail Strategy
 While we have traditionally focused on the RV-centric outdoor enthusiasts, we believe there is significant opportunity for us to offer our comprehensive portfolio of services, protection plans, products and resources beyond the traditional RV enthusiasts to a broader group of outdoor and active sports enthusiasts who enjoy hunting, fishing, boating, non-RV camping, biking, snow skiing, snowboarding, sailboarding, skateboarding and other outdoor active sports and activities. By expanding our array of products and services to include outdoor products, apparel and gear and active sportswear and gear through several strategic acquisitions listed below (“Outdoor and Active Sports Retail”) to target this broader group of outdoor and active sports enthusiasts, and by enhancing the benefits of membership in our Good Sam Club to provide additional benefits and savings to this broader group of outdoor and active sports enthusiasts, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our base of Active Customers and enhance the long-term value of the Good Sam consumer services and plans. Consistent with this new strategy, we made several strategic acquisitions in the retail space in 2017 and early 2018.

 
  10

 

 Gander Mountain and Overton’s. On May 26, 2017, we acquired certain assets of Gander Mountain Company (“Gander Mountain”) and its Overton’s, Inc. (“Overton’s”) marine and watersports business through a bankruptcy auction. Prior to the bankruptcy, Gander Mountain operated 160 retail locations and an e-commerce business that serviced the hunting, camping, fishing, shooting sports, and outdoor markets. Following our acquisition, we rebranded the Gander Mountain business as Gander Outdoors. As of December 31, 2017, we were operating two Gander Outdoors stores, two Overton’s retail stores, and the Gander Outdoors and Overton’s online business and had 4.5 million unique contacts pertaining to these two brands. We plan to operate a total of 74 Gander Outdoors stores by May 2018. 
 Active Sports, Inc. On August 17, 2017, we acquired Active Sports, Inc. which included TheHouse.com, an online retail component of the business, specializing in bikes, sailboards, skateboards, wakeboards, snowboards and outdoor gear.
 W82. On September 22, 2017, we acquired EIGHTEEN0THREE LLC, dba W82 (“W82”), which specializes in snowboarding, skateboarding, longboarding, swimwear, footwear, apparel and accessories. 
 Uncle Dan's Outfitters. On October 19, 2017, we acquired Uncle Dan's LTD, a specialty retailer of outdoor gear, apparel and camping supplies.
 Erehwon Mountain Outfitter. On January 30, 2018, we acquired Erehwon Mountain Outfitter, a Midwest specialty retailer of outdoor gear and apparel, with three Chicagoland area locations and the flagship location in the Milwaukee area. 
 We believe that these recently acquired businesses will allow us to pursue our Outdoor and Active Sports Retail strategy, are complementary to our existing businesses, will enhance our product offerings, will allow us to expand our base of Active Customers, will enhance the long-term value of the Good Sam consumer services and plans, and will provide us with a strong foundation in the outdoor lifestyle market for future growth, with the goal for us to become a go-to destination for outdoor enthusiasts.
 RV Growth Strategy
 Grow Our Active Base of Customers. We believe our strong brands, leading market position, ongoing investment in our service platform, broad product portfolio and full suite of resources will continue to provide us with competitive advantages in targeting and capturing a larger share of consumers with whom we do not currently transact in addition to the growing number of new RV enthusiasts that will enter the market. We expect to continue to grow the Active Customer base primarily through three strategies:
· | Targeted Marketing. We continuously work to attract new customers to our existing retail and online locations through targeted marketing, attractive introductory offerings and access to our wide array of resources for RV enthusiasts. We have focused specifically on marketing to the fast‑growing demographic of younger market entrants, and through our NASCAR Truck Series and participation at college athletic events and music festivals, we believe we attract an outsized share of younger RV owners to our platform. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Greenfield Retail Locations. We establish retail locations in new and existing markets to expand our customer base. Target markets and locations are identified by employing proprietary data and analytical tools. We believe there is ample white space for additional development opportunities which, consistent with most of our locations, have the benefit of what we believe to be low‑cost land acquisition prices. Since 2012, we have successfully opened 14 new greenfield locations. We intend to continue to open sites that will grow our Active Customer base and present attractive risk‑adjusted returns and significant value‑creation opportunities. Our greenfield locations typically reach profitability within three months. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Retail Location Acquisitions. The RV dealership industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent RV dealers. We use acquisitions of independent dealers as a fast and capital efficient alternative to new retail location openings to expand our business and grow our customer base. While acquired sites typically remain open following an acquisition, in certain 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  11

 

instances we may close a location following an acquisition for remodeling for a period of time generally not in excess of eight weeks. We believe our experience and scale allow us to operate these acquired locations more efficiently. Since 2012, we have successfully acquired and integrated 51 new retail locations, and in 2015, we sold two retail locations. Our acquisitions are typically profitable within two full calendar months after an acquisition, with the exception of acquisitions we consider turn‑around opportunities, which are typically profitable within two to four months. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that will grow our Active Customer base and present attractive risk‑adjusted returns and significant value‑creation opportunities.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Cross‑Sell Growing Portfolio of Services, Protection Plans and Products. We believe our customer database of 15.1 million unique RV-related contacts, in addition to 4.5 million unique Outdoor and Active Sports Retail contacts, provides us with the opportunity to continue our growth through the cross‑selling of our products and services. We use our customized CRM system and database analytics to proactively market and cross‑sell to Active Customers. We also seek to increase the penetration of our customers who exhibit higher multi‑product attachment rates.
 New Products and Vertical Acquisitions. Introduction of new products enhances our cross‑selling effort, both by catering to evolving customer demands and by bringing in new customers. Through relationships with existing suppliers and through acquisitions, we will look to increase the new products we can offer to our customers. Similarly, an opportunistic vertical acquisition strategy allows us to earn an increased margin on our services, protection plans and products, and we evaluate such acquisitions that can allow us to capture additional sales from our customers at attractive risk‑adjusted returns.
 Our Services, Protection Plans, Products and Resources
 We operate through two reportable segments: Consumer Services and Plans and Retail. See Note 22 — Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our reportable segments. Through our retail locations, e commerce platforms and clubs, we offer RV owners and RV enthusiasts the full spectrum of services, protection plans, products and resources that we believe are essential to operate, maintain, protect and to enjoy the RV lifestyle, including, among others: Good Sam Offerings

The contracts ensure the members will have continuous protection during the life of the contracts.

We do not share the underwriting risk of the insurance programs and we receive a marketing fee based on the amount of premium paid to the insurance providers.

 Membership clubs: We operate two membership clubs: The Good Sam Club and the Coast to Coast Club. The Good Sam Club members enjoy savings on purchases at Camping World retail locations, discounts on nightly rates at affiliated Good Sam RV parks and other benefits related to the RV lifestyle. We believe the Good Sam Club is the largest RV enthusiast organization in the world. The Coast to Coast Club provides access to, and savings at, private membership campgrounds and other travel related benefits. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1.8 million members across our two clubs.
 Vehicle financing and refinancing: We market third-party financing and refinancing solutions for new and used RVs and boats through an arrangement with Essex Credit, a Division of Bank of the West. Essex Credit provides the financing and assumes full underwriting and credit risk, and we receive a marketing fee based on the referred business.
 Travel protection: We contract with On Call International to offer travel protection plans through Good Sam TravelAssist, where On Call International primarily assumes the underwriting risk through third-party underwriters. The plans provide 24/7 coverage for emergency medical evacuation, return-home services, emergency medical monitoring, as well as other travel assistance services. Prices range from $60 to $170 per policy per year depending on coverage. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 197,000 contracts in force primarily underwritten by On Call International’s underwriter, Inter Hannover.

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 153,000 issued and open co-branded credit card accounts.
 Consumer activities and resources:

· | Membership events and chapters: Our Good Sam Club collaborates with parks and campgrounds across the country to organize numerous events for its members. In addition, we have approximately 1,200 Good Sam Chapters across North America, which comprise smaller groups of members within the Good Sam Club that share common interests. Chapters hold campouts, plan social events and organize community volunteer opportunities. In 2017, our Good Sam Club and Chapters hosted 80 events, which provide the social interaction associated with the RV lifestyle. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consumer shows: During 2017, we promoted and operated 23 separate consumer shows in 17 different cities across 11 different states. The primary focus of these consumer shows is to promote the RV lifestyle with the sales of new RVs, accessories and destination options. During 2017, the shows attracted in excess of 262,000 participants in total. Our consumer show division acquired three new shows in two cities in two states in the second quarter of 2017. These shows provide a strategic opportunity to expose first time buyers and existing RV enthusiasts to our products and services. To encourage participation by our Good Sam Club members, we offer members a 50% discount on admission fees. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Trip planning, travel directories and campground / fuel discount programs: We help RV enthusiasts with trip planning in a variety of ways. On our Good Sam website, www.goodsam.com, and through our printed travel and campground directory, Good Sam RV Travel and Savings Guide, RV enthusiasts can plan trips by, among other things, searching campgrounds based on destination or particular needs and reading reviews. Good Sam Club members can search for parks that offer the Good Sam Club discount. Our fuel discount program, Good Sam Club Swipe & Save, enables our members to purchase gas, diesel and propane at discounted prices. Currently, members enjoy a 5 cent discount per gallon of gas and diesel at select service stations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consumer magazines: We produce Trailer Life and MotorHome, two monthly consumer publications with an average monthly circulation in 2017 of 308,200 and 182,200, respectively. Both publications are produced in print and digitally and cater to the RV enthusiasts. Each

publication is well recognized in the industry, with Trailer Life having celebrated its 75th anniversary in June 2016. In addition, we produce an annual RV Buyers Guide, which is sold on newsstands and distributed at most consumer shows free with the purchase of admission.

Each of our businesses has a distinct Web presence where consumers can learn about the services we provide, get rate quotes (as applicable), make purchases and interact with us on an ongoing basis. We make use of cross-selling and on-site marketing to present additional products to consumers as they visit our websites and transact business with us. We are active on social media, including Facebook, to support and promote the RV lifestyle, to engage with our customers and to reach potential new customers on an ongoing basis. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Contact centers and technical hotline: We continue to operate two multi-channel, full-service contact centers with over 230 seats in total. RV enthusiasts call, email, internet chat and use social media to contact us regarding products, consumer services and protection plans, concerns and anything else related to the RV lifestyle. For the year ended December 31, 2017, these contact centers handled over 2.2 million calls and responded to over 350,000 emails and social media contacts. With the Gander/Overton’s acquisition, we added a third contact center in Greenville, North Carolina. This contact center has 100+ seats and will be able to handle over 500,000 inbound calls annually from outdoor enthusiasts for Gander Outdoors and Overton’s products and services. Our multiple contact center strategy gives us the opportunity to establish redundant systems and cross training. This provides back up in the event of a natural disaster, power outages or weather issues that can affect any individual location, and allows calls to be routed to another contact center to ensure our customer experience stays at a high level.

  Camping World Offerings
 New and Used Vehicles
 New Vehicles: We offer a comprehensive selection of new RVs across a range of price points, classes and floor plans, from entry level travel trailers to Class A diesel pushers, at our retail locations and on our e-commerce platform. We have formed strategic alliances with leading RV manufacturers, including Thor Industries, Inc., Forest River, Inc., and Winnebago Industries, Inc. The table below sets forth certain information on our primary offerings for the year ended December 31, 2017.

 
  14

 


     Used Vehicles: We sell a comprehensive selection of used RVs at our retail locations, including the vehicle types listed in the table above. The primary source of used RVs is through trade-ins at the time of the sale of new and used RVs. Used RVs are generally reconditioned in our service departments prior to sale. Used RVs that do not meet our standards for retail sale are typically sold at wholesale auctions.
 For the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold approximately 66,800 new and 30,300 used vehicles at our retail locations and through our e-commerce platforms.
 Parts, Services and Other
 Repair and Maintenance: We offer repair and maintenance services at our 140 retail locations nationwide as of December 31, 2017 and perform warranty repairs for RVs. With over 1,500 RV technicians, we are equipped to offer comprehensive repair and maintenance services for most RV components.
 Installation of parts and accessories: Our full-service repair facilities enable us to install all parts and accessories that we sell in our retail locations, including, among other items, towing and hitching products, satellite systems, braking systems, leveling systems and appliances. While other RV dealerships may be able to install RV parts and accessories and other retailers may be able to sell certain parts and accessories, our ability to both sell and install necessary parts and accessories affords us a competitive advantage over online retailers and big box retailers that do not have service centers designed to accommodate RVs and over RV dealerships that do not offer a comprehensive inventory of parts and accessories.
 Collision repair: We offer collision repair services at most of our service centers, and over 30% of our service facilities are equipped with full body paint booths. Our facilities are equipped to offer a wide selection of collision repair services, including fiberglass front and rear cap replacement, windshield replacement, interior remodel solutions and paint work. We perform collision repair services for a wide array of insurance carriers, including Progressive, National General and Nationwide.
 OEM and aftermarket parts and accessories: Through our retail stores and e-commerce platform, we offer a comprehensive range of original and aftermarket RV parts, accessories and supplies, including towing and hitching, satellite and GPS systems, appliances and furniture, leveling systems, braking systems, generators and electrical products, supplies and other products necessary or desirable for the RV enthusiast and RV lifestyle.
 Dealership Finance and Insurance
 Vehicle financing: Through arrangements with third-party lenders, such as Bank of America, Bank of the West, US Bank, Ally Bank and M&T Bank, and other regional and local banks and credit unions, we are 

 
  15

 
able to provide financing for most new and used RVs we sell through our retail locations. Generally, our financing transactions are structured through long-term retail installment sales contracts (with terms of up to 20 years), which we enter into with our customers on behalf of our third-party lenders, which have provided initial, non-binding approval to assume our position as creditor. The retail installment sales contracts are assigned on a non-recourse basis, with the third-party lender assuming underwriting and credit risk. In 2017, we arranged financing transactions for approximately 71% of our total annual number of new and used units sold.
 Protection Plans: We offer and sell a variety of protection plans and services to the purchasers of our RVs as part of the delivery process, including, among others, our Good Sam branded extended vehicle service contracts, emergency roadside assistance and travel assist plans, and gap, wheel, tire and fabric protection plans. These products are primarily underwritten and administered by independent third parties, and we are primarily compensated on a commission basis.
 Customers and Markets
 The estimated number of U.S. households that own an RV is approximately 9 million, which we believe has grown consistently over the past 20 years, including during the last economic downturn. We have approximately 3.6 million Active Customers throughout our RV product lines, and aim to market and sell our services, protection plans, products and resources to the growing number of new market entrants.
 The recreational vehicle industry is characterized by RV enthusiasts’ investment in, and steadfast commitment to, the RV lifestyle. Owners spend on insurance, extended service contracts, roadside assistance and regular maintenance in order to protect and maintain their RV. They typically invest in new accessories and the necessary installation costs as they upgrade their RV. They also spend on services and resources as they plan, engage in, and return from their road trips. Furthermore, based on industry research and management’s estimates, we believe that RV owners typically trade-in to buy another RV every four to five years.
 In 2017, approximately 505,000 new RVs were shipped by manufacturers. Overall, from 2012 to 2017, the number of RV shipments grew by 12% annually. There are two main categories of RVs: motorhomes (motorized units) and towables (units that are towed behind a car, van or pickup). Motorized units include Class C Motorhomes, with prices for new units typically ranging from $57,000 to $92,000, Class A Gas Motorhomes, with prices for new units typically ranging from $75,000 to $114,000, Class A Diesel Motorhomes, with prices for new units typically ranging from $128,000 to $318,000, and Class B Motorhomes, with prices for new units typically ranging from $64,000 to $104,000. Towable units include travel trailers with prices for new units typically ranging from $15,000 to $29,000 and fifth wheel trailers, with prices for new units typically ranging from $35,000 to $63,000. According to data gathered by Statistical Surveys, Inc., which tracks the number of RV registrations in every state except Hawaii and Alaska, from 2011 to 2017, the average annual new unit sales growth of diesel motorhomes, gas motorhomes and towables was 6.8%, 20.2% and 13.2%, respectively. RV manufacturers are now producing more innovative models, such as lightweight towables and smaller, fuel efficient motorhomes. In addition, green technologies, such as solar panels and energy efficient components are appearing on an increasing number of RVs.
 Generally, used RVs are sold at a lower price level than comparable new RVs and the sale of used vehicles has historically been more stable through business cycles than the sale of new vehicles.
 We believe RV trips remain the least expensive type of vacation and allow RV owners to travel more while spending less. RV trips offer savings on a variety of vacation costs, including, among others, airfare, lodging and dining. While fuel costs are a component of the overall vacation cost, we believe fluctuations in fuel prices are not a significant factor affecting a family’s decision to take RV trips. We believe the average annual mileage use of an RV is between 3,000 miles and 5,000 miles.
 The RV owner installed base has benefited positively from the aging and the increased industry penetration of the baby boomer consumer demographic, those aged 52 to 70 years old. In addition to growth from baby boomers, the RVIA estimates the fastest growing RV owner age group includes Generation X consumers, those currently 35 to 54 years old. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that approximately 83 

 
  16

 
million Americans were of the age 35 to 54 years old in 2016. Furthermore, according to the RV Survey, RV ownership is most concentrated among those 35 to 64 years old and the median age of an RV owner is 48 years old.
 In addition to positive age trends, according to the RV Survey, the typical RV customer has, on average, a household income of approximately $75,000. This is approximately 50% higher than the median household income of the broader United States population at the time of the RV survey, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The higher average income has resulted in a more resilient RV consumer with greater buying power across economic cycles.
 Taken together, we believe the savings RVs offer on a variety of vacation costs, an increase in the pool of potential RV customers due to an aging baby boomer demographic, and the increased RV ownership among younger consumers should continue to grow the installed base of RV owners, and will have a positive impact on RV usage.
 Our Camping World Stores
 As of December 31, 2017, we operated 140 Camping World retail locations across 36 states. Our retail locations are strategically located in key RV markets. Generally, our retail locations provide repair and installation services, collision repair, parts, services and accessories for RVs and RV enthusiasts, and 124 of our locations sell new and used RVs. We believe our retail store strategy of offering a comprehensive range of parts, services, accessories, products, and in most instances, new and used RVs, generates powerful cross-selling opportunities. The following map shows our retail location footprint as of December 31, 2017: Store Design and Layout
 We present our broad and deep array of services, protection plans, products and resources in a convenient and engaging atmosphere to meet the everyday needs of RV enthusiasts. Our retail locations generally range in size from approximately 30,000 to 45,000 square feet and are typically situated on approximately eight to 18 acres. Approximately 15% of typical retail location floor space is devoted to a new and used RV sales area; approximately 25% is devoted to the sale of RV parts, services, accessories and products, a customer service area and a technical information counter; approximately 55% is comprised of a service, repair and installation facility, which generally contains 8 to 30 repair, installation and collision bays; and approximately 5% is allocated to office and warehouse space. Large parking areas provide sufficient space to facilitate maneuvering of RVs, and the area devoted to new and used RV inventory typically ranges from five to 12 acres.

 
  17

 

 Our retail locations feature service centers staffed with expert, in-house trained product specialists and are equipped with merchandise demonstrations to assist in educating customers about RV performance products. Our retail locations also provide opportunities to promote a more interactive and consultative selling environment. Our staff is trained to cross-sell and explain the benefits of our breadth of services, protection plans and products to which our customers have become accustomed, such as extended service contracts, emergency roadside assistance products, club memberships, discount camping and travel assistance.
 We regularly refresh our retail locations to enhance the customers’ shopping experience and maximize product and service offerings. New products and services are introduced in order to capitalize on the advances of the RV industry and to satisfy our customers’ needs. Store dress, promotional signage and directional signage are also periodically refreshed to further enhance our customers’ shopping experience at our retail locations.
 Expansion Opportunities and Site Selection
 Our disciplined expansion and acquisition strategy focuses on growing our Active Customer base. We have developed a rigorous and flexible process that employs proprietary data and analytical tools to identify target markets for new store openings and acquisitions. We select sites for new locations or evaluate acquisition opportunities based on criteria such as local demographics, traffic patterns, proximity to RV parks and campgrounds, proximity to major interstates, analytics from our Active Customer database, RV sales and registrations, product availability and availability of attractive acquisition and/or lease terms. Members of our development team spend considerable time evaluating markets and prospective sites. Our prospective sites are typically located on major highways with convenient access and high visibility. Depending on market demographics, our prospective sites generally include eight to 18 acres and accommodate a 30,000 to 45,000 square foot retail footprint and five to 12 acres for RV inventory. Our greenfield locations typically reach profitability within three months. Acquisitions are typically profitable within two full calendar months after an acquisition, with the exception of acquisitions we consider turn-around opportunities, which are typically profitable within two to four months.
 As the market leader, with a scalable cost structure, we have an established track record of successful acquisitions. Over the last three years ended December 31, 2017, we have spent over $290 million, net of financing under the floor plan facility (“Floor Plan Facility”), on 18 acquisitions that included 30 retail locations, at multiples of acquired EBITDA in the low to mid-single digit range. We expect most acquisitions to result in cash-on-cash payback periods of under a year, and have designed an identification, assessment, negotiation, acquisition, and closing set of processes and procedures that allow us to move quickly on opportunities.
 Store Level Management and Training
 Our President of Camping World oversees all retail operations. Our retail locations are each managed by a vice president of operations, each of whom is typically responsible for 13 to 34 retail locations. Depending on the number of retail locations managed by any vice president of operations, the vice president of operations may have one or more market managers responsible for a smaller number of retail locations. Our vice presidents of operations have, on average, 24 years of experience in the RV industry and have been employed by us for 13 years.
 Each retail location employs a general manager or a general sales manager (in either case, the “GM”) that has responsibility for the daily operations of the retail location. Areas of responsibility include inventory management, hiring, associate training and development, maintenance of the facilities, customer service and customer satisfaction. A GM’s management team includes a sales manager, a parts and accessories manager, a service manager, and a finance and insurance manager to help oversee the operations of each retail location department. A typical retail location employs approximately 30 to 110 full-time equivalent employees.
 We employ a national director of inventory and a centralized inventory management team to oversee our RV inventory and provide consistency and controls in the ordering, purchasing and distribution of RV 

 
  18

 
inventory. We also employ a national director of service, a national director of parts and accessories, and a national director of finance and insurance to assist in the management and training for the respective areas.
 We actively seek to improve our ability to assess talent during the interview process and hire talented people and provide extensive training programs and opportunities for our employees, including, among others, new-hire training and orientations, e-learning and training modules, national training directors and certification programs for our RV technicians.
 Product Sourcing and Distribution
 Sourcing
 New and Used RVs
 We generally acquire new RVs for retail sale directly from the applicable manufacturer. We have strategic contractual arrangements with leading RV manufacturers, including Thor Industries, Inc., Forest River, Inc., and Winnebago Industries, Inc., with such manufacturers supplying approximately 78%, 12%, and 7%, respectively, of our new RV inventory as of December 31, 2017. According to each such company’s latest Form 10-K, we are the largest customer of Thor Industries, Inc., representing 20% of this suppliers’ latest fiscal year revenue, and the second largest customer of Winnebago Industries, Inc., representing 10% of this suppliers’ latest fiscal year revenue. We maintain a central inventory management and purchasing group to manage and maintain adequate inventory levels and mix. RVs are transported directly from a manufacturer’s facility to our retail locations via a third-party transportation company.
 Our strategy is to partner with financially sound manufacturers that make quality products, have adequate manufacturing capacity and distribution, and maintain an appropriate product mix. In certain instances, our manufacturing partners produce private label products exclusively available at our retail locations and through our e-commerce platforms.
 Our supply arrangements with manufacturers are typically governed by dealer agreements, which are customary in the RV industry. Our dealer agreements with manufacturers are generally made on a location-by-location basis. The terms of these dealer agreements are typically subject to, among other things, us meeting all the requirements and conditions of the manufacturer’s applicable programs, us maintaining certain minimum inventory requirements and meeting certain retail sales objectives, us performing services and repairs for all owners of the manufacturer’s RVs (regardless from whom the RV was purchased) that are still under warranty and us carrying the manufacturer’s parts and accessories needed to service and repair the manufacturer’s RVs in stock at all times, us actively advertising and promoting the manufacturer’s RVs and us indemnifying the manufacturer under certain circumstances. Our dealer agreements generally designate a specific geographical territory for us, which is often exclusive to us, provided that we are able to meet the material obligations of the applicable dealer agreement. In addition, many of our dealer agreements contain stocking level requirements and certain of our dealer agreements contain contractual provisions concerning minimum advertised product pricing for current model year units. Wholesale pricing is generally established on a model year basis and is subject to change in the manufacturer’s sole discretion. In certain cases, the manufacturer may also establish a suggested retail price, below which we cannot advertise that manufacturer’s RVs.
 We generally acquire used RVs from customers, primarily through trade-ins, as well as through auctions and other sources, and we generally recondition used RVs acquired for retail sale in our parts and service departments. Used RVs that we do not sell at our retail locations generally are sold at wholesale prices through auctions.
 We finance the purchase of substantially all of our new RV inventory from manufacturers through our Floor Plan Facility. Used vehicles may also be financed from time to time through our Floor Plan Facility. For more information on our Floor Plan Facility, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Description of Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Floor Plan Facility” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 3 — Inventories, net

and Notes Payable — Floor Plan, net to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 Parts and Accessories
 The purchasing activities for our parts and accessories departments are focused on RV maintenance products, outdoor lifestyle products, RV parts and accessories, such as, among others, generators and electrical, satellite receivers and GPS, towing and hitching products and RV appliances, essential supplies and other products and services necessary or desirable for the RV lifestyle. We maintain central purchasing, replenishment and distribution functions to manage inventory planning, allocate merchandise to our retail locations and oversee the replenishment of basic merchandise to our distribution centers. We have no long-term purchase commitments. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased merchandise from approximately 1,300 vendors with no vendor accounting for more than approximately 6% of total merchandise purchased. During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 5% of our RV-related merchandise was imported directly from vendors located in foreign countries, with a substantial portion of the imported merchandise being obtained directly from vendors in China. We have established long-standing, continuous relationships with our largest vendors. We believe that the volume of merchandise we purchase from domestic and international suppliers and our ability to buy direct from manufacturers enables us to obtain merchandise at costs which compare favorably to local RV dealers and retailers.
 Our merchant team located in Bowling Green, Kentucky currently manages our parts and accessories sourcing. To ensure our product offerings are tailored to local market conditions and demand, our merchant team routinely meets one-on-one with vendors, attends trade shows, reviews trade periodicals and evaluates merchandise offered by other retail and online merchants. We also consistently gather feedback and new product reviews from our store management and employees, as well as from reviews submitted by our customers. We believe this feedback is valuable to our vendor-partners and improves our access to new models and technologies.
 Distribution and Fulfillment
 We distribute our RV merchandise from three leased distribution and fulfillment centers located in Franklin, Kentucky, Bakersfield, California, and Fort Worth, Texas, which are 250,000, 169,123, and 197,400 square feet, respectively. The three distribution centers support replenishment of parts and accessories for our 140 RV retail locations as of December 31, 2017 and manage the fulfillment of Camping World direct-to-consumer e-commerce and catalog orders. We use common carriers for replenishment of our retail locations and ship merchandise to our e-commerce customers via courier service. An experienced distribution management team leads a staff of approximately 110 full-time distribution center employees.
 We distribute our Gander Outdoors, Overton’s and other Outdoor and Active Sports Retail merchandise from three leased and one owned distribution centers in Greenville, South Carolina, Lebanon, Indiana, St. Paul, Minnesota and Skokie, Illinois, which are 496,443, 707,952, 200,348 and 6,000 square feet, respectively. These four distribution centers support replenishment of Gander Outdoors, Overton’s and our other Outdoor and Active Sports Retail merchandise for our retail locations as of December 31, 2017 and manage the fulfillment of our Gander Outdoors, Overton’s and other outdoor and active sports direct-to-consumer e-commerce orders. We use common carriers for replenishment of our retail locations and ship merchandise to our e-commerce customers via courier service. Our experienced distribution management team leads a staff of approximately 160 full-time employees at these distribution centers.
 Our distribution centers have scalable systems and processes that we believe can accommodate continued new store growth. We use an Oracle enterprise system to procure inventory, manage online customer and retail demand and fulfill orders through the warehouse management module. Additionally, we have customized an order packing and shipping software package to handle the specific requirements of the e-commerce and retail business. We have the capability to both case pick and item pick, which is designed to ensure our retail locations have sufficient quantities of product while also allowing us to maintain in inventory slow moving but necessary items. This balance allows us to stock the right products at the necessary locations, all at the right time and in the correct quantity.

 Marketing and Advertising
 We market our Good Sam branded offerings through retail point of sale, websites, e-mail, direct mail, inserts, paid search, space advertisements, promotional events, member-get-a-member campaigns, and telemarketing. In 2017, retail point of sale marketing efforts accounted for approximately 72% of new paid enrollments in our Good Sam Club. We generally use our internal proprietary database for marketing and advertising. We have over 15.1 million unique RV contacts in our database and 3.6 million Active Customers.
 We market our Camping World brand through the strategic location of our retail stores in high traffic RV areas, in-store promotions, our websites, mail order catalogs, direct mail retail flyers, local TV and radio, RV and outdoor shows, billboards, newspaper, email, paid search, advertisements in national and regional industry publications, vendor co-op advertising programs, promotional events, and personal solicitations and referrals. Camping World’s principal marketing strategy is to capitalize on its broad name recognition among RV owners.
 We currently operate an extensive network of RV lifestyle related websites, including www.goodsamclub.com, www.campingworld.com and www.goodsamcamping.com, that experienced more than 95 million visitor sessions in 2017. Our websites feature RV and RV lifestyle associated content, as well as the ability to purchase parts, services and accessories that enhance the RV lifestyle. We believe our network of websites provide RV owners and enthusiasts with the most expansive access to RV related content and e-commerce in the RV industry. Our websites also allow RV owners and enthusiasts to read about the RV lifestyle, make purchases and gather more information about RV parks and other RV-related entities.
 In addition to websites, our digital presence includes apps and services that enable current and potential RV owners and enthusiasts to research RVs, read product reviews written by RV experts and other RV owners and enthusiasts, plan RV trips (including mapping routes and planning which RV parks to visit) and purchase thousands of products to support their RV lifestyle. We use various digital tools and services to foster the RV lifestyle and to introduce new and/or future RV owners and enthusiasts to our network of websites and the products and services we offer. Our wide reaching digital presence provides extensive marketing for the products and services we sell, while providing the RV community with access to valuable content and tools to enhance the RV lifestyle.
 We also use promotional events as marketing tools. During 2017, we promoted and operated 23 consumer shows in 17 cities across 11 states which are primarily RV, boat, and sport shows. The total audience of RV, Boating, powersports and outdoor recreation enthusiasts who attended our shows during 2017 exceeded 262,000. Our consumer show division acquired three new shows in two cities in two states in the second quarter of 2017. In addition, we have sponsored sporting events such as Major League Baseball, the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races, and the College Football Camping World Independence Bowl. Periodically we promote the opening of each new retail location through grand opening celebrations at which we may have special events and discounted prices.
 E-Commerce Platform and Digital Strategy
 We believe our websites and other digital marketing channels enable us to provide instant, on-demand access to the wide array of content, products and services we offer. Our content, such as RV park descriptions, ratings and user reviews, encourage RV owners and enthusiasts, whether or not current customers or members, to visit our websites.
 We use a combination of targeted email, social media and e-newsletters to promote ongoing communication with our customers and members. We believe that by communicating with our customers and members on an ongoing basis, we build affinity and the likelihood of a continued consumer to business relationship.
 We believe our websites help attract new customers who may not live near one of our retail locations, who desire to transact business online or who are discovering us for the first time. Additionally, we believe many people who transact at our retail locations visit our websites prior to visiting our retail locations. To 

 
  21

 
attract new customers to our websites we use a combination of online marketing methods, including social media, paid search, search engine optimization and other web-based marketing methods. We test new online marketing methods on an ongoing basis. Once a customer interacts with us online and elects to receive our e-newsletters and/or promotional emails, we offer ongoing email-based content delivery and promotions. We also use customer data to enable cross-selling of complementary products and services.
 Our Camping World website works in concert with our retail locations and logistics operations, with orders for stocked inventory shipped from the same distribution centers that support our network of retail locations. We currently offer more than 20,000 products on www.campingworld.com and associated websites, which include products that are not available in our retail locations. To further support sales, we make use of various affiliate relationships, which helps us reach the RV community across a wide array of websites.
 We continually invest in our network of websites and point of sale technology. Knowing our customers’ purchasing history provides us with the opportunity to have a greater understanding of the wants and needs of our customers. Our websites enable simplified access to all Good Sam content and services in an integrated fashion through www.goodsam.com. The Camping World website, www.campingworld.com, features access to product search and optimized product presentation, as well as shopping and checkout processes. We invest in our websites on an ongoing basis to continually improve our customers’ experience, and to increase visits and purchases by new and returning customers.
 Customer Service
 We believe customer service and access to a live person is a critical component of our digital marketing and sales operation. Our sales and customer service centers in Englewood, Colorado, and Bowling Green, Kentucky, are multi-channel, full-service contact centers. RV enthusiasts call, email, internet chat and use social media to contact us regarding products, consumer services and protection plans, concerns and anything else related to the RV lifestyle. RV enthusiasts can also speak with our customer service specialists for help with orders, to receive answers to questions and to make purchases for any product offered through our websites.
 Our contact center in Englewood, Colorado is an approximately 230-seat contact center that is over 20,000 square feet. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Englewood, Colorado contact center handled approximately 2.0 million calls and responded to over 250,000 emails and social media contacts. Our contact center in Bowling Green, Kentucky provides service and support to the Camping World internet and catalog product sales. This contact center also houses a retail support team that handles our retail location overflow calls. For the year ended December 31, 2017, this team handled over 200,000 calls. With the Gander/Overton’s acquisition, we added a third contact center in Greenville, North Carolina. This contact center has 100+ seats and will be able to handle over 500,000 inbound calls annually from Outdoor enthusiasts for Gander Outdoors and Overton’s products and services. Our multiple contact center strategy gives us the opportunity to establish redundant systems and cross training. This provides back up in the event of a natural disaster, power outages or weather issues that can affect any individual location, and allows calls to be routed to another contact center to ensure our customer experience stays at a high level.
 Our contact center specialists are extensively trained to assist customers with complex orders and provide a level of service that leads to long-term customer relationships. In addition, our quality assurance team monitors contacts daily and provides the leadership team with tools to maintain sales and service standards. With low turnover, we retain our employees longer than the industry average, which we believe allows our callers to be assisted by experienced contact center agents who are familiar with the RV lifestyle and our services, protection plans and products.

 Management Information Systems
 We utilize sophisticated computer systems to support our operations, including a third-party dealer management system, point-of-sale registers (“POS”), enterprise resource planning system, supply chain management system, CRM, event business management system and marketing database. In addition, we utilize proprietary membership systems and data warehouses to provide analytical views of our data.
 To support the applications, we have multiple data centers with advanced servers, storage and networking capabilities. We have a secure wide area network that facilitates communication within and between our offices and provides both voice and data services. Business critical systems are replicated in real time and all systems are protected with on and off site backups.
 A database containing all customer activity across our various businesses and programs has been integrated into our websites and contact centers. Comprehensive information on each customer, including a profile of the purchasing activities, is made available to our CRM, POS and marketing database. We utilize information technology and analytics to actively market and sell multiple products and services to our Active Customers, including list segmentation and merge and purge programs, to select prospects for direct mail solicitations and other direct marketing efforts. We employ publishing software for publication makeup, content and advertising to support our publications operations.
 Our management information systems and electronic data processing systems consist of an extensive range of retail, mail order, financial and merchandising systems, including purchasing, inventory distribution and logistics, sales reporting, accounts payable and merchandise management. Our POS and dealer management systems report comprehensive data in near real time to our data warehouses, including detailed sales volume, inventory information by product, merchandise transfers and receipts, special orders, supply orders and returns of product purchases to vendors. The registers capture Good Sam Club member numbers and associated sales and references to specific promotional campaigns. In conjunction with its nightly polling, our central computer sends price changes to registers at the point of sale. Management monitors the performance of each retail location and mail order operations to evaluate inventory levels, determine markdowns and analyze gross profit margins by product.
 Competition
 We face competition in all of our business segments. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are breadth and depth of product selection, value pricing, convenient retail locations, technical services and customer service. Our competitors vary in size and breadth of their product offerings. We compete directly or indirectly with the following types of companies:
· | major national insurance and warranty companies, providers of roadside assistance and providers of extended vehicle service contracts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | other dealers of new and used RVs for sale;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | independent, local specialty stores, such as “mom & pops”;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | other large-format outdoor and active sports goods stores and chains, such as Academy Sports + Outdoors, REI, Bass Pro Shops (including Cabela’s) and Sportsman’s Warehouse;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | multi-channel retailers and mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, discount stores, department stores and online retailers, such as Amazon, Target and Wal-Mart;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | other specialty retailers that compete with us across a significant portion of our merchandising categories through retail, catalog or e-commerce businesses, such as Bass Pro Shops (including Cabela’s), Sportsman’s Warehouse and REI; and online retailers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additional competitors may enter the businesses in which we currently operate. Moreover, some of our mass merchandising competitors do not currently compete in many of the product categories we offer, but may choose to offer a broader array of competing products in the future.
 Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 We own a variety of registered trademarks and service marks related to our brands and our services, protection plans, products and resources, including Good Sam, Camping World, Gander Outdoors and Overton’s. We also own the copyrights to certain articles in our publications and numerous domain names, including www.goodsamclub.com, www.campingworld.com, www.ganderoutdoors.com, www.overtons.com, www.the-house.com, w82.com, and www.udans.com, among others. We believe that our trademarks and other intellectual property have significant value and are important to our marketing efforts. We do not know of any material pending claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use our intellectual property in the United States or elsewhere. Government Regulation
 Our operations are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation, including our RV sales, firearm sales, vehicle financing, outbound telemarketing, direct mail, roadside assistance programs, extended vehicle service contracts and insurance activities. These laws and regulations include consumer protection laws, so-called “lemon laws,” privacy laws, escheatment laws, anti-money laundering laws and other extensive laws and regulations applicable to new and used vehicle dealers, as well as a variety of other laws and regulations. These laws also include federal and state wage and hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws. Furthermore, new laws and regulations, particularly at the federal level, may be enacted that could also affect our business. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations.” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K. Motor Vehicle Laws and Regulations
 Our operations are subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation and the rules and regulations of various state motor vehicle regulatory agencies. We are also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation and marketing of motor vehicles, including so-called “lemon laws.” Federal, state and local laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight, length and width of motor vehicles that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions. Federal and state authorities also have various environmental control standards relating to air, water, noise pollution and hazardous waste generation and disposal.
 Our financing activities with customers are subject to federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, leasing laws, installment finance laws, usury laws and other installment sales and leasing laws and regulations, some of which regulate finance and other fees and charges that may be imposed or received in connection with motor vehicle retail installment sales. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us or our retail locations by individuals, a class of individuals, or governmental entities and may expose us to significant damages or other penalties, including revocation or suspension of our licenses to conduct retail operations and fines.
 The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, established the CFPB, an independent federal agency funded by the United States Federal Reserve with broad regulatory powers and limited oversight from the United States Congress. Although automotive dealers are generally excluded, the Dodd-Frank Act could lead to additional, indirect regulation of automotive dealers, in particular, their sale and marketing of finance and insurance products, through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions. In March 2013, the CFPB issued supervisory guidance highlighting its concern that the practice of automotive dealers being compensated for arranging customer financing through discretionary markup of wholesale rates offered by financial institutions (“dealer markup”) results in a significant risk of 

 
  24

 
pricing disparity in violation of the ECOA. The CFPB recommended that financial institutions under its jurisdiction take steps to address compliance with the ECOA, which may include imposing controls on dealer markup, monitoring and addressing the effects of dealer markup policies, and eliminating dealer discretion to markup buy rates and fairly compensating dealers using a different mechanism that does not result in disparate impact to certain groups of consumers. 
 Firearms Laws and Regulations
 Regulation and Legislation

Because we sell firearms at certain of our retail stores, we are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (the “ATF”). Each applicable store has a federal firearms license permitting the sale of firearms, and our applicable distribution centers have obtained federal firearms licenses to store and distribute firearms. Certain states require a state license to sell firearms, and we have obtained these licenses for the states in which we operate that have such a requirement. 

We must comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the National Firearms Act of 1934 (the “NFA”), and the Gun Control Act of 1968 (the “GCA”), all of which have been amended from time to time. The NFA and the GCA require our business to, among other things, maintain federal firearms licenses for our applicable locations and perform a pre-transfer background check in connection with all firearms purchases. We perform this background check using either the FBI-managed National Instant Criminal Background Check System (“NICS”) or, if required by state law, state government-managed system that relies on NICS and any additional information collected by the state. These background check systems either confirm that a transfer can be made, deny the transfer or require that the transfer be delayed for further review, and provide us with a transaction number for the proposed transfer. We are required to record the transaction number on an ATF Form 4473 and retain this form in our records for auditing purposes for 20 years for each approved transfer and five years for each denied or delayed transaction. 

The federal categories of prohibited purchasers are the prevailing minimum for all states. States (and, in some cases, local governments) on occasion enact laws that further restrict permissible purchasers of firearms. We are also subject to numerous other federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding firearm sale procedures, record keeping, inspection and reporting, including adhering to minimum age restrictions regarding the purchase or possession of firearms or ammunition, residency requirements, applicable waiting periods, importation regulations and regulations pertaining to the shipment and transportation of firearms. 

Over the past several years, bills have been introduced in the United States Congress that would restrict or prohibit the manufacture, transfer, importation or sale of certain calibers of handgun ammunition, impose a tax and import controls on bullets designed to penetrate bullet-proof vests, impose a special occupational tax and registration requirements on manufacturers of handgun ammunition and increase the tax on handgun ammunition in certain calibers. Recently, Congress has debated certain gun control measures that were supported by the prior administration.

In September 2004, Congress declined to renew the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 (“AWB”), which prohibited the manufacture of certain firearms defined as “assault weapons”; restricted the sale or possession of “assault weapons,” except those that were manufactured prior to the law’s enactment; and placed restrictions on the sale of new high capacity ammunition feeding devices. Various states and local jurisdictions, including Colorado, Maryland and New York, (states in which we operate or plan to operate applicable stores), have adopted their own versions of the AWB or high capacity ammunition feeding device restrictions, some of which restrictions apply to the products we sell in other states. If a statute similar to the AWB were to be enacted or re-enacted at the federal level, it would impact our ability to sell certain products. Additionally, state and local governments have proposed laws and regulations that, if enacted, would place additional restrictions on the manufacture, transfer, sale, purchase, possession and use of firearms, ammunition and shooting-related products. For example, several states, such as Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Washington have enacted laws and regulations that are more restrictive than federal laws and regulations that limit access to and sale of certain firearms. Additionally, Connecticut and New York impose mandatory screening of ammunition purchases; California and the District 

 
  25

 
of Columbia have requirements for microstamping (that is, engraving the handgun’s serial number on each cartridge) of new handguns; and some states prohibit the sale of guns without internal or external locking mechanisms. Other state or local governmental entities may also explore similar legislative or regulatory initiatives that may further restrict the manufacture, sale, purchase, possession or use of firearms, ammunition and shooting-related products. 

The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which became effective in October 2005, prohibits civil liability actions from being brought or continued in any federal or state court against federally licensed manufacturers, distributors, dealers or importers of firearms or ammunition for damages, punitive damages, injunctive or declaratory relief, abatement, restitution, fines, penalties or other relief resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by third parties. The legislation does not preclude traditional product liability actions. 

We are also subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, protection of the environment, human health and safety, advertising, pricing, weights and measures, product safety, and other matters. Some of these laws affect or restrict the manner in which we can sell certain items, such as handguns, smokeless powder, black powder substitutes, ammunition, bows, knives and other products. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the terms of such laws and that we have no liabilities under such laws that we expect could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 Compliance

We are routinely inspected by the ATF and various state agencies to ensure compliance with federal and local regulations with regards to the manufacture, transfer, importation or sale of firearms and related products. While we view such inspections as a starting point, we employ more thorough internal compliance inspections to help ensure we are in compliance with all applicable laws. We dedicate significant resources to ensure compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations, including to in-store training and other training materials such as learning management system training modules, training manuals, and standard operating procedures. Our compliance department conducts random internal audits which modeled after those conducted by ATF inspectors. Our staff at retail locations are required to adhere to compliance direction from training materials. We utilize a database and application program to track acquisitions and dispositions of serialized inventory that are designed to meet all federal standards. Additionally, we use an internet-enabled application to assist in completing the federally required records and background checks for firearms. 

We are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations relating to, among other things, advertising and product restrictions, some of which prohibit or limit the sale, in certain states and locations, of certain items, such as black powder firearms, ammunition, bows, knives, and similar products. Our compliance department administers various restriction codes and other software tools to prevent the sale of such jurisdictionally restricted items.
 Insurance Laws and Regulations
 As a marketer of insurance programs, we are subject to state rules and regulations governing the business of insurance including, without limitation, laws governing the administration, underwriting, marketing, solicitation and/or sale of insurance programs. The insurance carriers that underwrite the programs that we sell are required to file their rates for approval by state regulators. Additionally, certain state laws and regulations govern the form and content of certain disclosures that must be made in connection with the sale, advertising or offer of any insurance program to a consumer. We review all marketing materials we disseminate to the public for compliance with applicable insurance regulations. We are required to maintain certain licenses and approvals in order to market insurance programs. Marketing Laws and Regulations
 The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and each of the states have enacted consumer protection statutes designed to ensure that consumers are protected from unfair and deceptive marketing

practices. We review all of our marketing materials for compliance with applicable FTC regulations and state marketing laws.
 Our e-commerce business is subject to the Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule and related regulations promulgated by the FTC which affect our catalog mail order operations. FTC regulations, in general, govern the solicitation of orders, the information provided to prospective customers, and the timeliness of shipments and refunds. In addition, the FTC has established guidelines for advertising and labeling many of the products we sell.
 In 2003, the FTC amended its Telemarketing Sales Rule to establish a National “Do Not Call” Registry. As of September 2016, the “Do Not Call” Registry included approximately 226 million phone numbers. To comply with the rule, companies are required to match their call lists against the “Do Not Call” Registry prior to conducting outbound telemarketing and remove the names of consumers who have requested they not be called. In addition, the amended Telemarketing Sales Rule requires additional disclosures and sales practices for goods and services sold over the phone. We match our call lists with the “Do Not Call Registry” and implement telemarketing scripts to comply with this regulation.
 On December 29, 2010, federal legislation entitled the “Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act” was enacted (“ROSCA”). The legislation prohibits the acquisition of consumers’ credit or debit card account numbers automatically from our partners when a consumer enrolls in one of our programs immediately after making a purchase through one of our partners’ websites and requires additional disclosure relating to the online marketing of, and billing for, membership programs in the online post-transaction environment. We have put procedures in place to address compliance with ROSCA.
 Effective October 2011, Florida passed legislation similar to ROSCA, but with some additional requirements, and effective January 2012, Oregon passed legislation regulating free trial offers. The Florida law, like ROSCA, requires that an online post-transaction third-party seller must obtain the express informed consent of the consumer to the sale by obtaining from the consumer the full account number of the account to be charged. The Florida law also requires that online post-transaction third-party sellers must send a written notice confirming the transaction to the consumer by first class U.S. mail or by email. The Oregon legislation prohibits a person from causing a consumer to incur a financial obligation as a result of accepting a free offer unless the person obtains the consumer’s billing information directly from the consumer. We have put procedures in place to address compliance with these laws.
 In addition to the discussion of the Dodd-Frank Act above in connection with our automotive activities, see “— Motor Vehicle Laws and Regulations,” we are also subject to Dodd-Frank Act in connection with our various marketing efforts.
 Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
 Our operations involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling and/or disposal of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires and propane. Consequently, our business is subject to a complex variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate the environment and public health and safety.
 Most of our retail locations utilize aboveground storage tanks, and to a lesser extent underground storage tanks, primarily for petroleum-based products. Storage tanks are subject to periodic testing, containment, upgrading and removal requirements under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its state law counterparts. Clean-up or other remedial action may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from storage tanks or other sources. In addition, water quality protection programs under the federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act), the Safe Drinking Water Act and comparable state and local programs govern certain discharges from some of our operations. Similarly, air emissions from our operations, such as RV painting, are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and related state and local laws. Certain health and safety standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor and related state agencies also apply.

 Although we incur costs to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of our business, we do not presently anticipate that such costs will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We do not have any material known environmental commitments or contingencies.
 Insurance
 We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, product liability, general liability, business interruption, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance, environmental, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Where we have retained risk through self-insurance or similar arrangements, we utilize third-party actuarial firms to assist management in assessing the financial impact of risk retention. Our results could be adversely affected by claims and other expenses related to such plans and policies if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 9,877 full-time and 699 part-time or seasonal employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are good. Seasonality
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in revenues and net income as a result of annual seasonality in our business. Because RVs are used primarily by vacationers and campers, demand for services, protection plans, products and resources generally declines during the winter season, while sales and profits are generally highest during the spring and summer months. Conversely, we expect demand for non-RV-related outdoor and active sports products to generally decline during the first and second fiscal quarters and we expect sales and profits to generally be higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. In addition, unusually severe weather conditions in some geographic areas may impact demand. On average over the last three years ended December 31, 2017, we generated 30.4% and 28.9% of our annual revenues in the second and third fiscal quarters, respectively, which include the spring and summer months. Additionally, the average quarterly revenue percentage generated over the last three years ended December 31, 2017 from our Consumer Services and Plans segment was 25.1%, 24.5%, 23.9% and 26.5% for the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, and the average quarterly revenue percentage generated over the last three years ended December 31, 2017 from our Retail segment was 21.2%, 30.4%, 28.9% and 19.5% for the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. We have historically incurred additional expenses in the second and third fiscal quarters due to higher purchase volumes, increased staffing in our retail locations and program costs.
