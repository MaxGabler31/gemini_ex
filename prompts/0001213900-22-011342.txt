ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------




In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners Co.



Introduction



We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 15, 2020. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to identifying target businesses and consummating our initial business combination with a target business. Our initial business combination and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, assist in the growth of a technology business in the United States. Our focus will be on the artificial intelligence, cloud services and automotive technology sectors. However, we are not limited to the technology industry, or the named sectors, and we may pursue a business combination opportunity in any business or industry we choose and we may pursue a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States.



Our Chairman, Dr. Eric R. Ball, and special advisor, Mr. Brent Callinicos, both have long track records of senior management leadership in high growth technology companies. Within the technology industry, our initial focus will be on the artificial intelligence, cloud services and automotive technology sectors. Our management team possesses a strong understanding of the SPAC structure and market. Our Chief Executive Officer, Stephen N. Cannon, has served as a member of management for seven SPACs that have completed initial public offerings, four of which have consummated a business combination.



Dr. Eric R. Ball, our Chairman, is the founder and General Partner of Impact Venture Capital, or Impact VC. Impact VC is a Silicon Valley based venture firm investing in early-stage applied artificial intelligence startup companies since 2016. Previously Mr. Ball held several senior level management positions in high growth technology companies. He was the Chief Financial Officer for C3.AI from 2015 to 2016. Prior to that Dr. Ball spent over a decade with Oracle Corp, including acting as Senior Vice President & Treasurer, and previously was a senior financial professional for Flextronics International, Cisco Systems, Avery Dennison, and AT&T. Dr. Ball has served as advisor and board member of several technology companies, including currently serving as chairman of the audit committee for the board of Glu Mobile Inc. Dr. Ball is also the co-author of the book “Unlocking the Ivory Tower”.



Mr. Brent Callinicos is our special advisor. Mr. Callinicos is currently an angel investor, active in investing in early-stage technology companies. Mr. Callinicos was formerly the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Virgin Hyperloop One. Prior to that, Mr. Callinicos was the Chief Financial Officer of Uber Technologies Inc. Prior to that, Mr. Callinicos was the Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Accountant of Google Inc., now known as Alphabet Inc. Prior to that, Mr. Callinicos held several senior management roles at Microsoft, including as Treasurer, Vice President of Worldwide Licensing and Pricing, and CFO of the Platforms and Services Division. Mr. Callinicos has served as an advisor to several technology companies and currently sits on several boards.



Stephen N. Cannon, our Chief Executive Officer, has served as a member of management for seven SPACs that have completed initial public offerings, four of which have consummated a business combination. The fifth SPAC, Ackrell SPAC Partners I Co., completed its IPO in December 2020 and announced on December 23, 2021 that it had entered into a definitive business combination agreement with Blackstone Products, a consumer brand of outdoor cooking products. The sixth SPAC, Archimedes SPAC Partners Co. Completed its IPO in March 2021 and announced on November 16, 2021 that it had entered into a business combination agreement with SoundHound Inc., a company that focuses on Voice AI technology. The seventh SPAC, Global SPAC Partners Co. Completed its IPO in April 2021 and announced on December 22, 2021 that it had entered into a business combination agreement with Gorilla Technology Group Inc., a company that focuses on Edge analytics AI solutions.



Daniel L. Sheehan, our Chief Operating Officer, and Long Long, our Chief Financial Officer, are also currently serving as members of the board and management, respectively, for Ackrell SPAC Partners I Co. In addition, Long Long is also serving as Chief Financial Officer for Global SPAC Partners Co.

Bryant B. Edwards, a director of ours, served as Chief Operating Officer and director for Twelve Seas Investment Co., a SPAC which successful closed its business combination in December 2019.



While we may pursue a business combination target in any business, industry or geographical location, we intend to focus our search for businesses in the technology industry, and our focus will be on the artificial intelligence, cloud services and automotive technology sectors.



Our management team consists of seasoned professionals who have experience spanning the technology industry, including the sectors within the technology industry that we intend to focus on initially, mergers and acquisitions, corporate finance, corporate governance and compliance, legal and regulatory matters and investment management. We believe that our officers’ and directors’ industry expertise, transaction experience and relationships may provide us with a substantial number of attractive potential business combination targets.



The past performance of our management team or of their affiliates is not a guarantee either (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team’s or their affiliates’ performance as indicative of our future performance.



Business Strategy



We believe that there are a range of target businesses that could benefit from our industry knowledge, relationships, capital and public vehicle. Our strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a target operating in the technology industry. Our focus will be on the artificial intelligence, cloud services and automotive technology sectors. While we intend to initially focus on potential opportunities in the United States, the technology industry is global and we may pursue opportunities internationally.



We intend to leverage our team’s collective experience in the technology industry and capital markets to successfully complete a business combination, and then continue to support our target business with our industry relationships, insights and regulatory knowledge, financial expertise and capital resources.



Competitive Strengths



We believe we are well positioned to find and attract an exciting technology business, and to help them as a newly public company grow and thrive, offering a partnership that extends far beyond our capital. Our management team’s deep operational experience, product experience, extensive networks, and track records as investors, advisors, and board members make us an attractive partner.



We are dedicated to finding bold founders, operators, and inventors who are committed to building a leading business and would benefit from access to the public markets as well as working with our team. We have a proven track record of success in the technology industry as senior executives, investors and board members and are confident that we can partner with other founders, shareholder and management to help support building a category-defining business. We believe we possess the following tools to drive value creation at a company:



Experience recognizing key technology trends: Our team has demonstrated a long history of managing and growing businesses at the epicenter of major technology trends. More recently, certain team members have been active in identifying and investing, at earlier stages, in companies focused on the next big trend, such as artificial intelligence, cloud services and automotive technology. For the technology industry especially, history has shown that small early stage companies, of even just five years ago, are often among the most exciting group of companies seeking a public listing in the near future. We believe our recent activity in identifying investment opportunities in early stage companies in key technology trends, is an advantage when combined with our track record of managing and growing successful public technology companies, and unique in our ability to identify and successful secure an initial business combination.



Experience identifying strong management teams: With key members of our team having had significant senior executive roles at key technology companies, we believe we have an ability to identify the characteristics of successful business leaders, and effective in engaging with these management teams. In addition, key members of our team have more recently been investing in many founder-led businesses.




2







History of operating experience: The members of our team are seasoned operators having held executive level roles in various companies. We have experience in developing and executing strategy, building and retaining teams, and executing business combinations among other activities.



Deep network and connections to company founders: Our team has numerous existing connections to company founders and business leaders across sectors within the technology industry. We have invested in many companies, served on many boards and have worked with many influential founders and senior management teams within the technology industry, and specifically the sectors we intend to initially focus on. We believe our network and our connections will assist in the successful selection of our initial business combination and subsequent guidance of the company.



Significant Prior SPAC Experience: Our management team possesses a strong understanding of the SPAC structure and market. Our CEO, Stephen N. Cannon, has served as a member of management for seven SPACs that have completed initial public offerings, four of which have consummated business combinations. The stock price performance of Mr. Cannon’s prior SPACs has not always been positive for investors. For example, the common shares of the four SPACs that previously consummated business combinations are currently trading below $10.00 per share. Further, Mr. Cannon’s other SPAC never consummated its IPO due to market conditions.



Investment Criteria



We are leveraging the extensive network and experience of our management team in identifying a suitable target within the technology industry and structuring a business combination that is attractive to both the target and our public stockholders. We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see fit to do so:



Clear and Sustainable Competitive Advantages: We intend to target businesses that differentiate themselves from their peers in ways that are difficult to replicate and have clear competitive advantages. Members of our team have accomplished track records of founding, operating, and investing in the technology industry and intend to focus on prospective businesses that engage with technology to serve customers in novel and transformational manner. We believe our team’s expertise and understanding of innovative businesses will be paramount in identifying and assessing initial business combination candidates.



High Growth Potential: We intend to seek businesses that are well positioned to grow in their respective markets and which have clear plans on how to leverage additional capital to accelerate growth. We expect to target businesses that have had, or expect to have, strong cash flow generation. We believe that our team’s collective experiences engaging with innovative businesses positions us well to identify, nurture, and expand high potential businesses.



Experienced Management Teams: We intend to seek to target businesses that have strong, experienced and dynamic management teams, many of whom will be founders of the businesses, but whom we believe may benefit from our financial, managerial and investment expertise as well as our extensive industry networks and insights. We believe that identifying such management teams is particularly important given our target industry.



Attractive Valuations: We intend to only evaluate a business that, based on our due diligence and industry experience, represents an attractive valuation relative to publicly listed companies with similar characteristics or in similar industry segments. We intend to seek businesses in which we believe we can add operational value through mentorship of management, knowledge of operating challenges, experience with industry dynamics, expertise in navigating public markets, and strategic relationships with investors, among others.



Will Benefit from Being a Public Company: We intend to pursue a business that will benefit from being a public company, including potentially having broader access to capital and a public currency for acquisitions.



These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.

Effecting a Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of private units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to our management team’s pre-existing fiduciary obligations and the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding the taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business.



The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.



Fair Market Value of Target Business



Nasdaq listing rules require that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding the taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.



We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.




4







The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.



We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.



Lack of Business Diversification



Although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses and we may seek to effect a business combination with more than one target business, we expect to complete our business combination with a single business. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.



Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management



Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination



In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their subunits, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their subunits to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its subunits rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its subunits. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their subunits to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we decide to allow our stockholders to sell their subunits to us in a tender offer, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.



We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets either immediately prior to or upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait 18 months in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.



Our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any founder shares or subunits in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any founder shares of subunits in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.



None of our officers, directors, sponsor, initial stockholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units, subunits or warrants in this offering or from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, sponsor, initial stockholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of units, subunits or warrants if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.



Conversion Rights



At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their subunits, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their subunits to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.



Our sponsor, initial stockholders and our officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any founder shares or subunits owned by them, directly or indirectly. Additionally, the holders of the representative shares will not have conversion rights with respect to the representative shares.




6







Furthermore, public stockholders who redeem or tender their subunits for their pro rata share of the trust account will continue to have the right to exercise any warrants held by them which are not included in a subunit, but will automatically forfeit the warrants included in the redeemed subunits. This is different than other similarly structured blank check companies where a redeeming or tendering stockholder is able to keep any warrants he may still hold, whether included in a unit or held separately. Common stock alone will not be entitled to receive the redemption amount. Accordingly, investors may have a disincentive to exercise the redemption rights because they will automatically forfeit, without the receipt of any additional consideration, the portion of the warrant included in the subunit.



We may require public holders of subunits, whether they are a record holder or hold their subunits in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their subunits to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the subunits or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver subunits is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.



Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “In connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require stockholders who wish to convert their subunits in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.



Any request to convert such subunits once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public subunit delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their subunits for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. In such case, we will promptly return any subunits delivered by public holders.



Liquidation if No Business Combination



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 18 months to complete an initial business combination from the closing of this offering. If we have not completed an initial business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public subunits, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public subunits, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law. Public stockholders will also forfeit the one-quarter of a warrant included in the subunits being redeemed. As promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, we will dissolve and liquidate, subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.




7







Our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their subunits to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public subunits if we do not complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of the Company’s initial offering unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their subunits upon such approval at a per-subunit price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public subunits. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, initial stockholders, executive officers, directors or any other person.



Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public subunits in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. It is our intention to redeem our public subunit as soon as reasonably possible following our 18th month after the initial public offering, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.



Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public subunits in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution.



Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.




We are required to seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after this offering) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, UHY LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of the offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that other vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per subunit by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement our sponsor entered into specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-subunit distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors.

We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after the 18th month and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the founder shares and private subunits have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution from the trust account with respect to such shares and subunits. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has contractually agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and has contractually agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses.



If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-subunit redemption price would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.



Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period, if the stockholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective subunits upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to consummating an initial business combination. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.



If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per subunit.



If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after 18 months from the closing of this offering, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.



Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions that apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their subunits to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public subunits if we do not complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their public subunits in connection with any such vote. This conversion right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any founder shares, private subunits, private shares and any public subunits they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

● | we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their subunits, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their subunits to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;

● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated within 18 months from the closing of this offering, then we will redeem all of the outstanding public subunits and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the common stock sold in this offering on an initial business combination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe that there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.



The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:




● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert or repurchase subunits held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------




Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.



If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.



Employees



We have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
