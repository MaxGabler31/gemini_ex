Operations
 
General
 
Worksport was founded in 2011 to take advantage of the limited innovation provided by existing tonneau cover manufacturers. Tonneau covers have remained much the same in price and design since 2005 with one main company controlling a majority of the tonneau cover market. This dynamic market segment is in need of a new innovative manufacturer of high quality, functional, and aggressively priced tonneau covers. Worksport has developed multiple products for all of the most prominent pick-up trucks available in North America. Details of each product can be found at www.Worksportcovers.com. Worksport sells its products through wholesalers in Canada and the U.S. and through third-party online retailers. 
 
Nature of Products and Services
 
Worksport designs, patents, produces, and distributes tonneau covers (truck bed covers) for light duty trucks sold in North, South, and Central America. Light trucks commonly do not come with truck bed covers from the factory, and the ones offered at the dealership are often expensive and limited in features. Worksport designs innovative and affordable truck bed covers (tonneau covers) sold through the SEM (Specialty equipment market or “Aftermarket”) through a evolving chain of dealers and distributors in North America. The popularity of our product is driven by the popularity of light truck sales as they become more affordable and fuel efficient, meeting the lifestyles of today’s common consumer. 
 
Early 2017 Truck Market: 
 
Ram sold more pickup trucks in the United States during April 2017 than Chevrolet. Truck sales numbers are in. This is the second month this calendar year that Ram full-size truck lineup is outselling Chevrolet. Chevy Silverado is still in second place with Year-To-Date number, but the sales are declining when compared to same time periods last year.
 
Ford F-Series is still number one in United States sales. Even if you combine the Silverado and Sierra sales together, these are still lower than the F-Series numbers. Although, Ford sales in April were about even when compared to last year (-0.2%).
 
Toyota Tundra is also sliding down in sales, but it has a firm grasp on the fifth place. The Nissan Titan is gaining sales with the availability of the half-ton and XD variants, but raw numbers are still relatively low. Nissan sold 4,033 Titans in April.

Nissan Titan is still struggling to get sales momentum.

Background
 
For many years, consumers have had very limited options available to them from tonneau cover manufacturers. The leading manufacturers in the North American market have had very few new model developments. The tonneau cover market can be divided into four main styles of covers:
1. Soft Folding & Roll-up covers (Vinyl covers) 
 2. Hard Folding & Standing Covers (Aluminum and FRP)
 3. Solid one-piece caps and lids (Plastic & Fiberglass)
 4. Retractable Covers (Plastic & Aluminum)
 
We believe the consumer favors models that are the least cumbersome, most functional, and lowest initial cost. Solid one piece covers and retractable covers are the least desirable because of their limited functionality and overall cost. Therefore, the most popular covers in today’s market are soft and hard folding/rolling tonneau covers.

Market Analysis and Distribution
 
The Specialty Equipment (aftermarket) consists of three major types of customers which include; master warehouse distributor, dealer / wholesaler, and end retail consumer. Master warehouse distributors will stock and distribute product to their customers, which are usually local dealers and wholesalers. Dealers and wholesalers are local stores which sell product to some businesses and retail consumers in their area and online. Dealers will purchase most of their product from their local distributor who will deliver to them regularly. Retail end consumers are simply the end user of your product. Worksport currently sells its product line through distributors and dealer networks. 
 
The OEM market consists of vehicle manufactures with corporate offices and distribution points globally. Specifically, within North America the OEM market would consist of corporate offices and warehouses in Canada, USA, and Mexico. Target OEM’s for Worksport would be:
 
Toyota Motor Co.
 Ford Motor Co.
 Nissan Motor Co. 
 General Motors
FCA Automotive (RAM Trucks) 
Presently each vehicle manufacturer above purchases their OEM brand tonneau covers (tonneau cover installed at the factory) from an independent accessory manufacturer, such as Worksport. No vehicle manufacturer designs and manufacturers their own tonneau covers. 
 
Worksport’s target market includes master warehouse distributors and dealers. 
 
In the Canadian market, Worksport does the majority of its business with warehouse distributors and select dealer customers. In the US market, Worksport’s customer base is mostly dealers and wholesalers. 
 
Worksport USA is a supplying member of one of the largest aftermarket buying groups in the USA. American Aftermarket Group (AAG), owned by Line-X coatings, consists of over 700 car and truck accessory stores. Being a supplying member of AAG gives Worksport access to most of the large truck accessory dealers, wholesalers, and online stores in the USA. Our products are sold to AAG members by the sales staff at AAG and all customer service and maintenance is done through phone calls, emails, and infrequent visits. 
 
Worksport Canada sells to only select dealers in Ontario as well as the largest warehouse distributor in eastern Canada. Robert Thibert in Chteauguay, QC has over 600,000 square feet of warehouse space in three provinces in Canada. Robert Thibert is responsible for stocking and selling our product to their customer base in Canada. Worksport dealer sales in Ontario are to only select dealers who assist with product feedback. 
 
Regular contact is made with our customer base about new product, promotions, updates, and general sales by phone, email, and in person, when possible. 
 
A partial list of our customers includes:
 
Enterprise Robert Thibert (Quebec, Canada)
 Trailer Parts Etc. (Florida, USA)

As of May 2018, Worksport, has decided to temporarily discontinue the Smart Roll as offered to re-engineer a more innovative product, to be launched to OEM and SEM clients in late 2018 or early 2019. 
 
Truck Hero Group is the holding company for Extang Corporation, TruXedo, Inc., BedRug, Inc, UnderCover Inc., Advantage Truck Accessories Inc, Retrax Inc, and BAK Industries, NFAB, RealTruck.Com, Auto Customs, and ARE Truck Caps, and more. They account for the majority of the competing brands in North America.
 
The area of biggest growth in the tonneau cover market is in the area of aggressively priced hard folding tonneau covers. Currently, the market distribution is shared by three primary participants, with LKQ/Keystone considered the market leader.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution Strategy
 
Worksport’s sales strategy is constantly changing and dynamic. Sales are made through warehouse distributors, as they typically handle product sales and promotion through their in-house sales department. To fully saturate the market a business must entice the retail consumer to purchase its product by way of a strong internet presence which will consist of YouTube videos and commercials, an interactive website, search engine optimization, social media, etc. The next step is to have strong working relationships and reputations among dealers and wholesalers who purchase Worksport’s product, either directly or through distributors.
 
Worksport hopes to become the leader in the tonneau cover market through innovation. Our main objective is to design and engineer our products to better suit todays new, dynamic, and innovative models of light trucks. 
 
Worksport hopes to become a significant player in our market segment by always maintaining a strong emphasis on customer service, innovation, quality, and a robust global branding.
 
Worksport’s target market is North, Central, and South America with future plans to expand globally to other market opportunities. Worksport intends to earn revenues from both the automotive specialty equipment market as well as OEM production for vehicle manufactures, globally.

Worksport also plans to gain market share and core value by internally engineering our products to best suit the evolving needs of the consumer as well as a strong intellectual property portfolio (1 Granted Patent, 3 patent applications in Canada and USA – as of 2018). 
 
The Company’s current product lines are as follows:
 
1. Worksport Tri Fold (introduced in 2011)
 
The Tri Fold by Worksport is our very first innovation and our cornerstone product. The Tri Fold by Worksport is a high strength aviation grade alloy frame, joined with industry leading metal hybrid nylon reinforced components and wrapped in a tri-ply vinyl coated and UV protected industrial tarp that is shrink, fade, and tear resistant. The Tri Fold by Worksport is unmatched in value by using industry exclusive patented rubber coated all metal hooks and latches. The Tri Fold by Worksport can be installed without any mechanical experience and without tools, by anyone in less than 10 minutes. The Tri Fold by Worksport is covered by an unmatched warranty, paired with our internal commitment to producing only the finest and toughest gear for Worksport customers.
 
The Worksport Tri Fold is our staple soft folding tonneau cover. The Tri Fold is made with features such as stainless-steel hardware, double coated vinyl tarp, and all aluminum and plastic coated front clamps. The Tri Fold is made available to our customer base at an average cost savings of 5% over competing products.
 
2. Worksport Smart Fold (introduced in 2012)
 
The Smart Fold by Worksport is first of its kind, in our market. The Smart Fold by Worksport is based on the robust frame and tarp shared with the Tri Fold and Quattro product offerings but is the soft folding tonneau cover to be operable without reaching into the bed of your truck and allows single side operation; this means it is the easiest soft folding cover in the market to open and close. The Smart Fold by Worksport is opened by simply pulling our rear release cable and can be slammed shut, with the tailgate opened or closed. Work or play more and worry less, with the Smart Fold by Worksport as an innovative and affordable solution to keep your bed clean, dry, and protected while being easily accessible and securable. 
 
The Worksport Smart Fold is our second product to market and offers our patented rear Smart Latch system. The Smart Fold is the first innovation in the rear latching system offered on soft folding tonneau covers. The Smart Fold cover comes with all of the same features as the Tri Fold but with a new rear latch system that allows the cover to be opened by simply pulling a release cable which is a new innovation in the soft tri fold segment of our market. In 2018 Worksport has imitated Smart-Fold improvements that will result in a better product and follow on patent applications in USA and Canada. 
 
3. Worksport Quattro (Introduced 2015)
 
The Quattro by Worksport defines Worksport’s thirst to develop innovative and exclusive product for the evolved light-truck of today. Finally, a tonneau cover that compliments the innovation brought by light truck manufactures. The Quattro by Worksport is based on the robust frame and tarp shared with the Tri Fold and Smart Fold product offerings but does so much more. The Quattro by Worksport is exclusively the only soft folding tonneau cover to have four panels and three hinges, allowing access to over 75% of your trucks bed. The Quattro by Worksport can be rotated towards the cab of the truck to then allow 100% full bed access, from tailgate to bulkhead. The Quattro by Worksport is the only soft folding cover in the world to allow true, 100%, full bed access without any bars or panels in the truck bed, while also never obstructing the trucks factory cab-mounted third brake light, like leading brands do. The Quattro by Worksport uses NO plastic connection point and is attached to the trucks bed with only the strongest all-metal epoxy coated hardware. Weather you use your truck for Work or for Sport, the Quattro cover is the most elite and complimentary aggressively priced truck bed cover solution for today’s light-trucks.

The Worksport Quad-Fold will be the first vinyl wrapped tonneau cover to fold in four sections. This cover will also allow its users full bed access by being foldable upwards towards the rear window of the truck. We chose to make the world’s first quad folding cover so this cover is more compact when standing parallel to the back window of a truck, thus eliminating wind resistance and rear window obstruction.
 
4. Worksport Smart Roll (Introduced 2015)
 
The Worksport Roll-Up cover takes from a long history of roll up covers in our market place. Although roll-up style covers have been in the market since the early 90’s, the Worksport Roll-Up will offer a sleek, low-profile design, superior side seals, and rear smart latches that will allow its user to open this cover by simply pulling on the rear release loop. As of May 2018, Worksport, has decided to temporarily discontinue the Smart Roll as offered to re-engineer a more innovative product, to be launched to OEM and SEM clients in late 2018 or early 2019. 
5. Worksport Forte 
 
The Forte by Worksport mends the gap between economically priced soft folding covers and the hard-folding covers in our market, today. The Forte by Worksport is completely constructed from high-strength aviation grade aluminum alloy with a corrugated aluminum alloy core. The Forte is both incredibly strong and light weight. With its matte black durable powder coating, the Forte looks just as good as its built. The Forte by Worksport is easy to install, easy to operate, and made using the highest-grade metal and plastic components, built as tough as today’s trucks. The Forte by Worksport is covered by an unmatched warranty, paired with our internal commitment to producing only the finest and toughest gear for Worksport customers. 
 
Taking valuable information learned from the launch of the first generation Worksport Forte. The all-new redesigned Worksport Forte “GEN2” has been engineered to be easy to install and operate while being offered at a MAP price that fills a much-needed void between soft and hard tonneau covers. 
 
The GEN2 Forte cover will now be built using 6MM thick aluminum panels with a robust honeycomb core, coated in a durable matte-black scratch resistant powder coating. The GEN2 Forte cover will be 30% lighter and cost 25-30% less to manufacture. With robust packaging, the lighter weight GEN2 Forte will also save time and money with up to 10% more load quantity in a standard 40’ HC container, therefore maximizing value and product profitability. Notably, the GEN2 Forte will not come with the same cargo-division and tool bags as its predecessor, as cargo division and storage solutions are being closely reviewed and implemented with the Worksport Alpha series of products. 
 
The GEN2 Forte will be manufactured as a Worksport branded product as well as a cornerstone product for private label manufacturing in North, Central, and South American markets. 
 
In addition, we are currently re-engineering the Worksport Smart Fold latch system based on consumer feedback. As a consequence, the next generation Smart Fold covers will be far easier to install and will be available for both domestic and imported light trucks.
 
Worksport also launched its new Alpha series of tonneau covers at SEMA 2015. The Alpha products are set to be released late 2018 or early 2019, upon successful capital raise for new research and development. The Alpha and Alpha Helios model covers are anticipated to be very successful in the automotive aftermarket.
