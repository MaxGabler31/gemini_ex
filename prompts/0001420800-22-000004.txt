Item 1. Business
General
Colfax Corporation (the “Company”, “Colfax”, “we” or “us”) is a leading diversified technology company that provides fabrication technology and medical device products and services to customers around the world, principally under the ESAB and DJO brands. The Company has been built through a series of acquisitions, as well as organic growth, since its founding in 1995. We seek to build an enduring premier global enterprise by applying the Colfax Business System (“CBS”) to continuously improve our Company and pursue growth in revenues and improvements in profit and cash flow.
On March 4, 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate its fabrication technology and specialty medical technology businesses into two differentiated, independent, and publicly traded companies. The current Colfax entity will retain the specialty medical technology business under a new name, Enovis Corporation. The fabrication technology business will operate independently under the existing ESAB brand name. The separation is intended to be structured in a tax-free manner and is targeted to be completed near the end of the first quarter of 2022. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the fabrication technology businesses are included in continuing operations of the Company in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
On January 13, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Charter International plc (“Charter”), which transformed Colfax from its historical roots as a fluid handling business into a diversified industrial enterprise with a broad global footprint. This acquisition provided a growth platform in the fragmented fabrication technology sector, while broadening the scope of our fluid handling platform to include air and gas handling products. Following the Charter acquisition, we strengthened and expanded the fluid handling and air & gas handling operations through acquisitions and the application of CBS before divesting the platforms in December 2017 and September 2019, respectively. 
On February 22, 2019, we completed the acquisition of DJO Global, Inc. (“DJO”) for a net purchase price of $3.15 billion. DJO is a global developer, manufacturer and distributor of high-quality medical devices with a broad range of products used for orthopedic bracing, reconstructive implants, rehabilitation, pain management and physical therapy. DJO products address the continuum of patient care from injury prevention to rehabilitation from injury or degenerative disease, enabling people to regain or maintain their natural motion. The DJO acquisition is part of our strategic evolution creating a new growth platform in the high-margin orthopedic solutions market.
On September 30, 2019, we completed the divestiture of our Air and Gas Handling business for an aggregate purchase price of $1.8 billion, including $1.67 billion of cash paid at closing and the assumption of certain liabilities and minority interests. We used the cash proceeds, net of transaction expenses and estimated taxes, to pay down approximately $1.6 billion of debt that was incurred through the DJO acquisition.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed five acquisitions and three investments, all within our Medical Technology segment. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed five acquisitions and three investments within our Medical Technology segment, and one acquisition within our Fabrication Technology segment. See Note 5, “Acquisitions”, for further information.
Our business management system, CBS, is integral to our operations. CBS consists of a comprehensive set of tools and repeatable, teachable processes that are designed to drive continuous improvement and create superior value for our customers, shareholders and associates. Rooted in our core values, it is our culture. We believe that our management team’s access to, and experience in, the application of the CBS methodology is one of our primary competitive strengths.
Each year, Colfax associates in every business develop strategic and operating plans which are based on the Voice of the Customer. In these plans, we are clear about our market realities, our threats, our risks, our opportunities and, most importantly, our vision. Our belief is that when we use the tools of CBS to drive the implementation of these plans, we are able to uniquely provide customers with the world-class quality, delivery, cost and innovation they require. We believe that performance ultimately helps our customers and Colfax sustainably grow and succeed. 
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was first reported in China. On March 11, 2020, due to worldwide spread of the virus, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis, and the resulting impact on governments, businesses and individuals and actions taken by them in response to the situation have resulted in widespread economic disruptions, significantly affecting broader economies, financial markets, and overall demand for the Company’s products. While these impacts lessened in the first half of 2021 due to broadening access to COVID-19 vaccines and gradual relaxing of some government-mandated restrictions, the surge of COVID-19 virus variants in the second half of 2021 has led to the reinstatement of restrictions in certain jurisdictions, disrupting the supply chains and slowing economic recovery. The COVID-19 outbreak has caused increased uncertainty in estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements as the extent and period of recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak and related economic disruption can be difficult to forecast. Furthermore, the historical seasonality trends have been disrupted by the commercial impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and, more recently, supply chain disruptions.
Reportable Segments
We report our operations through the Fabrication Technology and Medical Technology segments.
Fabrication Technology 
We formulate, develop, manufacture and supply consumable products and equipment for use in cutting, joining and automated welding, as well as gas control equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2021, welding consumables represented approximately 69% of our Fabrication Technology segment’s total Net sales. Our fabrication technology products are marketed under several brand names, most notably ESAB, which we believe is well known in the international welding industry. ESAB’s comprehensive range of welding consumables includes electrodes, cored and solid wires and fluxes using a wide range of specialty and other materials, and cutting consumables including electrodes, nozzles, shields and tips. ESAB’s fabrication technology equipment ranges from portable welding machines to large customized automated cutting and welding systems. ESAB also offers a range of digital software and solutions to help its customers increase their productivity, remotely monitor their welding operations and digitize their documentation. Products are sold into a wide range of global end markets, including general industry, construction, infrastructure, transportation, energy, renewable energy, and medical & life sciences. Our sales channels include both independent distributors and direct salespeople who, depending on geography and end market, sell our products to our end users.
Medical Technology 
We develop, manufacture and distribute high-quality medical devices and services across the continuum of patient care from injury prevention to joint replacement to rehabilitation after surgery, injury or from degenerative disease, enabling people to regain or maintain their natural motion. We serve the following two markets where we maintain leading positions in most of their product categories: Prevention & Recovery and Reconstructive. Our products are used by orthopedic specialists, surgeons, primary care physicians, pain management specialists, physical therapists, podiatrists, chiropractors, athletic trainers and other healthcare professionals to treat patients with musculoskeletal conditions resulting from degenerative diseases, deformities, traumatic events and sports-related injuries. In addition, many of our non-surgical medical devices and related accessories are used by athletes and patients for injury prevention and at-home physical therapy treatment. Our product lines include rigid and soft orthopedic bracing, hot and cold therapy, bone growth stimulators, vascular therapy systems and compression garments, therapeutic shoes and inserts, electrical stimulators used for pain management and physical therapy products. Our surgical implant business offers a comprehensive suite of reconstructive joint products for the hip, knee, shoulder, elbow, foot, ankle, 
and finger. We reach a diverse customer base through multiple distribution channels, including both independent distributors and direct salespeople, and provide a wide range of medical devices and related products to orthopedic specialists and other healthcare professionals operating in a variety of patient treatment settings and to retail consumers.
The following discussions of Industry and Competition, International Operations, Research and Development, Intellectual Property, Raw Materials, Seasonality, Working Capital, Regulatory Environment, Human Capital Management, and Company Information and Access to SEC Reports include information that is common to both of our reportable segments, unless indicated otherwise.
Industry and Competition
Our Fabrication Technology segment products and services are marketed worldwide and the markets we serve are fragmented and competitive. Because we compete in selected niches of these markets and due to the diversity of our products and services, no single company competes directly with us across all our markets. We encounter a wide variety of competitors that differ by product line, including well-established regional competitors, competitors with greater specialization in particular markets, as well as larger competitors. The markets that our Fabrication Technology segment competes in are also served by Lincoln Electric and the welding business within Illinois Tool Works, Inc. Our customer base is broadly diversified across many sectors of the economy, and we believe customers place a premium on quality, reliability, availability, innovation, and application engineering support. We believe the principal elements of competition in our served markets are the ability to improve customer productivity and solve their technical challenges, reliably and timely supply high-quality products that represent a good value, and offer outstanding aftermarket support including application expertise and engineering capabilities. Our management believes that we are a leading competitor in each of our markets with leading and well-recognized brands. 
Our Medical Technology segment generates approximately 72% of its revenues in the United States and the majority of the remaining balance in Europe. The markets in which our Medical Technology segment competes are highly competitive and fragmented. We believe the principal elements of competition are innovation to create better patient outcomes, product quality, product reliability, brand names, and price. We compete with large, diversified corporations and companies which are part of corporate groups that have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, as well as numerous smaller niche companies. The markets in which our Medical Technology segment competes are also served by Stryker and DePuy Synthes, the medical device business within Johnson & Johnson. Given our history of product development and the experience of our management team, we are capable of effectively competing in our markets. The comprehensive range of products we offer enables us to reach a diverse customer base through multiple distribution channels with numerous opportunities to increase our growth across our markets. Our management believes that we are a leading competitor in each of our markets with leading and well-recognized brands.
International Operations
Our Fabrication Technology segment products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a global workforce, provides stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams that may offset economic trends in individual economies, and offers an opportunity to access new markets for products. In addition, we believe that our exposure to developing economies will provide additional opportunities for growth in the future. 
Our Medical Technology segment sells its products internationally through a network of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors. In Europe, we use sales forces of direct and independent salespersons and a network of independent distributors who call on healthcare professionals, as well as consumer retail stores and pharmacies, to sell our products. We intend to continue to expand our direct and indirect distribution capabilities in attractive foreign markets.
Our principal markets for our Fabrication Technology segment outside the U.S. are Europe, Asia, South America, and the Middle East, while our principal market for our Medical Technology segment outside the U.S. is Europe. For our company as a whole for the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 60% of our Net sales were shipped to locations outside of the U.S., with approximately 32% shipped to locations outside North America and Europe.
Our international operations subject us to certain risks. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations”. The majority of our sales are derived from international operations. We are subject to specific risks associated with international operations.
Research and Development
Our research and development activities vary by operating segment, focusing on innovation; developing new products, software and services, as well as the enhancement of existing products with the latest technology and updated designs; creating new applications for existing products; lowering the cost of manufacturing our existing products; and redesigning existing product lines to increase efficiency, improve durability, enhance performance and usability.
Additionally, in our Medical Technology segment, we receive new product and invention ideas from orthopedic surgeons and other healthcare professionals. We seek to obtain rights to ideas we consider promising from a clinical and commercial perspective through entering into either assignment or licensing agreements. We maintain contractual relationships with orthopedic surgeons who assist us in developing our products and may also provide consulting services in connection with our products.
Research and development expense was $88.8 million, $68.6 million and $61.8 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts do not include development and application engineering costs incurred in conjunction with fulfilling customer orders and executing customer projects, nor do they include costs related to securing third party product rights. We expect to continue making significant expenditures for research and development to maintain and improve our competitive positions.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property both in the U.S. and around the world for both our Fabrication Technology and Medical Technology segments. Although we highlight recent additions to our patent portfolio as part of our marketing efforts, we do not consider any one patent or trademark or any group thereof essential to our business as a whole or to any of our business operations. We also rely on proprietary product knowledge and manufacturing processes in our operations. We do not rely solely on our patents and other intellectual property rights to maintain our competitive position. We believe that the development and marketing of new products and improvement of existing ones is, and will continue to be, more important to our competitive position than relying solely on existing products and intellectual property.
Raw Materials
We obtain raw materials, component parts and supplies from a variety of global sources, generally each from more than one supplier. Our principal raw materials and components for our Fabrication Technology segment are steel, iron, copper and aluminum. Our principal raw materials and components for our Medical Technologies segment are ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer form for our bracing and vascular products and cobalt-chromium alloy, stainless steel alloys, titanium alloy and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene for our surgical implant products. Recent global supply chain issues have created challenges in acquiring certain raw materials, component parts and supplies; however, the use of more than one supplier for these helps to mitigate the risk of shortages or delays in the global supply chain. We believe our sources of raw materials are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
Seasonality
Our European operations typically experience a slowdown during the July, August and December vacation seasons for our Fabrication Technology segment. Sales in our Medical Technology segment typically peak in the fourth quarter. However, the business impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as general economic conditions, including recent supply chain disruptions, have distorted and may continue to distort the effects of historical seasonality patterns and impact future seasonal variations.
Working Capital
We maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements related to working capital items.
Regulatory Environment
Our medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The FDA, for example, regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device’s development, design, pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, packaging, storage, premarket approval, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, promotion, distribution, sale and marketing, as well as modifications to existing products and the marketing of existing products for new indications. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market these products can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Additionally, modifications to our existing products may require new regulatory approvals and we may be required to cease marketing or to recall any modified product until we obtain clearance or approval.
Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations and other local, state and foreign requirements. Compliance with these requirements, including the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulators, which may result in observations (such as on Form 483), and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement. If the FDA or another regulator were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such products, refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications, refuse to provide certificates for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA or other regulators may also impose operating restrictions, including a ceasing of operations at one or more facilities, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA or other regulators could also issue a corporate warning letter, a recidivist warning letter, a consent decree of permanent injunction, and/or recommend prosecution. DJO has received FDA warning letters in the past, and we cannot assure you that the FDA will not take further action in the future.
Governmental regulations outside the United States have and may continue to become increasingly stringent and complex. In the EU, for example, the Medical Device Regulation (the “MDR”) was published in 2017 which, when it entered into full force in 2021, includes significant additional premarket and post-market requirements. In complying with the requirements of this regulation, we have incurred and will need to incur additional costs to comply, which may be significant. If we fail to meet the requirements of the new regulation, or are delayed in doing so, it could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. Additionally, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices from the United States to foreign countries and certain foreign countries may require FDA certification that our medical device products are in compliance with U.S. law. Failure to obtain or maintain export certificates required for the export of our products could materially adversely impact revenues and growth. 
Our Medical Technology business is also subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government, the federal Stark law, which prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated health services covered by the Medicare or Medicaid program, if the physician has a financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters, and similar state and foreign laws. These laws and regulations, among other things, constrain our business, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including royalty, marketing and consulting arrangements, and sales programs we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products or individuals or entities who recommend our products, and consignment stock and bill arrangements, such as our OfficeCare program. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions or safe harbors, it is possible that some of our activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Moreover, the federal government has significantly increased investigations of and enforcement activity involving medical device manufacturers with regard to alleged kickbacks and other forms of remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals who use and prescribe their products, as well as financial relationships with other third-party entities in a position to increase utilization of the products. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.
In addition, our Medical Technology business subjects us to federal privacy and transaction law and regulations. HIPAA and the HIPAA Rules impact the transmission, maintenance, use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”). As such, HIPAA and the HIPAA Rules apply to certain aspects of our Medical Technology business. There are costs and administrative burdens associated with ongoing compliance with the HIPAA Rules and similar state law requirements. Any failure to comply with current and applicable future requirements could adversely affect our profitability.
HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information, including PHI by health plans, certain healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers that submit certain covered transactions electronically (“covered entities”), and their “business associates,” which are persons or entities that perform certain services for, or on behalf of, a covered entity that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting PHI.
Further, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented similar privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if a state affords greater protection to individuals than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective, we may have to comply with the stricter provisions.
In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, and data protection laws, especially with respect to genetic samples and data, in the United States, the EU, and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux. We operate in a number of countries outside of the United States whose laws may in some cases be more stringent than the requirements in the United States.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 16,200 persons, of whom approximately 3,100 were employed in the United States and approximately 13,100 were employed outside of the United States. Approximately 1% of associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements with U.S. trade unions. In addition, approximately 46% of our associates are represented by foreign trade unions and work councils in Europe, Asia, Central and South America, Canada, Africa, and Australia, which could subject us to arrangements very similar to collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages or strikes that have had a material adverse impact on operations. We consider our relations with our associates to be good.
At Colfax, we believe that the best team wins. Our growth model is focused in part on acquiring good companies, empowering our talent and using Colfax Business Systems (CBS) to make them great. Culture and associate development are critical to our success. We are a diverse team of associates around the world. We empower our associates through our culture that is centered on our corporate purpose – “Creating Better Together.” We are committed to attracting and developing great talent and rewarding our associates to build and sustain our company. Our internal human capital management programs center on the following processes and objectives: (i) identifying, attracting, developing and enabling talent, (ii) promoting associate engagement and an open feedback culture to foster continuous improvement, (iii) offering competitive compensation and benefit programs to motivate associates and reward performance, (iv) building and supporting inclusion, diversity, and equity initiatives, and (v) protecting the health and safety of all of our associates across the world.
