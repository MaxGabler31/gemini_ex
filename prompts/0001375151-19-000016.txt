Company Overview
Zogenix, Inc. (Zogenix, We or the Company) is a pharmaceutical company developing and commercializing transformative central nervous system (CNS) therapies for people living with serious and life-threatening rare CNS disorders and medical conditions. We are currently focused on developing and commercializing CNS therapies to address rare, or “orphan” childhood-onset epilepsy disorders.
We currently own and control worldwide development and commercialization rights to Fintepla/ZX008, our lead product candidate. Fintepla is low-dose fenfluramine under development for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and catastrophic forms of childhood-onset epilepsy: Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). 
Dravet syndrome is a rare form of pediatric-onset epilepsy with life threatening consequences for patients and for which current treatment options are very limited. Fintepla has received orphan drug designation in the United States and the European Union (EU) for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. In addition, Fintepla for the treatment of Dravet syndrome received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2016. In February 2019, we completed our rolling submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA and submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. The EMA has accepted the MAA and initiated its review.
We initiated our Phase 3 clinical trials for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in North America (Study 1501) in January 2016 and in Europe and Australia in June 2016 (Study 1502). Study 1501 and Study 1502 are each identical randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of Fintepla as adjunctive therapy for patients with uncontrolled seizures who have Dravet syndrome. In January 2017, we announced our plan to report top-line results from Study 1501 and Study 1502 via a prospective merged study analysis approach whereby top-line results from the first approximately 120 subjects randomized into either Study 1501 or 1502 would have their study results analyzed and be reported initially as “Study 1”. In April 2017, we completed enrollment of Study 1 and, in September 2017, we announced positive top-line results for the 119 patients included in the Study 1 Phase 3 trial. The Study 1 trial met its primary objective of demonstrating that Fintepla, at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day (30mg/day maximum), is superior to placebo as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome in children and young adults based on change in the frequency of convulsive seizures between the 6-week baseline observation period and the 14-week treatment period (p<0.001). In the trial, Fintepla at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day also demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in all key secondary measures, including the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful reductions in seizure frequency (50% or greater) and longest seizure-free interval. The same analyses comparing a 0.2 mg/kg/day Fintepla dose versus placebo also demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared with placebo. Fintepla was generally well tolerated without any signs or symptoms of valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension. 
In September 2016, we initiated Cohort 1 of Study 1504 that investigated the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of Fintepla when co-administered with the stiripentol regimen (stiripentol, valproate and/or clobazam). Based on the results of the Cohort 1 pharmacokinetic and safety portion of the trial, in February 2017 we initiated the Cohort 2 safety and efficacy portion of Study 1504 utilizing a dose of Fintepla 0.5mg/kg/day (20mg/day maximum). Study 1504 Cohort 2, a two-arm study, compared Fintepla versus placebo across the titration and 12-week maintenance periods at multiple sites located in France, the Netherlands, United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain. In January 2018, we announced patient enrollment was complete at 87 patients, with 43 patients randomized into the Fintepla-arm and 44 patients randomized to the placebo arm. In July 2018, we reported positive top-line results from Cohort 2 of Study 1504. The study results, which are consistent with those reported in Study 1, successfully met the primary objective of demonstrating that Fintepla, at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day, when co-administered with stiripentol regimen (stiripentol, valproate and/or clobazam), was superior to placebo as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome in children and young adults based on change in the frequency of convulsive seizures between the 6-week baseline observation period and the 15-week treatment period (p<0.001). In the trial, Fintepla at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day also demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in all key secondary measures, the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful reductions in seizure frequency (50% or greater) and longest seizure-free interval. Fintepla was generally well-tolerated in this study, with the adverse events consistent with those observed in Study 1 and the known safety profile of fenfluramine without any signs or symptoms of valvular heart disease (valvulopathy) or pulmonary hypertension.   
Upon completion of our Fintepla Phase 3 trials, eligible patients were permitted to enroll in an ongoing open-label extension (OLE) trial to study the long-term safety and effectiveness of Fintepla (Study 1503). In December 2018, we presented interim data from Study 1503 regarding the effectiveness and overall safety of Fintepla observed in the study, including the long-term cardiovascular assessments and findings at the 72nd Annual Meeting of the American Epilepsy Society (AES). A total of 232 patients from Study 1503 were included in the interim analysis of the OLE trial. As of March 13, 2018, the interim
 cutoff date, the median duration of treatment with Fintepla was 256 days and the range was 58-634 days (equivalent to 161 patient-years of exposure to Fintepla). In this interim analysis population of 232 patients, a total of 22 (9.5%) patients had discontinued treatment for the following reasons: lack of efficacy (16), subject withdrawal (2), adverse event (1), Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) (1), physician decision (1), and withdrawal by caregiver (1). Approximately 90% of patients remained in the study at the time of the interim analysis. The median percent reduction in monthly convulsive seizure frequency over the entire OLE treatment period was 66.8% (compared with baseline frequency established in the core Phase 3 studies). Over the same period, 64.4% of children and young adults showed a >50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency and 41.2% showed a >75% reduction. The occurrence of adverse events was consistent with the Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10% of children and young adults were pyrexia (22%), nasopharyngitis (20%), decreased appetite (16%), influenza (12%), diarrhea (11%), and upper respiratory tract infection (10%). A total of 13.4% of children lost >7% body weight at some point during the trial; in 42% of those children weight loss abated during the period covered by the interim analysis. Over the course of the OLE treatment period, one patient died from SUDEP that was deemed unrelated to Fintepla. A total of 703 color doppler echocardiograms were performed to assess cardiovascular health at baseline, week 4 or 6, and then every 3 months during the OLE trial. No patient developed valvular heart disease (valvulopathy) or pulmonary arterial hypertension at any time after daily treatment with Fintepla. 
In February 2019, we completed our rolling submission of a NDA with the FDA and submitted a MAA to the EMA for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Both applications were based on data from Study 1 and Study 1504 in Dravet syndrome and the interim analysis from Study 1503. The EMA has accepted the MAA and initiated its review.
LGS is another rare, refractory, debilitating pediatric-onset epilepsy with life threatening consequences for patients and for which current treatment options are limited and suboptimal. Beginning in first quarter of 2016, we funded an open-label, dose-finding, investigator-initiated study of the effectiveness and tolerability of Fintepla as an adjunctive therapy in patients with LGS. In December 2016, we presented initial data from an interim analysis of the first 13 patients to have completed at least 12 weeks of this Phase 2 clinical trial at the 70th Annual Meeting of the AES. In this interim analysis, Fintepla was observed to provide clinically meaningful improvement in major motor seizure frequency in patients with severe refractory LGS, with 7 out of 13 patients (54%) achieving at least a 50% reduction in the number of major motor seizures, at doses below the 0.8 mg/kg/day maximum allowed dose. In addition, Fintepla was generally well tolerated without any observed signs or symptoms of valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension. We believe these data indicate that Fintepla has the potential to be a safe and effective adjunctive treatment of major motor seizures for patients with LGS. Based on the strength of the LGS data generated, in the first quarter of 2017, we submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the FDA to initiate a Phase 3 program of Fintepla in LGS. Our IND for Fintepla as a potential treatment for LGS became effective in April 2017. In the first half of 2017, Fintepla received orphan drug designation for the treatment of LGS from the FDA in the United States and the EMA in the EU. In November 2017, we announced the initiation of our multicenter global Phase 3 clinical trial of Fintepla as an adjunctive treatment for seizures in patients with LGS (Study 1601) and are currently enrolling patients into the study. In December 2018, we announced that we expect to complete enrollment for Study 1601 in the second half of 2019 and be able to announce top-line results from the study in the first quarter of 2020. 
Our Strategy
We are committed to developing and commercializing therapeutic solutions for people living with serious and life-threatening rare CNS disorders and medical conditions. Our strategy centers on developing and advancing our lead therapeutic product candidate, Fintepla, low-dose fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, LGS, and potentially other rare and catastrophic epilepsy disorders. In addition to Fintepla, we aim to identify, develop, and advance other transformative therapeutic product candidates with the potential to treat patients living with serious and life-threating rare CNS disorders. The key elements of our strategy are:
•Seek regulatory approval and commence commercialization of Fintepla for the treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome. In February 2019, we completed our rolling submission of a NDA with the FDA and submitted a MAA to the EMA for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Also in February 2019, we entered into a master supply agreement with Aptuit (Oxford) Limited, an Evotec company, or Aptuit, pursuant to which Aptuit will be our commercial manufacturer and supplier of the fenfluramine active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used in our product candidate Fintepla. We are continuing to build our internal commercial capabilities for potential commercialization.
•Developing Fintepla for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In November 2017, we announced the initiation of Study 1601 for Fintepla as an adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS with the enrollment of the first patient into the study. In December 2018, we announced that we expect to complete enrollment for Study 1601 in the second half of 2019 and be able to announce top-line results from the study in the first quarter of 2020. Fintepla received orphan drug designation for the treatment of LGS from the FDA and the EMA in the first half of 2017.
•Evaluating Fintepla for potential treatment of other forms of orphan pediatric epilepsy. In addition to Dravet syndrome and LGS, we believe that the unique mechanism of action of Fintepla has the potential to treat other epileptic encephalopathies where there is a significant unmet medical need. We expect to continue to evaluate its potential in additional orphan pediatric-onset epilepsy indications where there is a significant unmet medical need. For example, we are evaluating whether Fintepla has the potential to treat patients with Doose Syndrome, another rare pediatric epileptic encephalopathy that is often refractory to currently available anticonvulsant medication. There is currently no FDA approved medication for the treatment of seizures associated with Doose Syndrome. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 placebo-controlled trial in Doose Syndrome in the second half of 2019.
•Identifying transformative, differentiated, promising product development candidates in the therapeutic area of rare CNS disorders for acquisition and further development. Our business development team focuses on identifying and evaluating differentiated, high-value licensing and product acquisition opportunities that would build our CNS product candidate pipeline and effectively leverage our capabilities in the United States and Europe. 
Our Clinical Product Candidate 
We currently have one product candidate in clinical development being studied as a potential treatment for rare CNS disorders.
Fintepla (ZX008; Low-Dose Fenfluramine) for Patients with Dravet Syndrome 
Dravet syndrome is a rare childhood-onset channelopathy in which intractable epilepsy is one of the most significant and devastating symptoms. Children and young adults with Dravet syndrome experience debilitating, persistent and potentially life-threatening seizures beginning in the first year of life.  Seizures continue throughout their lifetime and are most often treatment resistant, meaning that currently available medications and therapies are not able to achieve complete or clinically meaningful seizure control and, in some cases, worsen the condition. Individuals with Dravet syndrome face a higher incidence of Status Epilepticus and SUDEP. These patients suffer from severe cognitive and other developmental impairment throughout life, as well as neurobehavioral disorders such as autistic-like behavior and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and motor abnormalities. The prognosis for patients with Dravet syndrome to become seizure free is poor. A recent study by Wu et. al. published by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2015 reported an incidence rate for Dravet syndrome of approximately 1 per 16,000 live births.
Prior to 2018, there were no FDA-approved treatments indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. In June 2018, the FDA approved the first treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome, Epidiolex® (cannabidiol or CBD) liquid oral solution and in August 2018, the FDA approved a second treatment, Diacomit® (stiripentol), for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients who are also taking clobazam. Prior to 2018, the standard of care for the treatment of seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome usually involved a combination of the following anticonvulsant drugs: clobazam, clonazepam, levetiracetam, topiramate, valproic acid, ethosuximide and zonisamide. In addition to the United States, stiripentol is approved in Europe, Canada, Australia and Japan for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in conjunction with valproate and/or clobazam. In Europe, stiripentol was granted an orphan drug designation for the treatment of Dravet syndrome in 2001. Sodium channel blocking anticonvulsant drugs often used to treat most other epilepsy conditions increase seizure frequency in patients with Dravet syndrome. Management of this disease may also include a nonpharmacologic treatments, including ketogenic diet and vagal nerve stimulation.
Fenfluramine was originally developed and approved as an anorectic agent for the treatment of adult obesity. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence of the drug’s ability to treat refractory pediatric epileptic seizures was first described in the 1980s. Fenfluramine was withdrawn from the market in 1997 because the risk outweighed the benefit in this adult obese population, after cases of heart valve defects and pulmonary hypertension were reported in adults who had taken fenfluramine, most often with phentermine. However, at this time, academic pediatric neurologists in Belgium continued to evaluate low doses of fenfluramine in a small number of refractory patients under a government approved compassionate use protocol. Their open-label study, which continues today, evaluated the safety and effectiveness of low-dose fenfluramine to reduce seizures in refractory Dravet syndrome patients. 
In December 2016, we presented the most recent analyses of the original Dravet syndrome patients being treated in Belgium under this government approved protocol at the 70th AES Annual Meeting. At that time ten original patients who started treatment with fenfluramine prior to 2010 had been treated with low-dose fenfluramine for a mean of 17.5 years (range: 7-28 years) From the analysis, low-dose fenfluramine, as an adjunctive therapy to standard antiepileptic drugs, was providing these difficult to treat patients with long-term, durable seizure control. As reported at the meeting, for the most immediate past six years of treatment leading up to the analysis, three patients were seizure-free for the entire six years and four patients experienced seizure-free intervals of at least two years. None of these patients developed any clinically meaningful signs or symptoms of cardiac valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension, while two patients had mild and stable cardiac valve thickening
 on the most recent cardiac echocardiogram that was deemed to be clinically unimportant. After 2010, an additional 11 Dravet syndrome patients started adjuvant treatment with low-dose fenfluramine under the Belgium government approved protocol and data on this cohort was presented at the 71st AES Annual Meeting. The mean age at start of fenfluramine in this cohort was 12.5 years (range, 1- 30 years) and treatment with fenfluramine was for a median duration of 3.0 years (range, 1- 7 years). Ninety-one percent of these patients had a clinically meaningful reduction (≥50%) and 73% had substantial reductions (≥75%) in major motor seizure frequency at the prior visit. Fenfluramine was generally well tolerated with no clinical and/or echocardiographic signs of cardiac valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension. In this ongoing Belgian study of low dose fenfluramine treating refractory Dravet syndrome patients, no patient has stopped treatment for any adverse event.
Because of the known cardiac side effects of fenfluramine reported when prescribed in higher doses for the treatment of adult obesity (without baseline cardiac data), the ongoing Belgian study requires ongoing periodic evaluations of the heart and, in particular, the heart valves and measures assessing for the presence of pulmonary hypertension using echocardiography. Overall, low-dose fenfluramine has been shown to be well tolerated and side-effects of treatment have been mild and transient over the entire 29-year study period. There have been no clinically significant findings related to cardiac valvulopathy and no reports of pulmonary hypertension in any Fintepla or low-dose fenfluramine studies to date.
We have participated in formal meetings with regulatory agencies in the United States and the EU to obtain concurrence on remaining pre-clinical and clinical requirements for regulatory approval. Based upon this information, we believe our two pivotal placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies in Dravet syndrome will be sufficient to support an application for regulatory approval of Fintepla in the United States and in Europe. The FDA accepted our IND for Fintepla for the treatment of Dravet syndrome in December 2015. We initiated our Phase 3 clinical trials in North America (Study 1501) in January 2016 and in Europe and Australia in June 2016 (Study 1502). Study 1501 and Study 1502 are each identical randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of Fintepla as adjunctive therapy for patients with uncontrolled seizures who have Dravet syndrome. In January 2017, we announced our plan to report top-line results from Study 1501 and Study 1502 via a prospective merged study analysis approach whereby top-line results from the first approximately 120 subjects randomized into either Study 1501 or 1502 would have their study results analyzed and be reported initially as “Study 1.” In April 2017, we completed enrollment of Study 1 and, in September 2017, we announced positive top-line results for the 119 patients included in the Study 1 Phase 3 trial. The Study 1 trial met its primary objective of demonstrating that Fintepla, at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day, was superior to placebo as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome in children and young adults based on change in the frequency of convulsive seizures between the 6-week baseline observation period and the 14-week treatment period (p<0.001). In the trial Fintepla 0.8 mg/kg/day also demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in all key secondary measures, including the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful reductions (50% or greater) in convulsive seizure frequency and longest seizure-free interval. The same analyses comparing a 0.2 mg/kg/day Fintepla dose versus placebo also resulted in statistically significant improvement compared with placebo. Patients completing the Phase 3 trials are given the opportunity to enroll in an open label long-term extension safety study (Study 1503).
In September 2016, we initiated Part 1 of Study 1504, a two-part, double blind, randomized, two arm pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of Fintepla in Dravet syndrome patients who are taking stiripentol, valproate and/or clobazam as part of their baseline standard care. Part 1 investigated the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of Fintepla when co-administered with the stiripentol regimen (stiripentol, valproate and/or clobazam). Based on the results of the pharmacokinetic and safety portion of the trial, in February 2017 we initiated the safety and efficacy portion of Study 1504 utilizing a dose of Fintepla 0.5mg/kg/day (20mg/day maximum). Study 1504, a two-arm study, compared Fintepla versus placebo across the titration and 12-week maintenance periods at multiple sites located the Netherlands, United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain. In January 2018, we announced patient enrollment was complete at 87 patients, with 43 patients randomized into the Fintepla-arm and 44 patients randomized to the placebo arm.
In July 2018, we reported positive top-line results from Cohort 2 of Study 1504. The study results, which are consistent with those reported in Study 1, successfully met the primary objective of demonstrating that Fintepla, at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day, when co-administered with stiripentol regimen (stiripentol, valproate and/or clobazam), was superior to placebo as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome in children and young adults based on change in the frequency of convulsive seizures between the 6-week baseline observation period and the 15-week treatment period (p<0.001). In the trial, Fintepla at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day also demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in all key secondary measures, the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful reductions in seizure frequency (50% or greater) and longest seizure-free interval. Fintepla was generally well-tolerated in this study, with the adverse events consistent with those observed in Study 1 and the known safety profile of fenfluramine without any signs or symptoms of valvular heart disease (valvulopathy) or pulmonary hypertension.
Upon completion of our Fintepla Phase 3 trials, eligible patients were permitted to enroll in an ongoing OLE trial to study the long-term safety and effectiveness of Fintepla (Study 1503). In December 2018, we presented interim data from Study 1503 regarding the effectiveness and overall safety of Fintepla observed in the study, including the long-term cardiovascular
 assessments and findings at the 72nd Annual Meeting of the AES. A total of 232 patients from Study 1503 were included in the interim analysis of the OLE trial. As of March 13, 2018, the interim cutoff date, the median duration of treatment with Fintepla was 256 days and the range was 58-634 days (equivalent to 161 patient-years of exposure to Fintepla). In this interim analysis population of 232 patients, a total of 22 (9.5%) patients had discontinued treatment for the following reasons: lack of efficacy (16), subject withdrawal (2), adverse event (1), SUDEP (1), physician decision (1), and withdrawal by caregiver (1). Approximately 90% of patients remained in the study at the time of the interim analysis. The median percent reduction in monthly convulsive seizure frequency over the entire OLE treatment period was 66.8% (compared with baseline frequency established in the core Phase 3 studies). Over the same period, 64.4% of children and young adults showed a >50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency and 41.2% showed a >75% reduction.
The occurrence of adverse events was consistent with the Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10% of children and young adults were pyrexia (22%), nasopharyngitis (20%), decreased appetite (16%), influenza (12%), diarrhea (11%), and upper respiratory tract infection (10%). A total of 13.4% of children lost >7% body weight at some point during the trial; in 42% of those children weight loss abated during the period covered by the interim analysis. Over the course of the OLE treatment period included in the interim analysis, one patient died from SUDEP that was deemed unrelated to Fintepla. A total of 703 color doppler echocardiograms were performed to assess cardiovascular health at baseline, week 4 or 6, and then every 3 months during the OLE trial. No patient developed valvular heart disease (valvulopathy) or pulmonary arterial hypertension at any time after daily treatment with Fintepla.
In February 2019, we completed our rolling submission of a NDA with the FDA and submitted a MAA to the EMA for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. The EMA has accepted the MAA and initiated its review. In the event that the FDA requires a risk management plan (RMP) as a condition of approval to manage potential risks through education, labeling, and monitoring where appropriate, we are currently developing the appropriate elements of an RMP for Fintepla in the United States, as well as a similar RMP for Europe. This is consistent with other drugs with known safety issues that are approved for serious diseases with high unmet need.
Fintepla for Patients with LGS
LGS is a severe, refractory and debilitating form of epilepsy that typically becomes apparent during early childhood. Affected children experience generalized tonic-clonic seizures, tonic seizures, atonic seizures, and tonic/atonic seizures, all of which can result in “drop attacks.” Other seizure types that occur in some LGS patients include non-convulsive seizures, such as atypical absences, focal seizures, and myoclonic seizures. Children with LGS most often also develop cognitive dysfunction, delays in reaching developmental milestones and behavioral problems. LGS can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, but in some cases no cause can be identified.
LGS makes up 1% to 4% of all pediatric epilepsies. There is no specific therapy for LGS that is effective in all cases and the disorder has proven particularly resistant to most currently available therapeutic options. The three main therapeutic options for the treatment of LGS are anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), dietary therapy (typically the ketogenic diet) or surgery (VNS therapy or corpus callosotomy). AEDs are usually prescribed to individuals with LGS, but the individual response is highly variable. However, because individuals with LGS rarely respond successfully to one AED, they most often require polypharmacotherapy with multiple AEDs, and yet still most continue to have refractory seizures. Although a variety of specific drugs have been approved by the FDA and/or EMA for the treatment of LGS including Epidiolex (cannabidiol), topiramate, lamotrigine, clobazam, rufinamide, felbamate and clonazepam, these medications typically have limited success and in addition, are often associated with intolerable side effects, especially in individuals who receive multidrug, high-dose regimens. Furthermore, all current AEDs can also become less effective over time.
Beginning in first quarter of 2016, we funded an open-label, dose-finding, investigator-initiated study of the effectiveness and tolerability of Fintepla as an adjunctive therapy in patients with LGS. In December 2016, we presented initial data from an interim analysis of the first 13 patients to have completed at least 12 weeks of this Phase 2 clinical trial at the 70th Annual Meeting of the AES. In this interim analysis, Fintepla was observed to provide clinically meaningful improvement in major motor seizure frequency in patients with severe refractory LGS, with 7 out of 13 patients (54%) achieving at least a 50% reduction in the number of major motor seizures, at doses below the 0.8 mg/kg/day maximum allowed dose. In addition, Fintepla was generally well tolerated without any observed signs or symptoms of valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension. We believe these data indicate that Fintepla has the potential to be a safe and effective adjunctive treatment of major motor seizures for patients with LGS. Based on the strength of the LGS data generated, in the first quarter of 2017, we submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the FDA to initiate a Phase 3 program of Fintepla in LGS. Our IND for Fintepla as a potential treatment for LGS became effective in April 2017. In the first half of 2017, Fintepla received orphan drug designation for the treatment of LGS from the FDA in the United States and the EMA in the EU. In November 2017, we announced the initiation of our multicenter global Phase 3 clinical trial of Fintepla as an adjunctive treatment for seizures in patients with LGS (Study 1601) and are currently enrolling patients into the study. In December 2018, we announced that we
 expect to complete enrollment for Study 1601 in the second half of 2019 and be able to announce top-line results from the study in the first quarter of 2020. 
Beyond Dravet syndrome and LGS, we also intend to evaluate Fintepla’s potential to treat additional indications in other rare pediatric-onset epileptic encephalopathies such as Doose Syndrome and related medical conditions in the future.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and differentiated therapeutics. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our product candidates, including large pharmaceutical companies, smaller biopharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, research and development capabilities, sales and marketing capabilities, manufacturing capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates and/or other resources than us. We will face competition not only in the commercialization of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities, but also for the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates.
Fintepla
Prior to 2018, there were no FDA-approved treatments indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. The standard of care for the treatment of seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome usually involved a combination of the following anticonvulsant drugs: clobazam, clonazepam, levetiracetam, topiramate, valproic acid, ethosuximide and zonisamide. In June 2018, the FDA approved the first treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome, as well as LGS, GW Pharmaceuticals’ Epidiolex® (cannabidiol or CBD). Epidiolex is a liquid drug formulation of plant-derived purified CBD, which is a chemical component of the Cannabis sativa plant, more commonly known as marijuana. In August 2018, the FDA approved a second treatment, Biocodex’s Diacomit® (stiripentol), for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients who are also taking clobazam. Stiripentol is approved in Europe, Canada and Japan for the treatment of Dravet syndrome when used in conjunction with valproate and/or clobazam. GW Pharmaceuticals plc has filed a MAA in Europe for CBD in Dravet syndrome and LGS.
Fintepla has a novel mechanism of action (selective serotonin activity and possibly sigma-1 activity) that is different from the other antiepileptic drugs currently available and in clinical development in the United States and the EU for the treatment of epileptic encephalopathies like Dravet syndrome, including cannabidiol or stiripentol. Currently approved drugs have a different and distinct mechanism of action from Fintepla. As such, we do not expect the recent approvals of cannabidiol or stiripentol in the United States or Europe will block the FDA or EMA from granting approval of Fintepla.
Insys Therapeutics (Insys) is developing a synthetic CBD for the treatment of pediatric epilepsies, including Dravet syndrome. Insys previously advanced its synthetic CBD program, which has received orphan drug designation and Fast Track status by the FDA for use of CBD as a potential treatment for Dravet syndrome, into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Insys initiated Phase 2 development of its CBD product candidate for childhood absence epilepsy in December of 2017 and initiated a Phase 3 trial in infantile spasms, a pediatric epilepsy syndrome in the first quarter of 2018. 
Ovid Therapeutics, Inc. is currently evaluating its product candidate OV935, a first-in-class inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H), for the potential treatment of adult and pediatric patients with Dravet syndrome and LGS in Phase 2 clinical trials.
Several other companies, including Xenon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Stoke Therapeutics, Inc. have disclosed that they are developing preclinical drug candidates for the potential treatment of Dravet syndrome.
Manufacturing and Supply
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish or own any manufacturing facilities with respect to the manufacture of Fintepla or any future product candidates. In February 2019, we entered into a master supply agreement with Aptuit pursuant to which Aptuit will be our commercial manufacturer and supplier of the fenfluramine API used in Fintepla. The term of the master supply agreement is five years, which term shall be automatically extended for successive two year periods thereafter, unless terminated earlier. Aptuit has been providing the API to us for our clinical trial material supply needs and registration batches for the past several years. 
We expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates and their component raw materials for use in our internal research efforts and clinical trials and in relation to any future commercialization of our product candidates. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for obtaining the raw materials
 necessary to manufacture our product candidates, which we believe are readily available from more than one source. Additional third-party manufacturers are and will be used to formulate, fill, label, package and distribute investigational drug products and eventually our products, if and when our product candidates receive approval. This approach allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure while enabling us to focus our expertise on developing and commercializing our product candidates. Although we believe we have multiple potential sources for the manufacture of our product candidates and their related raw materials, we currently rely on single manufacturers for different aspects of manufacturing Fintepla.
Strategic and License Agreements
In October 2014,we acquired Brabant Pharma Limited (Brabant) and obtained worldwide development and commercialization rights to Fintepla (ZX008; low-dose fenfluramine), its lead product candidate. Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, we agreed to make future milestone payments to the former owners of Brabant for up to $95.0 million in the event we achieve certain milestones with respect to Fintepla, consisting of $50.0 million in regulatory-related milestones and $45.0 million in sales-related milestones. In February 2019, we completed our rolling submission of a NDA with the FDA and submitted a MAA to the EMA for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. The EMA has accepted the MAA, which triggered a $10.0 million development milestone payment. An additional $10.0 million milestone payment shall become due and payable if our NDA is accepted by the FDA.
In addition, we have a collaboration and license agreement with the Universities of Antwerp and Leuven in Belgium (the Universities) that runs through September 2045. Under the terms of the agreement, the Universities granted us an exclusive worldwide license to use the data obtained from a study related to fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, as well as certain other intellectual property. We are required to pay a mid-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of Fintepla for the treatment of Dravet syndrome or, in the case of a sublicense of Fintepla for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a percentage in the mid-twenties of the sub-licensing revenues. The agreement may be terminated by the Universities if we: (a) do not use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) develop and commercialize Fintepla for the treatment of Dravet syndrome or related conditions stemming from infantile epilepsy, or (ii) seek approval of Fintepla for the treatment of Dravet syndrome in the United States; or (b) if we become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should any petition in bankruptcy, or similar relief, be filed by or against us. We can terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice to the Universities. 
Intellectual Property
Our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to obtain, expand and protect our intellectual property estate, enforce patents, maintain trade secret and trademark protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties.
As of December 31, 2018, we have rights to four issued U.S. patents and two issued foreign patents, one of which is involved in an Opposition Proceeding in the European Patent Office. These patents, entitled “Method for the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome,” cover claims related to methods for treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome with Fintepla and are expected to provide protection of the associated claims in the U.S. and other countries through 2033 and 2034, respectively. In addition, we also have 36 currently pending U.S. patent applications (which includes six provisional applications) and 74 pending foreign applications (which includes two allowed South Africa applications and seven Patent Cooperation Treaty applications) in the Fintepla series of patent cases. Our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any additional patents.
Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, record keeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
•completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practice (GCP) regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
•submission, review and approval to the FDA of an NDA; and
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements.
The pre-clinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted by the FDA on a timely basis, if at all. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, potency, biological activity, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some pre-clinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials, pre-clinical information or cGMP requirements and places a trial on clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage.
•Phase 3: When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken in large patient populations to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites.
In some cases, the FDA may condition the approval of the NDA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical studies to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Post-Marketing or Phase 4 studies. 
The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) and proposed labeling, among other things. In February 2019, we submitted a NDA to the FDA for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. 
For some drugs, the FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug, and may require submission of a REMS as a condition of approval. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA considers the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, the expected benefit of the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the size of the population likely to use the drug, , the duration of treatment, , and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry or undergo certain health evaluations and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy, at a minimum, at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval. The submission of an NDA is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the
 manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
During the FDA’s review of an NDA the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP, and if applicable, quality system regulation (“QSR”) requirements (for medical device components), and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements before approving an NDA. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Once the FDA’s NDA review process is substantially complete, it may issue an approval letter, or it may issue a complete response letter (CRL) to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
The FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or a post-market REMS requirement. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the sponsor is required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require the development of additional data or conduct of additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials.
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Unique to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goals. 
In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug. In February 2018, granted breakthrough therapy designation for Fintepla in the United States for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. For example, the FDA may rescind breakthrough therapy designation for Fintepla based on an assessment of whether Fintepla continues to meet the criteria for breakthrough therapy designation in light of the FDA’s approval in June 2018 of Epidiolex for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and the FDA’s approval in August 2018 of Diacomit for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients who are also taking clobazam and neither Epidiolex nor Diacomit was approved as an existing therapy at the time the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for Fintepla.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug/device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There also are extensive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulations applicable to marketed controlled substances.
Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP or QSR requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP or QSR and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP or QSR compliance.
The FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market, though the FDA must provide an application holder with notice and an opportunity for a hearing in order to withdraw its approval of an application. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug and device products that are placed on the market. While physicians may prescribe drugs and devices for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) and associated FDA regulations, which governs the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws
 limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution, including a drug pedigree which tracks the distribution of prescription drugs. With the enactment of the Drug Quality and Security Act in November 2013, drug manufacturers will also be subject to requirements for identifying and tracking prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. The requirements of this law will be phased in over a ten-year period, including requirements for unique product identifiers and provision of product handling information to the FDA.
The FDA may require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds they are appropriate based on available data, including information regarding related drugs. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug. The FDA also has the authority to require a REMS to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary for a new drug, the drug sponsor must submit a proposed REMS as part of its NDA prior to approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry or undergo certain health evaluations and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy, at a minimum, at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval.
The FDA may require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds they are appropriate based on available data, including information regarding related drugs. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug. The FDA also has the authority to require a REMS to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. The FDA may impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks. 
With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes a number of complex requirements on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FFDCA, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000, there is no reasonable expectation that sales of the drug in the United States will be sufficient to offset the costs of developing and making the drug available in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If the FDA approves a sponsor’s marketing application for a designated orphan drug for use in the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the sponsor is eligible for a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, during which the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for a drug with the same active moiety and intended for the same use or indication as the approved orphan drug, except in limited circumstances, such as if a subsequent sponsor demonstrates its product is clinically superior. During a sponsor’s orphan drug exclusivity period, competitors, however, may receive approval for drugs with different active moieties for the same indication as the approved orphan drug, or for drugs with the same active moiety as the approved orphan drug, but for different indications. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for a drug with the same active moiety intended for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that grounds for withdrawal of the orphan drug exclusivity exist, or that our product is clinically superior. Further, if a designated orphan drug receives marketing approval for
 an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received orphan drug designation, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Fintepla has received orphan drug designation in the United States and the EU for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and LGS. We may seek orphan drug designation for Fintepla for a different indication, or other product candidates, but the FDA may disagree with our analysis of the prevalence of the particular disease or condition or other criteria for designation and refuse to grant orphan status. We cannot guarantee that we will obtain orphan drug designation or approval for any product candidate, or that we will be able to secure orphan drug exclusivity if we do obtain approval.
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
An applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA to seek approval for modifications or new uses of products previously approved by the FDA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product based on the prior pre-clinical or clinical trials conducted for the approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform new studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on studies conducted for a previously approved drug product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s current list of “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” known as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. The Section 505(b)(2) NDA application also will not be accepted or approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a New Chemical Entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired.
If the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the referenced NDA and patent holders once the 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge based on the Paragraph IV certification. Under the FFDCA, if a patent infringement lawsuit is filed against the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant within 45 days of receipt of the Paragraph IV certification notice, an automatic stay of approval is imposed, which prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months, or until a court decision or settlement finding that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed, whichever is earlier. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen the 30 month stay if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized.
The 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may be eligible for its own regulatory exclusivity period, such as three-year new product exclusivity. The first approved 505(b)(2) applicant for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new extended-release formulation for a previously approved product, may be granted three-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity if one or more clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA is precluded from making effective any other application for the same condition of use or for a change to the drug product that was granted exclusivity until after that three-year exclusivity period has expired. Additional exclusivities may also apply, such as an added six-month pediatric exclusivity period based on studies conducted in pediatric patients under a written request from the FDA.
Additionally, the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may list its own relevant patents in the Orange Book, and if it does, it can initiate patent infringement litigation against subsequent applicants that challenge such patents, which could result in a 30-month stay delaying those applicants.
DEA Regulation
The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA) establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. 
Fenfluramine, the active ingredient in Fintepla, is currently regulated as a Schedule IV drug in the United States. Substances in Schedule IV are considered to have a low potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedule III. A prescription for controlled substances in Schedules III, IV, and V issued by a practitioner, may be communicated either orally, in writing, or by facsimile to the pharmacist, and may be refilled if so authorized on the prescription or by call-in. Many commonly prescribed sleep aids (e.g., Ambien®, Sonata®), most benzodiazepines (e.g., Ativan®, Valium®, Versed®, Diastat®, Onfi®) and some weight loss drugs (e.g., Belviq®, Qsymia®) are also regulated as Schedule IV drugs.
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and authorization must be obtained to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could eventuate in criminal proceedings.
Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable and respective regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval and, if applicable, DEA classification. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Under EU regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. In February 2019, we submitted a MAA for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome under a centralized procedure to the EMA, which has accepted the MAA and initiated its review.
In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we are subject to a variety of other foreign regulations governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement and commercial distribution of our products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws are applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA, such as us, and hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products.
In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the TRICARE, Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Moreover, the lack of uniform court interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute makes compliance with the law difficult. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal health care program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some cases, and do not contain safe harbors or statutory exceptions. Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and have brought cases against numerous pharmaceutical and medical device companies, and certain sales and marketing personnel for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business or reward past purchases or recommendations.
Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of $11,463 to $22,927 for each separate false claim. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price and improper promotion of off-label uses (i.e., uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug’s label). In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. 
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance with such beneficiary inducement provision of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law can result in civil money penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created several new federal crimes, including health care fraud, and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the PPACA, also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on drug manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers, and any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1.105 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Manufacturers are required to report such data to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year.
Under California law, pharmaceutical companies must adopt a comprehensive compliance program that is in accordance with both the Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (OIG Guidance) and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals (PhRMA Code). The PhRMA Code seeks to promote transparency in relationships between health care professionals and the pharmaceutical industry and to ensure that pharmaceutical marketing activities comport with the highest ethical standards. The PhRMA Code contains strict limitations on certain interactions between health care professionals and the pharmaceutical industry relating to gifts, meals, entertainment and speaker programs, among others. Also, certain states have imposed restrictions on the types of interactions that pharmaceutical companies or their agents (e.g., sales representatives) may have with health care professionals, including bans or strict limitations on the provision of meals, entertainment, hospitality, travel and lodging expenses, and other financial support, including funding for continuing medical education activities.
Federal and state government price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs. Such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on marketed products. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements subject manufacturers to potentially significant discounts on products, increased infrastructure costs, and potentially limit the ability to offer certain marketplace discounts.
Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws
We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included sweeping expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, the new law makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates” — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition to HIPAA and HITECH, there are state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and CCPA), that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our collaborators.
We are also subject to foreign privacy laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we sell our testing products. The interpretation, application and interplay of consumer and health-related data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. For example, the European Union enacted Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR), has been enacted in the European Union and went into full effect in May 2018. These texts introduce many changes to privacy and security in the European Union, including stricter rules on consent and security duties for critical industries, including for the health sector. The interpretation of some rules is still unclear, and some requirements will be completed by national legislation. More generally, foreign laws and interpretations governing data privacy and security are constantly evolving and it is possible that laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with current practices, subjecting entities to government-imposed fines or orders. These fines can be very high. For instance, the GDPR introduces fines of up to EUR 20 million or 4% of a group’s worldwide annual turnover for certain infringements. In addition, privacy regulations differ widely from country to country.
Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our product candidates, if and when commercialized, will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Third-party payors include governmental programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care plans. These third
-party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost-containment mechanisms and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments.
Changes in third-party payor coverage and reimbursement rules can impact our business. For example, the PPACA changes include increased rebates a manufacturer must pay to the Medicaid program, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must provide 50% point-of-sale discounts on products covered under Part D. Further, the law imposes a significant annual, nondeductible fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with health care practitioners. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the point-of-sale discount manufacturers must agree to offer under the Medicare part D coverage gap discount program from 50% to 70%, starting in 2019. Additionally, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas (“Texas District Court Judge”), ruled that the entire PPACA is invalid based primarily on the fact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA, on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. While the Texas District Court Judge, as well as the current presidential administration and CMS, have stated that this ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA. PPACA and other healthcare reform measures continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, as well as increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
Manufacturing Requirements
We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable FDA regulations relating to FDA’s cGMP regulations and, if applicable, QSR requirements. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 90 full-time employees. Of the full-time employees, 60 were engaged in product development, quality assurance and clinical development and regulatory activities, 7 were engaged in sales and marketing and 23 were engaged in general and administrative activities (including business and corporate development). 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. We currently utilize two employer services companies to provide human resource services. These service companies are the employer of record for payroll, benefits, employee relations and other employment-related administration.
