Overview
 
MAM Software Group, Inc. (“MAM,” "the Company," “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a leading provider of cloud-based business and on-premise management solutions for the auto parts, tires and vertical distribution industries. We have a broad line of software solutions and services to address the information technology (“IT”) needs of virtually every significant sector of the automotive aftermarket in the United Kingdom (“UK”) and Ireland (collectively referred to as the “UK Market”) and in the United States of America (“US”) and Canada (collectively referred to as the “NA Market”), and are seeking to leverage this position into new geographic territories and industry verticals.
Our Markets
 
MAM provides software, information, and e-commerce and related services to businesses engaged in the automotive aftermarket in the UK Market and the US Market. The automotive aftermarket consists of businesses associated with the life cycle of a motor vehicle from when the original manufacturer’s warranty expires to when the vehicle is scrapped. Products sold by businesses engaged in this market include the parts, tires and auto services required to maintain and improve the performance or appeal of a vehicle throughout its useful life. We aim to meet the business needs of customers who are involved in the maintenance and repair of automobiles and light trucks in three key segments of the automotive aftermarket, namely parts, tires and auto service.
 
Our customer base consists of wholesale parts and tire distributors, retailers, franchisees, cooperatives, auto service chains and single location auto service businesses with high customer service expectations and complex commercial relationships.
 
In the UK Market, we also provide solutions to businesses involved in the wholesale of construction materials. These vertical markets include plumbing, building, lumber, and electrical wholesale distribution companies. We currently do not provide management solutions for vertical markets in North America (“NA”).
 
Industry Overview

MAM serves the business needs of customers involved in the supply of parts and tires and the maintenance and repair of automobiles and light trucks in three key segments of the automotive aftermarket, namely parts, tires and auto service.
 
The global automotive aftermarket is witnessing stable growth due to the increased vehicle fleet and the demand for replaceable parts, tires and accessories. An increase in motor vehicle accidents is driving demand for external bodywork components. However, as the quality of aftermarket products improve, the longevity of these products increases and failures become less frequent, leading to a potential decrease in demand.
 
The major factors currently influencing market behavior include the geopolitical landscapes in the UK and NA, and the presence of traditionally non-automotive e-commerce participants like Amazon. The increasing digitalization of cars and components also presents challenges and opportunities to the sector as it strives to keep pace with advanced vehicle technology, data driven servicing and the changing needs of motorists.
 
Nonetheless, we believe that the automotive aftermarket will continue to grow, driven by the following factors:
 

• | gradual growth in the aggregate number of vehicles in use; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | an increase in the average age of vehicles in operation, now estimated to be 11.6 years in the US;
• | growth in the total number of miles driven per vehicle per year; and 
• | increased vehicle complexity. 

 
Currently, both the UK and NA automotive aftermarkets are experiencing significant growth in the online purchase of automotive parts, accessories and services. This is driving many businesses to leverage e-commerce technology to streamline their sales, inventory and delivery operations. Both business to business (“B2B”) (wholesale), and business to customer (“B2C”) (retail), businesses are looking to develop digital solutions that add value and increase competitiveness. The growing consumer adoption of e-commerce is also beginning to disrupt the traditional supply chain as suppliers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) modify their business models and participate in direct retail sales.

Operations
 
MAM is a technology company that operates through three wholly owned subsidiaries; one based in the US, MAM Software, Inc. (“MAM NA”) which is located in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and two based in the UK, MAM Software Limited (“MAM Ltd.”), which is located in Tankersley, Barnsley, UK and Origin Software Solutions Ltd. (“Origin”), which is located in Bristol, UK (MAM Ltd. and Origin are collectively referred to as “MAM UK”). The subsidiaries operate independently from one another.
MAM UK
 
MAM UK is a provider of software to the automotive aftermarket in the UK and Ireland. MAM UK’s three primary software solutions are Autopart, Autowork Online and Autocat. Autopart is designed for and targeted at parts store chains that seek to manage multiple locations and inventories on a single system for a regional area. It is also suited for managing single location franchisees or buying group members. Autowork Online is designed for and targeted at small single location auto service business. Autocat is an electronic parts catalog designed to help Autopart and Autowork Online users to identify parts.
 
MAM UK provides to customers a range of B2B and B2C e-commerce solutions for the automotive aftermarket.
 
MAM NA
 
MAM NA is a provider of software to the automotive aftermarket in NA. MAM NA’s three primary software solutions are Autopart, VAST, VAST Online and Autocat. Autopart is designed for the warehouse distributor and the parts store segment of the market and VAST and VAST Online are designed for the auto service and tire segment of the market, while Autocat is an electronic parts catalog designed to help Autopart, VAST and VAST Online users to identify parts.
Our Technologies
 
All MAM programs are based on the Microsoft® Windows® family of operating systems. Each MAM program is fully compatible with the other MAM applications in its range, enabling them to be combined to create a fully integrated package.
 
Our solutions are available as both “on-premise” applications (sold via the traditional perpetual licensing model) and “cloud” solutions that are delivered as a service over the Internet on a subscription basis.
 
Many of our business management applications are now available as software as a service (“SaaS”) solutions, where software and associated data is centrally hosted on the cloud.
 

• | SaaS cloud hosting - single tenants accessing fully-managed virtual servers via thin client (terminal services) connections (e.g. Autopart Online).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | SaaS web application - multiple tenants accessing a dedicated website using a standard web browser (e.g. Autowork Online). 

 
Our catalog information is also available in the cloud as data as a service (“DaaS”). We centrally host and maintain the data, which is accessed by users of our business management software, via a desktop application, web application or integrated into their B2B or B2C website.
 
Market acceptance of cloud computing for mission critical enterprise applications has become increasingly common in recent years. Now, software can be delivered cost-effectively, reliably, and securely to businesses over the Internet without the need for these businesses to either purchase supporting software and hardware for an on-premise system or the need to keep IT people on staff to monitor and upgrade such a system.
 
We introduced our first subscription-based service solution over the Internet in 2005 to customers in the UK Market, and we began marketing our first cloud system to customers in the NA Market in 2013. Since that time, we have significantly expanded our cloud-based offerings and are offering customers that maintain in-house installations the option to move to our cloud-computing model. While transitioning our customers to a cloud computing model results in a decrease in our up-front revenue recognition, we believe that this is a necessary transition and is in the best interests of our customers and our own long-term business prospects as an increasing number of our customers are looking for solutions that are highly functional, easy to use, configurable, and fast.

Our cloud model is based on Microsoft® Azure, Microsoft development tools, and proven open source web technologies, utilizing Microsoft's global scale services to help our customers achieve success with support for user experiences on both desktop and mobile devices. Our customers that have moved away from traditional on-premise software to our cloud-based service applications benefit by reducing the complexity typical of on-premise software implementations, customizations, and upgrades. Through cloud-based service, we supply and manage the hardware, infrastructure, ongoing maintenance, and backup services for our customers. We install the latest version of our software for our customers, thereby reducing their need to buy and maintain their own IT resources. As a part of our cloud-based service, we also provide training and support services to our customers.

We offer training at facilities in both the UK and US, as well as at the customers’ facilities and online, for product updates or to introduce specific new capabilities.
 
Distribution
 
There are three primary distribution channels for aftermarket parts and tire distribution: traditional wholesale, retail and e-commerce channels.
 
 5




Automotive Aftermarket Distribution Channels
 

• | Traditional Wholesale Channel. The traditional wholesale channel is the predominant distribution channel in the automotive aftermarket. It is characterized by the distribution of parts from the manufacturer to a warehouse distributor, to parts stores and then to automotive service providers. Warehouse distributors sell to automotive service providers through parts stores, which are positioned geographically near the automotive service providers they serve. This distribution method provides for the rapid distribution of parts. We have products and services that meet the needs of the warehouse distributors, parts stores and the automotive service providers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Retail Channel. The retail channel is comprised of large specialty retailers, small independent parts stores and regional chains that sell to “do-it-yourself” customers. Larger specialty retailers, such as Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, Inc., and O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. carry a greater number of parts and accessories at more attractive prices than smaller retail outlets and are gaining market share. The business management systems used in this channel are either custom developed by the large specialty retailers or purchased from business systems providers by small- to medium-sized businesses. We have products and services that support the retail channel.
• | E-commerce Channel. Innovation in the e-commerce channel is taking place across the automotive aftermarket supply chain. Both B2B (wholesale) and B2C (retail) businesses are looking to leverage e-commerce technology to streamline their sales, inventory and delivery operations. The increasing popularity of e-commerce within the aftermarket is encouraging suppliers and OEMs to modify their business models and participate in direct retail sales. It is also attracting traditionally non-automotive participants, such as Amazon and eBay, to the industry. We have products and services that support the e-commerce channel. 

 
In addition to these three primary channels, some aftermarket parts and tires are being distributed through new car dealers. The business management systems used in this channel have unique functionality specific to new car dealerships. We sell a small number of products into the auto service provider side of car dealerships. Also, aftermarket wholesalers of parts and tires provide online purchasing capabilities to some new car dealerships.
 
Product Development
 
Our product development strategy, designed to add value to our customers' businesses through products and services designed to optimize efficiency, consists of the following three key components:

• | Integrating all of our products so that our various software solutions work together seamlessly, thereby eliminating the need to switch between applications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Enhancing our current products and services to support our customers’ changing needs; and 
• | Providing a migration path to our business management systems, reducing a fear that many customers have that changing systems will disrupt business. 

Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing strategy is to acquire customers and retain them by cross-selling and up-selling a range of commercially compelling business management systems, information products and online services.
 
Within the parts, tire and auto service provider segments, each division sells and markets through a combination of field sales and inside sales representatives. We seek to partner with large customers or buying groups and leverage their relationships with their customers or members. Incentive pay is a significant portion of the total compensation package for all sales representatives and sales managers. Outside sales representatives focus primarily on identifying and selling to new customers complemented by an inside sales focus on selling upgrades and new software applications to its installed customer base.
 
Our marketing approach aims to maximize customer retention and secure recurring revenues by leveraging our reputation for satisfying customers and for delivering systems, information and services that improve a customer’s commercial results. We likewise continually aim to enhance the productivity of the field sales team, and to create the cross-selling and up-selling opportunities for our systems, information products and online services.
 
Research and Development
 
We spent $6.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019 on research and development including capitalized software development costs, as compared to $6.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2018.
Patent and Trademark
 
We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have not sought patent protection for any of our products. We have registered the trademark, “MAM Software,” with the US Patent and Trademark office. In addition, we have registered the trademark, “Driving Business Performance,” with the US Patent and Trademark Office.

Customers
 
During the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our total net revenues. Our top ten customers collectively accounted for 23% and 24% of our total net revenues during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Competition
 
In the NA Market, Autopart competes primarily with Epicor Inc. and several other software companies, including Autologue and Fuse 5. VAST competes primarily with ASA, ARI, and MaddenCo, Inc., each of which provides similar products and services as VAST, to the US automotive aftermarket. We are continuously subject to competition from in-house developed custom systems, information products and online services. For example, AutoZone, Inc. and Genuine Parts Company’s NAPA Parts Group each have developed their own business management systems and electronic automotive parts catalogs for their stores and members, although we currently have a partnership agreement with each of these companies to supply their information products through our solutions.
 
In the NA Market, we expect to compete successfully against our competitors using two separate and complementary strategies. First, we will continue to focus on promoting and selling our complete supply chain solutions that provide businesses with easy integration of our business management information systems into their existing supply chain structures. Second, we will continue our strategy of working with those businesses that already manage their own supply chains and information products (catalogs), such as AutoZone, Inc., helping to improve and compliment their systems with our products.
 
Within the auto parts warehouse distribution segment, we will continue to promote our Autopart product, which enables large warehouses with thousands of parts to locate, manage, pack and deliver the parts with ease and efficiency. Our prospective customers are moving towards modern solutions which integrate seamlessly with third-party e-commerce solutions. We have been selling Autopart successfully in the UK Market since 2000; a factor which we believe will help to further expand the presence of this product in NA.
 
The tire segment is comprised of three distinct elements: retail, wholesale and commercial. Within the tire segment and the auto service segment, we focus on market requirements, which we believe will enable us to offer our clients the best solution, regardless of the size of a client’s business. By continually integrating and extending the functionality of our solutions across the entire supply chain, we believe that we will be able to offer existing and potential clients products that suit their present and future needs. Our management believes that our products will present existing and potential clients with the opportunity to move away from their older existing systems, which may restrict their market opportunities, and will permit integration into additional sales channels and reduce the costly maintenance of older systems.
 
The auto parts segment within the auto service space has many competitors who have developed applications for single location auto service shops. Many of these have been developed by parts distributors like NAPA and Advance Auto Parts. While these applications do well in a small single location, they are not widely distributed in the multi-location segment of the auto service business. We believe that our Autowork Online product is highly suited to single location auto service opportunity. The strategy for generating revenue in this sector of the market will be to establish reseller agreements with distributor partners. In addition, we will focus on the multi-location business for which we believe our product VAST is highly suited.
 
The last market in which we plan to compete is the e-commerce space, providing new tools and solutions for this expanding Internet marketplace. Our goal for the OpenWebs™ product is to connect both parts and tire partners together in a real-time environment so that they can perform electronic ordering, gauge inventory levels as well as disseminate information.
 
In the UK Market, we compete primarily with Epicor, Inc. and Kerridge Commercial Systems Limited (“Kerridge”) in the parts sector of the automotive aftermarket. In the tire sector of the UK Market, we compete primarily with CAM Systems, Tyreman and Team Systems. In the vertical sector of the UK Market, we compete with Kerridge, Chatsworth, Blue Rock, OGL, Merlin and Ramtac. We feel that we provide a range of solutions that combine proven concepts with cutting-edge technology that are functional, effective and reliable, and offer solutions that enable businesses to identify and implement new efficiencies and increase existing efficiencies, to our competitive advantage. We believe that these efforts, together with strong post-sales support and ongoing in-depth product and market support, will assist us in generating and maintaining our position within the UK Market.
 
Several large enterprise resource planning and software companies, including Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation and SAP AG, continue to supply Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) and Supply Chain Management (“SCM”) products to medium sized OEMs and suppliers within the automotive market, but to date have not focused strongly on the aftermarket. These companies appear focused on the efficient management of the supply chain and to date do not appear to be looking to supply systems and solutions into the jobber and service segments of the aftermarket. However, there can be no assurance that those companies will not develop or acquire a competitive product or service in the future.
