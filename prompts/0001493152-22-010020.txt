Overview
 
We were originally incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on August 31, 1992. On October 9, 2020, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Wetouch Holding Group Limited, a British Virgin Islands company incorporated on August 14, 2020 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“BVI Wetouch”), and all the shareholders of BVI Wetouch (each a “Shareholder” and collectively the “Shareholders”), to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of BVI Wetouch in exchange for the issuance to the Shareholders an aggregate of 28 million shares of our common stock (the “Reverse Merger”). The Reverse Merger closed on October 9, 2020. Immediately after the closing of the Reverse Merger, we had a total of 31,396,394 issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of the Reverse Merger, BVI Wetouch is now our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we are engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, sales and servicing of medium to large sized projected capacitive touchscreens. We specialize in large-format touchscreens, which are developed and designed for a wide variety of markets and used in the financial terminals, automotive, Point of Sales, gaming, lottery, medical, HMI, and other specialized industries.
 
Our product portfolio comprises medium to large sized projected capacitive touchscreens ranging from 7.0 inch to 42 inch screens. In terms of the structures of touch panels, we offer (i) Glass-Glass (“GG”), primarily used in GPS/car entertainment panels in mid-size and luxury cars, industrial HMI, financial and banking terminals, POS and lottery machines; (ii) Glass-Film-Film (“GFF”), mostly used in high-end GPS and entertainment panels, industrial HMI, financial and banking terminals, lottery and gaming industry; (iii) Plastic-Glass (“PG”), typically adopted by touchscreens in GPS/entertainment panels motor vehicle GPS, smart home, robots and charging stations; and (iv) Glass-Film (“GF”), mostly used in industrial HMI.
 
Maintaining the industry standards for product quality and sustainability is one of our core values. Touchscreens produced by us not only have long life span with low maintenance, but also have strong anti-interference and anti-corrosion solutions, coupled with multi-touch capability and high light-transmittance ratio and stability. As a high technology company, our PRC subsidiary has received certifications from domestic and international institutions, such as ISO9001 Quality Management Systems (QMS) Certification of Registration, ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS) Certification of Registration, and RoHS SGS Certification (Restriction of Hazardous Substance Testing Certification).

We sell our touchscreen products both domestically in China and internationally, covering major areas in China, including but not limited to the eastern, southern, northern and southwest regions of China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Germany. We have established a strong and diversified client base. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our domestic sales accounted for 66.7% and 68.4%, respectively, of our revenues, and our international sales accounted for 33.3% and 31.6%, respectively, of our revenues.
 
Corporate History 
 
We were originally incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on August 31, 1992 as Gulf West Investment Properties, Inc, and were dormant and had no operations for many years.
 
On February 26, 2019, the Eighth Judicial District Court in and for Clark County, Nevada, Case No. A-19-787151-B, appointed Custodian Ventures LLC, an affiliate of David Lazar, as custodian of the Company (the “Custodian”). Mr. Lazar was appointed as the sole officer and director of the Company. On March 11, 2019, 1,714,286 shares of common stock of the Company were issued to the Custodian in consideration for the payment of cash and the issuance of a promissory note by the Custodian to the Company. Effective as of June 11, 2019, the court discharged the Custodian’s duties.

On June 18, 2020, we consummated the transactions contemplated by a Stock Purchase Agreement among the Company, the Custodian, Qixun Samoa and Qihong Samoa (Qixun Samoa and Qixun Samoa are referred to as the “Buyers”). Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Buyers acquired all of the 1,714,286 shares of the Company owned by the Custodian, representing 50.47% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company. The Custodian and the Company agreed to indemnify the Buyers from any liabilities of the Company occurring prior to June 18, 2020, and the promissory note issued by the Custodian to the Company was canceled. Immediately following the closing, David Lazar resigned as the sole officer and director of the Company and Jiaying Cai was appointed as president, secretary and treasurer of the Company and as the sole director.
 
Name Change/Reverse Stock Split
 
Effective September 30, 2020, we changed our name from Gulf West Investment Properties, Inc. to Wetouch Technology Inc. by filing an Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to give effect to a name change. The Amended and Restated Articles also effectuated a reverse split of our authorized, issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a 70 for 1 new basis whereby each 70 shares of outstanding common stock was exchanged for one (1) share of new common stock (the “Reverse Split” and, for avoidance of doubt, all share amounts set forth herein shall be post Reverse Split unless otherwise specified) and, consequently, our authorized common stock increased to 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and our then issued and outstanding common shares decreased from 237,742,066 to 3,396,394 shares, all with a par value of $0.001. All share and per share numbers relating to our common stock prior to the effectiveness of the Reverse Split have been adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Split.
 
As a result of the name change, we changed our trading symbol from “GLFW” to “WETH,” effective November 3, 2020.
 
Acquisition of BVI Wetouch
 
On October 9, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with BVI Wetouch and all of the BVI Wetouch Shareholders to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of BVI Wetouch in exchange for the issuance to the BVI Shareholders an aggregate of 28,000,000 shares of our common stock. In the Reverse Merger, each ordinary share of BVI Wetouch was exchanged for 560 shares of common stock of Wetouch. Immediately after the closing of the Reverse Merger on October 9, 2020, we had a total of 31,396,394 issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of the Reverse Merger, BVI Wetouch is now our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
On October 12, 2020, Guangde Cai was appointed as an additional director and Chairman of the Company.

As BVI Wetouch owns all the outstanding shares of Hong Kong Wetouch, which, in turn, owns all the outstanding shares of Sichuan Wetouch, the Company owns indirectly all the business of Sichuan Wetouch. As a result of the Reverse Merger in which the Company acquired all the outstanding shares of BVI Wetouch, Hong Kong Wetouch and Sichuan Wetouch become our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
Hong Kong Wetouch Technology Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of Hong Kong (“HK Wetouch”), an affiliate of Guangde Cai, our Chairman and Director, was incorporated on December 3, 2020 under the laws of Hong Kong. HK Wetouch was established to own all the outstanding shares of Sichuan Vtouch Technology Co., Ltd., which was incorporated on December 30, 2020 (“Sichuan Vtouch”) in Chengdu, Sichuan, under the laws of The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).
 
On March 12, 2021, BVI Wetouch, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, acquired all the outstanding shares of HK Wetouch from the sole shareholder of HK Wetouch, Guangde Cai, in consideration of the payment of HK$10,000 pursuant to instruments of transfer in accordance with Hong Kong law. As a result of the acquisition, HK Wetouch became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BVI Wetouch. BVI Wetouch owns (i) all the outstanding shares of Hong Kong Wetouch, which, in turn, owns all the outstanding shares of Sichuan Wetouch and (ii) all of the outstanding shares of HK Wetouch, which owns all the shares of Sichaun Vtouch Technology Co., Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of PRC
 
Pursuant to local PRC government guidelines on local environmental issues and the national overall plan, Sichuan Wetouch is under the government-directed relocation order to relocate no later than December 31, 2021 and received compensation accordingly.
 
On March 16, 2021, Sichuan Wetouch entered into an Agreement of Compensation on Demolition (“Compensation Agreement”) with Sichuan Renshou Shigao Tianfu Investment Co., Ltd, a limited company owned by the local government (Sichuan Renshou”), for the withdrawal of our right to use of state-owned land and the demolition of all buildings, facilities and equipment on such land where we maintain our executive offices, research and development facilities and factories at No.29, Third Main Avenue, Shigao Town, Renshou County, Meishan City, Sichuan, China (the “Property”). The Property, all buildings, facilities, equipment and all other appurtenances on the Property are collectively referred to as “Properties”. The Compensation Agreement was executed and delivered as a result of guidelines (the “Guidelines”) published by the local government of with respect to local environmental issues and a national overall plan on Tianfu New District, Meishan City, Sichuan, PRC. In accordance with the Guidelines, a project named “Chaisang River Ecological Wetland Park” is under construction in the areas where the manufacturing facilities and properties of the Company are located. As a result, Sichuan Wetouch must relocate. In consideration for such relocation, the owner of the buildings on the state-owned land will be compensated.
 
In order to minimize the interruption of our business, Sichuan Vtouch entered into a Leaseback Agreement with Sichuan Renshou on March 16, 2021. The Leaseback Agreement entitles us to lease back the Properties commencing from April 1, 2021 until December 31, 2021, at a monthly rent of RMB300,000 (approximately $46,154), which period has been extended to October 31, 2022.
 
On March 18, 2021, Sichuan Wetouch received a total amount of RMB115.2 million (approximately $17.7 million) as the total amount of compensation from Sichuan Renshou, including RMB100.2 million ($15.4 million) based upon the appraised value of the Properties plus an extra 15% relocation bonus of RMB15.0 million ($2.3 million).
 
We are actively searching for an appropriate parcel in Chengdu Medicine City (Technology Park), Wenjiang District, Chengdu for the construction of our new production facilities and office buildings. As of the date of this annual report, we estimate that our capital needs for this acquisition and construction will be approximately RMB170.0 million (approximately $26.2 million), but there is no assurance that the estimated amount is sufficient to achieve our goals. We may need additional financing for our business development. In addition, we expect that this acquisition and construction will be completed prior to December 31, 2021, but there is no assurance and we may need extended time to achieve our business plan. Pursuant to local PRC government guidelines on local environment issues and the national overall plan, Sichuan Wetouch was under the government directed relocation order to relocate no later than December 31, 2021 and was compensated for RMB115.2 million ($17.8 million) from the local government for the withdrawal of the right to use of state-owned land and the demolition of all buildings, facilities, equipment and all other appurtenances on the land.

Effects of COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected our businesses, as well as those of our customers and suppliers. To serve our customers while also providing for the safety of our employees and service providers, we have modified numerous aspects of our logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and after-sale processes. Beginning in Q1 2020, we made numerous process updates across our operations worldwide, and adapted our fulfillment network, to implement employee and customer safety measures, such as enhanced cleaning and physical distancing, personal protective gear, disinfectant spraying, and temperature checks. We will continue to prioritize employee and customer safety and comply with evolving state and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, and communities.
 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our subsidiary Sichuan Wetouch was temporarily shut down from early February 2020 to early March 2020 in accordance with the requirement of the local governments. Our business was negatively impacted and generated lower revenue and net income in 2020. The Company has taken proactive measures to promote products to new customers and entering more regions during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition will depend on the virus’ future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact on the Company’s customers, which are still uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this point of time.

In order to the maintain product safety and a high standard of product quality, the Company implements a strict set of quality control policies and inspection protocols. These policies and protocols are enforced by the Company’s senior management and officers along every step of the production to post-production process. Their management guidelines along with key company quality policies are set out below:
 
The Company has strict production standards in place that governs what constitutes acceptable quality for its products. This ensures that the Company’s products fulfill product certification standards. The production team adheres to the following criteria when making its product standard assessment:
 

Item | Industry Standards | Wetouch’s Standards 
----------------------------+------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reaction time | Less than or equal to 5 milliseconds | Less than or equal to 5 milliseconds 
Surface hardness | 6H | 7H~9H 
Operational temperature | 0~70 degrees Celsius | -30~80 degrees Celsius 
EsD requirement | 6~12KV | 8~15KV 
Transparency | 86% | 88% 
Touch conditions | Normal touch and ordinary conditions | Waterproof and anti-saline solution and anti-corrosion and Anti interference 

 
The products are inspected before they are delivered and sold to our customers. All products must pass the following inspections:
 

● | Cosmetic inspection: conducted under optimum temperatures (20-22 degrees Celsius) and white fluorescent lighting. The product is observed by the naked eye to spot for any defects, scratches and cracks, panel discoloration, opacity, foreign fibers and spots. The Company has in place quantitative standards with respect to each of these areas to determine the level of cosmetic acceptability. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Function tests: all products undergo functionality testing. Touchscreen products are connected electronically via standard cabling systems to computers, to measure and test for effective functionality and to screen for any abnormalities. 
● | Stress testing: all products undergo product stress testing by being subject to humidity, temperature and corrosion stress testing. The products are tested for their functionality in high and low humidity environments as well as in extreme temperatures. The products are inspected to determine whether damage or physical change is caused by exposure to high and low temperatures. 
● | Third party organizations are engaged to conduct independent testing for hazardous substances. The products are also tested for their corrosive resistance to saline solutions. 

 
The Company’s products are produced to order and are marketed directly by its own sales personnel. The Company does not rely on distributors to sell its products.
 
Seasonality of Business
 
There is no significant seasonality in our business.
 
Inventory
 
Inventory consists of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Because a large percentage of the Company’s orders require products to be shipped in the same quarter in which the order was received, and because orders in the inventory may be canceled and delivery schedules may be changed, the Company’s inventory at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period.

Competition
 
The markets for touchscreen products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We believe that the principal competitive factors in its markets are product characteristics such as touch performance, durability, optical clarity and price, as well as supplier characteristics such as quality, service, delivery time and reputation. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, although there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the future.
 
Despite that touchscreen products are highly competitive as a whole, we face fewer competitors, as we produce medium to large size touchscreens which are specially tailored to certain industries, such as industrial HMI, gaming, financing, lottery, automotive, medical, and POS, among others, and require more stable supply and longer guaranty and life span, compared with small size touchscreens, which are characterized by shorter life cycles and guaranty but more demand in quantity.

Industry
 
Since inception, we have positioned ourselves in the professional touchscreen industry. Touchscreen is an input and output device and layered on top of an electronic visual display of an information processing system, allowing individuals to access information and interact with the device simply by touching the device’s screen with a finger or a specialized tool. Accordingly, the ease of use offered by touchscreen-based systems makes the systems well suited both for applications for the general public and for specialized applications for institutional users and trained computer users.
 
Although touchscreen has become mainstream only over the last decade, the concept of a touch-sensitive computer display was developed as early as 1965. Since the introduction of Apple’s iPhone in 2007, touchscreen technology has made rapid inroads into various electronics markets, with a number of other significant companies also incorporating this technology into their products (as opposed to using a mouse, keyboard, keypad or trackball). Viewed today as the most important tool to facilitate interaction between the individual and machine, touchscreen technology is now an integral part of a wide range of computing products.
 
Regulations
 
Overview
 
We operate our business in the PRC under a legal regime consisting of the National People’s Congress, which is the country’s highest legislative body, the State Council, which is the highest authority of the executive branch of the PRC central government, and several ministries and agencies under its authority, including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”), the State Administration for Market Regulation and their respective local offices.
 
This section sets forth a summary of the most significant rules and regulations that affect our business activities in the PRC.

Regulations Relating to Foreign Investment in China
 
On March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress promulgated the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced three existing laws on foreign investments in China, namely, the PRC Equity Joint Venture Law, the PRC Cooperative Joint Venture Law, and the Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The Foreign Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign- and domestic-invested enterprises in China. The Foreign Investment Law establishes the basic framework for the access to, and the promotion, protection, and administration of foreign investments in view of investment protection and fair competition.
 
Pursuant to the Foreign Investment Law, “foreign investment” refers to investment activities directly or indirectly conducted by one or more natural persons, business entities, or otherwise organizations of a foreign country within China, or foreign investors, and the investment activities include the following situations: (i) a foreign investor, individually or collectively with other investors, establishes an Foreign Investment Entity (“FIE”) in China; (ii) a foreign investor acquires stock shares, equity shares, shares in assets, or other similar rights and interests of an enterprise within China; (iii) a foreign investor, individually or collectively with other investors, invests in a new project in China; and (iv) investments in other means as provided by laws, administrative regulations, or the State Council.
 
Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the Ministry of Commerce, or the MOFCOM, and the National Development and Reform Commission, or the NDRC. Restricted and prohibited industries are listed in the Catalogue. The Catalogue sets out a unified basis for the special administrative measures for foreign investment access. Fields not mentioned in the list for foreign investment access, including touchscreen manufacturing, are administered under the principle of equal treatment for domestic and foreign capital.
 
Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally deemed as constituting a “permitted” category. According to the Catalogue, touchscreen manufacturing is classified as industry where foreign investments are permitted.
 
Furthermore, the Foreign Investment Law provides that FIEs established according to the existing laws regulating foreign investment may maintain their structure and corporate governance within five years after the implementation of the Foreign Investment Law.
 
In addition, the Foreign Investment Law also provides several protective rules and principles for foreign investors and their investments in China, including, among others, that local governments must abide by their commitments to the foreign investors; FIEs are allowed to issue stocks and corporate bonds; expropriation or requisition of the investment of foreign investors is prohibited except for special circumstances, in which case statutory procedures must be followed and fair and reasonable compensation must be made in a timely manner; mandatory technology transfer is prohibited; and the capital contributions, profits, capital gains, proceeds out of asset disposal, licensing fees of intellectual property rights, indemnity or compensation legally obtained, or proceeds received upon settlement by foreign investors in China may be freely remitted inward and outward in Renminbi or foreign currencies. Also, foreign investors or FIEs should be imposed legal liabilities for failing to report investment information in accordance with the requirements.
 
On December 26, 2019, the PRC State Council approved the Implementation Rules of Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020. The Implementation Rules of Foreign Investment Law restates certain principles of the Foreign Investment Law and further provides that, among others, (i) if the legal form or the governing structure of an FIE established prior to the effective date of the Foreign Investment Law does not comply with the compulsory provisions of the PRC Company Law or the PRC Partnership Enterprises Law, such FIE should complete amendment registration accordingly no later than January 1, 2025; if it fails to do so, the enterprise registration authority will not process other registration matters of the FIE and may publicize such non-compliance; and (ii) the provisions regarding transfer of equity interests, distribution of profits and remaining assets as stipulated in the joint venture contracts of an existing FIE may survive the Foreign Investment Law during its joint venture term.

Regulations on Environmental Protection
 
Environmental Protection Law
 
The Environmental Protection Law of the PRC, or the Environmental Protection Law, was promulgated and effective on December 26, 1989, and most recently amended on April 24, 2014, which amendments became effective January 1, 2015. This Environmental Protection Law has been formulated for the purpose of protecting and improving both the living environment and the ecological environment, preventing and controlling pollution, other public hazards and safeguarding people’s health.
 
According to the provisions of the Environmental Protection Law, in addition to other relevant laws and regulations of the PRC, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and its local counterparts take charge of administering and supervising said environmental protection matters. Pursuant to the Environmental Protection Law, the environmental impact statement on any construction project must assess the pollution that the project is likely to produce and its impact on the environment, and stipulate preventive and curative measures; the statement shall be submitted to the competent administrative department of environmental protection for approval. Installations for the prevention and control of pollution in construction projects must be designed, built and commissioned together with the principal part of the project.
 
Permission to commence production at or utilize any construction project shall not be granted until its installations for the prevention and control of pollution have been examined and confirmed to meet applicable standards by the appropriate administrative department of environmental protection that examined and approved the environmental impact statement. Installations for the prevention and control of pollution shall not be dismantled or left idle without authorization. Where it is absolutely necessary to dismantle any such installation or leave it idle, prior approval shall be obtained from the competent local administrative department of environmental protection.
 
The Environmental Protection Law makes it clear that the legal liabilities of any violation of said law include warning, fine, rectification within a time limit, compulsory cease operation, compulsory reinstallation of dismantled installations of the prevention and control of pollution or compulsory reinstallation of those left idle, compulsory shutout or closedown, or even criminal punishment.
 
Order on Ecosystem by The Ministry of Ecology and Environment 2019 Classification-based Management on Fixed Pollutant Source
 
Pursuant to the Order on Ecosystem by The Ministry of Ecology and Environment, which was issued on July 28, 2017 and most recently amended on December 20, 2019, The Ministry of Ecology and Environment implements a classification-based management on the environmental impact assessment, or EIA, of pollutants according to pollutant amount and the impact of the pollutants on the environment as below

● | For those pollutant discharge units with large amount of pollutants and significant environmental impacts, the key management on a pollutant discharge permit is required; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | For those pollutant discharge units with small amount of pollutants and small environmental impacts, the simplified management on a pollutant discharge permit is required; and 
● | For those pollutant discharge units with very small amount of pollutants and very small environmental impacts, the pollutant discharge registration form is required. 

 
The touchscreen manufacturing is classified as to fill in a Registration Form. Pursuant to a Statement on Change of Pollutant Discharge Permit to Stationary Pollution Source Registration Form by the local government dated September 1, 2020, the environmental protection system in Renshou County, Sichuan, was changed from permission to registration due to local administrative division change. Therefore, upon submission of all required documentation, we are registered under the new system by filling in Stationary Pollution Source Registration Form.
 
Regulations on Consumer Rights Protection
 
Our business is subject to a variety of consumer protection laws, including the PRC Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Law, which was amended in 2013 and became effective on March 15, 2014. It imposes stringent requirements and obligations on business operators. Failure to comply with these consumer protection laws could subject us to administrative sanctions, such as the issuance of a warning, confiscation of illegal income, imposition of fines, an order to cease business operations, revocation of business licenses, and potential civil or criminal liabilities.

As of the date of this prospectus, we are not aware of any warning, investigations, prosecutions, disputes, claims or other proceedings in respect of customer rights protection, nor have we been punished or can foresee any punishment to be made by any government authorities of the PRC.
 
Regulations on Intellectual Property Rights
 
Regulations on Trademark
 
Trademarks are protected by the PRC Trademark Law adopted in 1982 and subsequently amended as well as the Implementation Regulations for the Trademark Law of the PRC in 2002 and subsequently amended in 2014. The Trademark Office under the SAIC handles trademark registrations. Trademarks can be registered for a term of ten years and can be extended for another ten years if requested upon expiry of the first or any renewed ten-year term. The PRC Trademark Law has adopted a “first-to-file” principle with respect to trademark registration. Where a trademark for which a registration application has been made is identical or similar to another trademark which has already been registered or been subject to a preliminary examination and approval for use on the same type of or similar commodities or services, the application for such trademark registration may be rejected. Any person applying for the registration of a trademark may not prejudice the existing right first obtained by others, nor may any person register in advance a trademark that has already been used by another party and has already gained a “sufficient degree of reputation” through such another party’s use. Trademark license agreements must be filed with the Trademark Office or its regional offices. As of September 30, 2021, we had 1 registered trademark in China.
Regulations on Patent Law
 
According to the PRC Patent Law (2008 Revision), the State Intellectual Property Office is responsible for administering patent law in China. The patent administration departments of the provincial, autonomous region, or municipal governments are responsible for administering patent law within their respective jurisdictions. The PRC patent system adopts a first-to-file principle, which means that when more than one person files different patent applications for the same invention, only the person who files the application first is entitled to obtain a patent of the invention. To be patentable, an invention or a utility model must meet three criteria: novelty, inventiveness, and practicability. A patent is valid for twenty years in the case of an invention and ten years in the case of utility models and designs. As of the date of this prospectus, we had 10 registered patents under our former PRC subsidiary Sichuan Wetouch, which we are in the process of assigning to our PRC subsidiary Sichuan Vtouch and 4 pending patents in China under our PRC subsidiary Sichuan Vtouch.
Regulations on Foreign Exchange
 
General Administration of Foreign Exchange
 
Under the PRC Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated on January 29, 1996 and most recently amended on August 5, 2008 and various regulations issued by the SAFE, and other relevant PRC government authorities, Renminbi is convertible into other currencies for current account items, such as trade-related receipts and payments and payment of interest and dividends. The conversion of Renminbi into other currencies and remittance of the converted foreign currency outside China for capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans, and repatriation of investment, requires the prior approval from the SAFE or its local office.
 
Payments for transactions that take place in China must be made in Renminbi. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies may not repatriate foreign currency payments received from abroad or retain the same abroad. FIEs may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks under the current account items subject to a cap set by the SAFE or its local branch. Foreign exchange proceeds under the current accounts may be either retained or sold to a financial institution engaged in settlement and sale of foreign exchange pursuant to relevant SAFE rules and regulations. For foreign exchange proceeds under the capital accounts, approval from the SAFE is generally required for the retention or sale of such proceeds to a financial institution engaged in settlement and sale of foreign exchange.

Pursuant to the Circular of the SAFE on Notice of State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Improvements and Adjustments to Foreign Exchange Control Policies for Direct Investment, which was promulgated on November 19, 2012, became effective on December 17, 2012, and was further amended on May 4, 2015, October 10, 2018, and December 30, 2019, approval of the SAFE is not required for opening a foreign exchange account and depositing foreign exchange into the accounts relating to the direct investments. This circular also simplifies foreign exchange-related registration required for foreign investors to acquire equity interests of PRC companies and further improve the administration on foreign exchange settlement for FIEs.
 
The Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Simplifying and Improving the Foreign Exchange Management Policies for Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 13, which became effective on June 1, 2015 and was amended on December 30, 2019, cancels the administrative approvals of foreign exchange registration of direct domestic investment and direct overseas investment and simplifies the procedure of foreign exchange-related registration. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 13, investors should register with banks for direct domestic investment and direct overseas investment.
 
The Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, which was promulgated on March 30, 2015, became effective on June 1, 2015, and was amended on December 30, 2019, provides that an FIE may, according to its actual business needs, settle with a bank the portion of the foreign exchange capital in its capital account for which the relevant foreign exchange administration has confirmed monetary capital contribution rights and interests (or for which the bank has registered the injection of the monetary capital contribution into the account). Pursuant to this circular, for the time being, FIEs are allowed to settle 100% of their foreign exchange capital on a discretionary basis; an FIE should truthfully use its capital for its own operational purposes within the scope of its business; where an ordinary FIE makes domestic equity investment with the amount of foreign exchanges settled, the FIE must first go through domestic re-investment registration and open a corresponding account for foreign exchange settlement pending payment with the foreign exchange administration or the bank at the place where it is registered.
 
The Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Policies for Reforming and Regulating the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement under the Capital Account, which was promulgated and became effective on June 9, 2016, provides that enterprises registered in China may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency into Renminbi on a self-discretionary basis. This circular also provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange under capital account items (including, but not limited to, foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on a self-discretionary basis, which applies to all enterprises registered in China.
 
On January 26, 2017, SAFE promulgated the Notice of State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Improving the Check of Authenticity and Compliance to further Promote Foreign Exchange Control, which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to the outbound remittance of profit from domestic entities to offshore entities, including: (i) banks should check board resolutions regarding profit distribution, the original version of tax filing records, and audited financial statements pursuant to the principle of genuine transactions; and (ii) domestic entities should hold income to account for previous years’ losses before remitting the profits. Moreover, pursuant to this circular, domestic entities should make detailed explanations of the sources of capital and utilization arrangements, and provide board resolutions, contracts, and other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment.
 
On October 25, 2019, the SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Facilitation of Cross-border Trade and Investment, which, among other things, allows all FIEs to use Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments in China, as long as the equity investment is genuine, does not violate applicable laws, and complies with the negative list on foreign investment. However, since this circular is newly promulgated, it is unclear how the SAFE and competent banks will carry it out in practice.
 
According to the Regulations of the PRC on Administration of Company Registration, which were promulgated by the State Council on June 24, 1994, became effective on July 1, 1994, and were amended on February 6, 2016, and other laws and regulations governing FIEs and company registrations, the establishment of an FIE and any capital increase and other major changes in an FIE should be registered with the State Administration for Market Regulation or its local counterparts and filed via the enterprise registration system.

Pursuant to SAFE Circular 13 and other laws and regulations relating to foreign exchange, when setting up a new FIE, the enterprise should register with the bank located at its registered place after obtaining the business license, and if there is any change in capital or other changes relating to the basic information of the FIE, including, without limitation, any increase in its registered capital or total investment, the FIE must register such changes with the bank located at its registered place after obtaining approval from or completing the filing with relevant authorities. Pursuant to the relevant foreign exchange laws and regulations, such foreign exchange registration with the banks will typically take less than four weeks upon the acceptance of the registration application.
 
Based on the foregoing, if we intend to provide funding to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries through capital injection at or after their establishment, we must register the establishment of and any follow-on capital increase in our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries with the State Administration for Market Regulation or its local counterparts, file such via the enterprise registration system, and register such with the local banks for the foreign exchange related matters.
 
Regulations on Offshore Financing
 
Under the Circular of the SAFE on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Round-Trip Investment by Domestic Residents via Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, effective on July 4, 2014, PRC residents are required to register with the local SAFE branch prior to the establishment or control of an offshore special purpose vehicle, which is defined as an offshore enterprise directly established or indirectly controlled by PRC residents for investment and financing purposes, with the enterprise assets or interests PRC residents hold in China or overseas. The term “control” means to obtain the operation rights, right to proceeds, or decision-making power of a special purpose vehicle through acquisition, trust, holding shares on behalf of others, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds, or other means. At the same time, the SAFE has issued the Operation Guidance for the Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration over Round-Trip Investment regarding the procedures for SAFE registration under SAFE Circular 37, which became effective on July 4, 2014 as an attachment of SAFE Circular 37.
 
The PRC residents are also required to amend the registration or filing with the local SAFE branch any material change in the offshore company, such as any change of basic information (including change of such PRC residents, name and operation term), increase or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or merger or divisions. On February 28, 2015, SAFE promulgated the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13, which became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to SAFE Notice 13, instead of applying for approvals regarding foreign exchange registrations of foreign direct investment and overseas direct investment from SAFE as required under current laws, entities and individuals will be required to apply for such foreign exchange registrations, including those required under the SAFE Circular 37, from qualified banks. The qualified banks, under the supervision of SAFE, will directly examine the applications and conduct the registration.
 
Failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in the SAFE Circular 37, or making misrepresentation on or failure to disclose controllers of foreign-invested enterprise that is established through round-trip investment, may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including the increase of its registered capital, the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate and the capital inflow from the offshore entities, and may also subject relevant PRC residents to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. PRC residents who directly or indirectly hold any shares in our company from time to time are required to register with SAFE in connection with their investments in us. We have requested PRC residents holding direct or indirect interest in our company to our knowledge to make the necessary applications, filings and amendments as required under the SAFE Circular 37 and other related rules.
 
As of the date of this prospectus, the PRC residents have either not completed, or have not applied for, foreign exchange registration under the SAFE Circular 37 and other related rules. Although they are either in the process of making foreign exchange registration or plan to make foreign exchange registrations, they may still be faced with the above possible fines in accordance with the PRC Laws.

Regulations on Dividend Distribution
 
The principal laws and regulations regulating the distribution of dividends by FIEs in China include the PRC Company Law, as amended in 2004, 2005, 2013, and 2018, and the 2019 PRC Foreign Investment Law and its Implementation Rules. Under the current regulatory regime in China, FIEs in China may pay dividends only out of their retained earnings, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. A PRC company is required to set aside as statutory reserve funds at least 10% of its after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserve funds reaches 50% of its registered capital unless laws regarding foreign investment provide otherwise. A PRC company cannot distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
 
We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not rely on an investment in our common stock as a source for any future dividend income.
 
Regulation on M&A Rules
 
In August 2006, six PRC governmental agencies jointly promulgated the Provisions on Foreign-funded Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises, or the M&A Rule, as most recently amended in 2009. The M&A Rule requires offshore special purpose vehicles formed to pursue overseas listing of equity interests in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals to obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on any stock exchange overseas.
 
The application of the M&A Rules remains unclear. We believe that, to our understanding, based on the current PRC laws, rules and regulations, prior approval from the CSRC is not required under the M&A Rules for the listing and trading of our shares because (i) the CSRC currently has not issued any definitive rule or interpretation concerning whether offerings under the document are subject to the M&A Rules; (ii) the PRC subsidiary is directly established as wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and the Company has not acquired any equity interest or assets of a PRC domestic company owned by PRC companies or individuals as defined under the M&A Rules that are the Company’s beneficial owners after the effective date of the M&A Rules. However, uncertainties still exist as to how the M&A Rules will be interpreted and implemented and our opinions summarized above are subject to any new laws, rules and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M&A Rules.
 
Regulations on Taxation
 
Enterprise Income Tax
 
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress promulgated the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which was amended on February 24, 2017 and December 29, 2018. On December 6, 2007, the State Council enacted the Regulations for the Implementation of the Enterprise Income Tax Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended on April 23, 2019. Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law and the relevant implementation regulations, both resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises are subject to tax in China. Resident enterprises are defined as enterprises that are established in China in accordance with PRC laws, or that are established in accordance with the laws of foreign countries but are actually or in effect controlled from within China. Non-resident enterprises are defined as enterprises that are organized under the laws of foreign countries and whose actual management is conducted outside China, but have established institutions or premises in China, or have no such established institutions or premises but have income generated from inside China. Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law and relevant implementing regulations, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 25% is applied. However, if non-resident enterprises have not formed permanent establishments or premises in China, or if they have formed permanent establishment or premises in China but there is no actual relationship between the relevant income derived in China and the established institutions or premises set up by them, enterprise income tax is set at the rate of 10% with respect to their income sourced from inside the PRC.

Value-Added Tax
 
The PRC Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Tax were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, which became effective on January 1, 1994 and were subsequently amended from time to time. The Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the PRC Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Tax (2011 Revision) was promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on December 25, 1993 and subsequently amended on December 15, 2008 and October 28, 2011. On November 19, 2017, the State Council promulgated the Decisions on Abolishing the PRC Provisional Regulations on Business Tax and Amending the PRC Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Tax. Pursuant to these regulations, rules and decisions, all enterprises and individuals engaged in sale of goods, provision of processing, repair, and replacement services, sales of services, intangible assets, real property, and the importation of goods within the PRC territory are VAT taxpayers. On March 21, 2019, the Ministry of Finance, the SAT, and the General Administration of Customs jointly issued the Announcement on Relevant Policies on Deepen the Reform of Value-Added Tax. Sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of VAT. The VAT is based on gross sales price and VAT rates range up to 17%, starting from May 1, 2018, VAT rate was lowered to 16%, and starting from April 1, 2019, VAT rate was further lowered to 13%.
 
Dividend Withholding Tax
 
The Enterprise Income Tax Law provides that since January 1, 2008, an income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to dividends declared to non-PRC resident investors that do not have an establishment or place of business in China, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within China.
 
Pursuant to the Arrangement Between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, and other applicable PRC laws, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have met the relevant conditions and requirements under this arrangement and other applicable laws, the 10% withholding tax on the dividends the Hong Kong resident enterprise receives from a PRC resident enterprise may be reduced to 5%. However, based on the Circular on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties issued on February 20, 2009, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretions, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment. Pursuant to the Circular on Several Questions regarding the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties, which was issued on February 3, 2018 by the SAT and became effective on April 1, 2018, when determining the applicant’s status as the “beneficial owner” regarding tax treatments in connection with dividends, interests, or royalties in the tax treaties, several factors, including, without limitation, whether the applicant is obligated to pay more than 50% of his or her income in twelve months to residents in third country or region, whether the business operated by the applicant constitutes the actual business activities, and whether the counterparty country or region to the tax treaties does not levy any tax or grant any tax exemption on relevant incomes or levy tax at an extremely low rate, will be taken into account, and such factors will be analyzed according to the actual circumstances of the specific cases. This circular further provides that an applicant who intends to prove his or her status as the “beneficial owner” must submit the relevant documents to the relevant tax bureau pursuant to the Announcement on Issuing the Measures for the Administration of Non-Resident Taxpayers’ Enjoyment of the Treatment under Tax Agreements.
 
Regulations on Employment Laws
 
In accordance with the PRC National Labor Law, which became effective in January 1995 and amended from time to time, and the PRC Labor Contract Law, which became effective in January 2008, as amended subsequently, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees in order to establish an employment relationship. All employers must compensate their employees equal to at least the local minimum wage standards. All employers are required to establish a system for labor safety and sanitation, strictly abide by state rules and standards and provide employees with appropriate workplace safety training. In addition, employers in China are obliged to pay contributions to the social insurance plan and the housing fund plan for employees.
