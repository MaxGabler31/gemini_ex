ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
SRC Energy Inc. ("we," "us," "our," "SRC," or the "Company"), a Colorado corporation formed in 2005, is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and NGLs in the D-J Basin, which we believe to be one of the premier, liquids-rich oil and natural gas resource plays in the United States. It contains hydrocarbon-bearing deposits in several formations, including the Niobrara, Codell, Greenhorn, Shannon, Sussex, J-Sand, and D-Sand. The area has produced oil and natural gas for over fifty years and benefits from established infrastructure, long reserve life, and multiple service providers.
Our oil and natural gas activities are focused in the Wattenberg Field, in Weld County, Colorado, an area that covers the western flank of the D-J Basin. Currently, we are focused on the horizontal development of the Codell formation as well as the three benches of the Niobrara formation, which are all characterized by relatively high liquids content.
In order to maintain operational focus while preserving developmental flexibility, we strive to attain operational control of a majority of the wells in which we have a working interest. We currently operate approximately 82% of our proved developed reserves and anticipate operating a majority of our future net drilling locations. Additionally, our current development plan anticipates that all of our future activities will be concentrated in the Wattenberg Field.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to execute our plans for growth through development of our existing oil and gas properties and strategic acquisitions of leasehold and producing properties. The Company's consolidated core position in the Wattenberg Field is approximately 86,200 net acres.   This contiguous footprint creates further opportunities to drive operational efficiencies with over 1,600 identified gross well locations with predominantly mid- and long-lateral design.
As of December 31, 2018, we are the operator of 1,030 gross (985 net) producing wells, of which 406 gross (384 net) are Codell or Niobrara horizontal wells. The Company has also participated as a non-operator in 497 gross (115 net) producing wells. As we develop our acreage through horizontal drilling, we have an active program for plugging and reclaiming the vast majority of the operated vertical wellbores. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we reclaimed 203 wells and returned the associated surface acreage to the property owners.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our average net daily production was 50,543 BOED, 34,194 BOED, and 11,670 BOED, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, over 92% of our daily operated production was from horizontal wells.
Strategy
Our primary objective is to enhance shareholder value by increasing our net asset value, net reserves, and cash flow through development, exploitation, and acquisitions of oil and gas properties. We intend to follow a balanced risk strategy by allocating capital expenditures to lower risk development and exploitation activities. Key elements of our business strategy include the following:

• | Concentrate on our existing core area in the D-J Basin, where we have significant operating experience. All of our current wells and our proved undeveloped acreage are located in the Wattenberg Field, and we seek to acquire developed and undeveloped oil and gas properties in the same contiguous area. Focusing our operations in this area leverages our management, technical, and operational experience in the basin. 


• | Maximize shareholder value and maintain financial flexibility by limiting the need for external capital. We seek to align our capital expenditures with our cash flows by adjusting our operating activities depending on commodity prices and infrastructure capacity. We strive to be a cost-efficient operator and to maintain a relatively low utilization of debt, which allows sufficient financial capacity to pursue strategic acquisitions. 


• | Develop and exploit existing oil and gas properties. A principal growth strategy has been to develop and exploit our properties to add reserves. In the Wattenberg Field, we target three benches of the Niobrara formation as well as the Codell formation for horizontal drilling and production. We believe horizontal drilling is the safest and most efficient and economical way to recover the potential hydrocarbons and consider the Wattenberg Field to be relatively low-risk because information gained from the large number of existing wells can be applied to potential future wells. There is enough similarity between wells in the Wattenberg Field that the exploitation process is generally repeatable.

• | Use the latest technology to maximize returns and improve hydrocarbon recovery. Our development objective for individual well optimization is to primarily drill and complete wells with lateral lengths of 7,000' to 10,000'. Utilizing petrophysical and seismic data, a 3-D model is developed for each leasehold section to assist in determining optimal wellbore placement, well spacing, and stimulation design. This process is augmented with formation-specific drilling and completion execution designs, coupled with production results, to implement a continuous improvement philosophy in optimizing the value per acre of our leasehold throughout our development program. 


• | Control and reduce emissions from our production facilities. We place high importance on achieving compliance with all applicable air quality rules and regulations and further reducing emissions continues to be a top priority. To minimize emissions, we employ best management practices such as using available direct pipeline take-away access and pneumatic actuated instrument devices and by working with suppliers to deploy diesel engines that meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Tier 4 standard. We control emissions and minimize flaring of gas during the drilling and completion process. We use additional vapor recovery equipment during production for further emissions reduction. We continue to evolve the design of our production facilities to produce oil and natural gas with fewer air emissions, including those emissions for which there are public health standards (e.g. ozone and particulate matter). 


• | Operate in a safe manner and work in partnership with our surrounding stakeholders. While our scale of operations has increased significantly, we continue to focus on maintaining a safe workplace for our employees and contractors. Further, as technology for resource development has advanced, we seek to utilize best industry practices to meet or exceed regulatory requirements while reducing our impacts on neighboring communities. Such practices include building our infrastructure out ahead of operations to minimize traffic, working with our service providers to minimize dust and lighting issues, and constructing sound walls to minimize noise. We value our positive relationship with local governing entities and the communities in which we operate and seek to continually achieve a status of operator of choice. 


• | Retain control over the operation of a substantial portion of our production. As operator of a majority of our wells and undeveloped acreage, we control the timing and selection of new wells to be drilled. This allows us to modify our capital spending as our financial resources and underlying lease terms allow and market conditions permit. Our high degree of operational control, as well as our focus on operating efficiencies that provide short return on investment cycle times, is central to our operating strategy. 


• | Acquire and develop assets near established infrastructure. We target acquisitions of contiguous acreage to focus our development plans on areas where technically-capable, financially-stable midstream companies have existing assets and plans for additional investment. We work collaboratively with these companies to proactively identify expansion opportunities that complement our development plans enabling the use of gathering pipelines which reduces truck traffic. 

Competitive Strengths

We believe that we are positioned to successfully execute our business strategy because of the following competitive strengths:

• | Core acreage position in the Wattenberg Field. Wells in our core properties in the Wattenberg Field generally exhibit high liquids content, and those properties are generally prospective for Niobrara A, B, and C bench and Codell development. We believe that these factors lead to a high success rate and attractive EURs per acres of leasehold, per unit capital and operating costs, and rates of return. Increased well density within the Codell and Niobrara formations, as well as our acquisition efforts and organic leasing efforts within the core Wattenberg Field, have added to our multi-year drilling inventory. Our core position is situated in an area where there is extensive infrastructure that continues to be expanded. 


• | Financial flexibility. Our capital structure, along with our high degree of operational control, continues to provide us with significant financial flexibility. Our modest debt level has enabled us to make capital decisions with limited restrictions imposed by debt covenants, lender oversight, and/or mandatory repayment schedules. Additionally, as the operator of substantially all of our anticipated future drilling locations per our December 31, 2018 reserve report, we control the timing and selection of drilling locations as well as completion schedules. This allows us to modify our capital spending program depending on financial resources, leasehold requirements, infrastructure capacity, and market conditions. 


• | Management experience. Members of our key management team possess multiple years of experience in oil and gas exploration and production in multiple resource plays including the Wattenberg Field.

• | Balanced oil and natural gas reserves and production. At December 31, 2018, approximately 77% of our total gross revenues were oil and condensate, 12% were natural gas, and 11% were natural gas liquids. We believe that this balanced commodity mix will provide diversification of sources of cash flow. 


• | Focus on efficiency and cost control. We have continued to demonstrate our ability to drill wells in a safe and cost-efficient way and to successfully integrate acquired assets without incurring significant increases in overhead. 


• | Safe workplace and reduced impact on surrounding areas. Our employees and contractors are important to us, so we strive to maintain a safety-first approach in our operations. Likewise, we seek to incorporate current technologies to meet regulatory requirements while reducing our impact on the environment and neighboring communities. Toward this effort, modern drilling and completion techniques allow us to concentrate our operations on a reduced number of surface locations. As the new locations are developed, we have decreased the overall number of wells by plugging and reclaiming older vertical wells, allowing us to return those sites to surface owners. 

Properties
As of December 31, 2018, our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves, as prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. ("Ryder Scott"), an independent reserve engineering firm, were 88.0 MMBbls of oil and condensate, 771.9 Bcf of natural gas, and 89.1 MMBbls of natural gas liquids. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 95,200 gross and 86,200 net acres under lease in the Wattenberg Field.
We currently operate over 82% of our proved producing reserves, and all of our drilling and completion expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2018 were focused on the Wattenberg Field. All of our drilling and completion expenditures for the 2019 calendar year are anticipated to be focused on the Wattenberg Field. A high degree of operational and capital control gives us both operational focus and development flexibility to maximize returns on our leasehold position.
2018 Significant Developments
Acquisitions and Trades
In September 2018, the Company completed the second closing contemplated by the purchase and sale agreement (the "GCII Agreement") relating to our 2017 acquisition of approximately 30,200 net acres in the Greeley-Crescent development area in Weld County, Colorado (the "GCII Acquisition"). At the second closing, we acquired the operated vertical and horizontal wells. The effective date for this second closing was September 1, 2018. The purchase and sale agreement for the GCII Acquisition was signed in November 2017, and the first closing was completed in December 2017.The total purchase price for the second closing was $96.9 million, composed of cash of $64.2 million and assumed liabilities of $32.7 million. The assumed liabilities included $25.8 million for asset retirement obligations.
In August 2018, the Company completed the purchase of leasehold acreage and associated non-operated production for $37.2 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities, for a total purchase price of $37.5 million. The acreage increased our working interest in existing operations and planned wells.
In September and November 2018, we completed two trades with other parties totaling approximately 4,700 net acres. These transactions further enhance the contiguous nature of the Company's acreage position.
Revolving Credit Facility
We continue to maintain a borrowing arrangement with our bank syndicate (sometimes referred to as the "Revolver") to provide us with liquidity that can be used to develop oil and gas properties, acquire new oil and gas properties, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, the terms of the Revolver provided for up to $1.5 billion in borrowings, an aggregate elected commitment of $500 million, and a borrowing base limitation of $650 million. The borrowing base is subject to adjustments based upon a borrowing base calculation, which is re-determined semi-annually using updated reserve reports. The Revolver is collateralized by certain of our assets, including substantially all of our producing wells and developed oil and gas leases, and bears a variable interest rate on borrowings with the effective rate varying with utilization.

Major Customers
We sell our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs to various purchasers under multiple contractual arrangements. For crude oil, we have several arrangements, ranging from month-to-month to long-term commitments. Notably, we have secured contracts with oil purchasers who transport oil via pipelines. Under these contracts, we entered into delivery commitments covering a portion of our anticipated future production over the next two to three years. Our natural gas is sold under contracts with two midstream gas gathering and processing companies. We are working with our midstream providers in an effort to expand available gas gathering and processing and oil takeaway capacity. See further discussion in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2018, five of our customers account for more than 10% of our revenues. Given the liquidity in the market, we believe that the loss of any purchaser or the aggregate loss of several customers could be managed by selling to alternative purchasers.
Oil and Gas Properties, Wells, Operations, and Acreage

We believe that the title to our oil and gas properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject to such exceptions which, in our opinion, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of such properties. Our properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following:

• | royalties and other burdens and obligations, expressed or implied, under oil and gas leases;


• | overriding royalties and other burdens created by us or our predecessors in title;


• | a variety of contractual obligations arising under operating agreements, joint use agreements, production sales contracts, and other agreements that may affect the properties or title thereto;


• | back-ins and reversionary interests existing as a result of pooling under state orders;


• | liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors, and contractual liens under operating agreements and the Revolver;


• | pooling, unitization and communitization agreements, declarations, and orders; and


• | easements, restrictions, rights-of-way, and other matters that commonly affect property.

To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect our rights to production revenues, they have been taken into account in calculating our net revenue interests and in estimating the size and value of our reserves. We believe that the burdens and obligations affecting our properties are customary in the industry for properties of the kind that we own.
The following table shows, as of December 31, 2018, our producing wells, developed acreage, and undeveloped acreage:

 | Productive Wells | Developed Acreage 2 | | Undeveloped Acreage 1,2
Field | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net
Wattenberg | 1,523 | | 1,098 | | 23,900 | | 21,700 | | 71,300 | 64,500

  1    Undeveloped acreage includes leasehold interests on which wells have not been horizontally drilled or completed to the point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether the leasehold interest is classified as containing proved undeveloped reserves.
  2    In addition to our acreage in the Wattenberg Field, we also have non-core leasehold in other areas of Colorado, Kansas, and southwest Nebraska approximating 181,200 gross and 159,500 net acres. As of December 31, 2018, this leasehold has no unproved carrying value, and all associated costs are subject to depletion within the full cost pool.

The following table shows, as of December 31, 2018, the status of our gross undeveloped acreage within the Wattenberg Field:

Field | Held by Production | Not Held by Production
Wattenberg | 68,200 | | 3,100

Leases that are held by production generally remain in force so long as oil or natural gas is produced from the well on the particular lease.  Leased acres which are not held by production will expire pursuant to the terms of the lease, provided that the lease may permit us to extend it by making annual rental payments until production is established, at which time the lease will
generally be considered to be held by production.

The following table shows the calendar years during which our leases in the Wattenberg Field not currently held by production will expire unless a productive oil or natural gas well is drilled on the lease or the lease is renewed.

Oil and Natural Gas Reserves

Our estimated proved reserve quantities increased by 35% from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.  At December 31, 2018, we had estimated proved reserves of 88.0 MMBbls of oil and condensate, 771.9 Bcf of natural gas, and 89.1 MMBbls of natural gas liquids. The estimated standardized measure of future net cash flow from our reserves at December 31, 2018 was $2.7 billion, and the estimated PV-10 value of our reserves at that date was $3.2 billion. PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure that reflects the present value, discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves. We present a reconciliation of PV-10 value to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows in Item 7 under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." The PV-10 value as of December 31, 2018 increased compared to December 31, 2017 by $1.4 billion. The increase in estimated proved reserve quantities and PV-10 value is primarily due to extensions resulting in new proved reserves, increased pricing for oil and NGLs during 2018, and revisions resulting in probable reserves being recognized as proved reserves.
Ryder Scott prepared the estimates of our proved reserves, future production, and income attributable to our leasehold interests as of December 31, 2018.  Ryder Scott is an independent petroleum engineering firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services worldwide for over seventy years.  The estimates of proved reserves, future production, and income attributable to certain leasehold and royalty interests are based on technical analyses conducted by teams of geoscientists and engineers employed at Ryder Scott.  The office of Ryder Scott that prepared our reserves estimates is registered in the State of Texas (License #F-1580).  Ryder Scott prepared our reserve estimate based upon a review of property interests being appraised, historical production, lease operating expenses, price differentials, authorizations for expenditure, and geological and geophysical data.

The report of Ryder Scott dated January 23, 2019, which contains further discussions of the reserve estimates and evaluations prepared by Ryder Scott, as well as the qualifications of Ryder Scott’s technical personnel responsible for overseeing such estimates and evaluations, is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our reserves technical team, which consists of our Reservoir Engineering Manager, VP of Exploration, Chief Operations Officer, and Chief Development Officer, oversaw the preparation of the reserve estimates by Ryder Scott to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data prior to and after submission.  Our technical team has multiple years of experience in oil and gas exploration and development.

Our proved reserves include only those amounts which we reasonably expect to recover in the future from known oil and natural gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, at current prices and costs, under existing regulatory practices, and with existing technology.  Accordingly, any changes in prices, operating and development costs, regulations, technology, or other factors could significantly increase or decrease estimates of proved reserves.

Estimates of volumes of proved reserves at year end are presented in barrels for oil, Mcf for natural gas, and barrels for NGL at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the natural gas reserves are located.

The proved reserves attributable to producing wells and/or reservoirs were estimated by performance methods.  These performance methods include decline curve analysis, which incorporate extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through December 31, 2018 in those cases where this data was considered to be definitive.  The data used in this analysis was obtained from public sources and was considered sufficient for calculating producing reserves. The undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method.  The analogy method uses pertinent well data obtained from public sources that was available through December 31, 2018.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the combined effect of our drilling, acquisition, and participation activities and increased commodity prices generated an increase in projected future cash inflow from proved reserves of $3.3 billion and 
9

an increase in future pre-tax net cash flow of $2.2 billion from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.  During the same period, our PV-10 from proved reserves increased by $1.4 billion.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $720.3 million related to the acquisition and development of proved reserves. 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the combined effect of our drilling, acquisition, and participation activities and increased commodity prices generated an increase in projected future cash inflow from proved reserves of $3.3 billion and an increase in future pre-tax net cash flow of $2.2 billion from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.  During the same period, our PV-10 from proved reserves increased by $1.3 billion.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $600.0 million related to the acquisition and development of proved reserves. 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the combined effect of our drilling, acquisition, and participation activities, partially offset by declining commodity prices generated an increase in projected future cash inflow from proved reserves of $470.1 million and an increase in future pre-tax net cash flow of $44.0 million from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016.  During the same period, our PV-10 from proved reserves increased by $38.2 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $283.3 million related to the acquisition and development of proved reserves. 
In general, the volume of production from our oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted.  Unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities, or both, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced.  Accordingly, volumes generated from our future activities are highly dependent upon our success in acquiring or finding additional reserves, and the costs incurred in doing so.

At December 31, 2018, our proved undeveloped reserves were 178,192 MBOE. During 2018, our acquisitions led to an increase of 12,207 MBOE in proved undeveloped reserves.  Offsetting the 27,627 MBOE of prior year proved undeveloped reserves that were converted to proved developed reserves, we added 31,486 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves, primarily as a result of extending our development plan by a year due to the passage of time. Consistent with prior years, we limited our undeveloped locations related to horizontal wells to be drilled within this three-year horizon.
During the year end December 31, 2018, we converted 27,627 MBOE, or 20%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2017 into proved developed reserves, requiring $268.8 million of drilling and completion capital expenditures. All proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2018 are expected to be converted to proved producing within three years and within five years of their initial booking.  Based on our current drilling plans for the next three years, we expect to allocate 
10

all funds to developmental drilling in areas of established production where ongoing and planned midstream infrastructure buildout continues. None of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2018 have been in this category for more than five years.
At December 31, 2017, our proved undeveloped reserves were 139,315 MBOE. During 2017, the GCII Acquisition, along with other minor acquisitions, led to an increase of 34,867 MBOE in proved undeveloped reserves.  This increase was partially offset by a decrease of 235 MBOE as a result of divestitures. Offsetting the 23,781 MBOE of prior year proved undeveloped reserves that were converted to proved developed reserves, we added 46,913 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves, primarily as a result of extending our development plan by a year due to the passage of time and the addition of a third rig for the second and third years of our development plan. Further, due to a better commodity market environment, our increase in expected drilling activity positively affected our proved undeveloped reserves.  During the year end December 31, 2017, we converted 23,781 MBOE, or 32%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2016 into proved developed reserves, requiring $185.2 million of drilling and completion capital expenditures.
At December 31, 2016, our proved undeveloped reserves were 75,489 MBOE. During 2016, the Company's acquisition of approximately 33,100 net acres in the Greeley-Crescent development area in Weld County, Colorado ("GC Acquisition"),  along with other minor acquisitions, led to an increase of 50,530 MBOE in proved undeveloped reserves.  These acquisitions allowed for the creation of spacing units with higher working interests, opportunities to drill longer laterals, and increased focus on our development program in the core Wattenberg area. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of 12,144 MBOE as a result of the GC Acquisition and related changes to our development plan that resulted in the removal of certain legacy PUD locations from the three-year drilling plan. This significant change to our development plan resulted in many of the legacy proved undeveloped locations being removed from the development plan. Consequently, only 806 MBOE, or 2%, of prior year proved undeveloped reserves were converted to proved developed reserves during 2016. We also developed 3,217 MBOE of acquired proved undeveloped reserves during the year, and we drilled 5.4 net exploratory wells. Further, due to a better commodity market environment, our increase in expected drilling activity positively affected our proved undeveloped reserves.  While our 2015 reserves estimate assumed no rig initially then an increase to two rigs during the first year of the then-applicable development plan, our 2016 reserves estimate assumed two rigs working continually throughout the three-year plan period.

Competition and Marketing
We are faced with strong competition from many other companies and individuals engaged in the oil and gas business, many of which are very large, well-established energy companies with substantial capabilities and established earnings records.  We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring oil and gas prospects since we must compete with these companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs.  It is nearly impossible to estimate the number of competitors; however, it is known that there are a large number of companies and individuals in the oil and gas business.
Exploration for and production of oil and natural gas are affected by the availability of pipe, casing and other tubular goods, and certain other oil field equipment including drilling rigs and tools.  We depend upon independent contractors to furnish rigs, pressure pumping equipment, and tools to drill and complete our wells.  Higher prices for oil and natural gas may result in increased competition among operators for drilling and completion equipment, tubular goods, and drilling and completion crews, which may affect our ability to drill, complete, and work over wells in a timely and cost-effective manner.
The market for oil and natural gas is dependent upon a number of factors that are beyond our control and the effects of which are difficult to predict.  These factors include the proximity of wells to, and the capacity of, oil and natural gas pipelines, the extent of competitive domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the availability of other sources of energy, fluctuations in seasonal supply and demand, and governmental regulation.  In addition, new legislation may be enacted that would impose price controls or additional excise taxes on oil, natural gas, or both.  Oversupplies of oil and natural gas can be expected to occur from time to time and may result in, among other things, producing wells being shut-in.  Imports of oil and natural gas may adversely affect the market for domestic oil and natural gas.
The market price for oil is significantly affected by policies adopted by the member nations of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC.  Members of OPEC establish production quotas among themselves for petroleum products from time to time with the intent of influencing the global supply of oil and consequently price levels.  We are unable to predict the effect, if any, that OPEC, its members, or other countries will have on the amount of, or the prices received for, oil and natural gas.
11

Natural gas prices are now largely influenced by competition.  Competitors in this market include producers, natural gas pipelines and their affiliated marketing companies, independent marketers, and providers of alternate energy supplies, such as coal.  Changes in government regulations relating to the production, transportation, and marketing of natural gas have also resulted in significant changes in the historical marketing patterns of the industry.

Governmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations that change from time to time. Many of these regulations are intended to prevent pollution and protect environmental quality, including regulations related to permit requirements for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling, completing and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, groundwater testing, air emissions, noise, lighting and traffic abatement, and the plugging and reclamation of wells. Other regulations are intended to prevent the waste of oil and natural gas and to protect the rights of owners in a common reservoir. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number or density of wells that may be drilled in an area, the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells, and regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and that impose requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. In addition, our operations are subject to regulations governing the pipeline gathering and transportation of oil and natural gas as well as various federal, state, and local tax laws and regulations.
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and gas industry are generally subject to similar regulatory requirements and restrictions. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. We are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Regulation of production
Federal, state, and local agencies have promulgated extensive rules and regulations applicable to our oil and gas exploration, production, and related operations.  Most states require drilling permits, drilling and operating bonds, the filing of various reports, and the satisfaction of other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas.  Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters including provisions governing the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the density of wells, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. The number of drilling locations available to us will depend in part on the spacing of wells in our operating areas. An increase in well density in an area could result in additional locations in that area, but a reduced production performance from the area on a per-well basis. In addition, certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill may require pooling of our lease interests with the interests of third parties.  Some states like Colorado allow the statutory pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on the voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In areas with voluntary pooling, it may be more difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold, or one or more of the leases do not provide the necessary pooling authority. Further, the statutes and regulations of some states limit the rate at which oil and natural gas is produced from properties, prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. This may limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or locations at which we can drill.
The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission ("COGCC") is the primary regulator of exploration and production of oil and gas resources in the principal area in which we operate.  The COGCC regulates oil and gas operators through rules, policies, written guidance, orders, permits, and inspections. Among other things, the COGCC enforces specifications regarding drilling, development, production, reclamation, enhanced recovery, safety, aesthetics, noise, waste, flowlines, and wildlife.  In recent years, the COGCC has amended its existing regulatory requirements and adopted new requirements with increased frequency. For example, in January 2016, the COGCC approved new rules that require local government consultation and certain best management practices for large-scale oil and natural gas facilities in certain urban mitigation areas. These rules also require operator registration and/or notifications to local governments with respect to future oil and natural gas drilling and production facility locations. In February 2018, the COGCC comprehensively amended its regulations for oil, gas, and water flowlines to expand requirements addressing flowline registration and safety, integrity management, leak detection, and other matters. The COGCC has also adopted or amended numerous other rules in recent years, including rules relating to safety, flood protection, and spill reporting. In December 2018, the COGCC approved new rules that require new oil and gas sites to be situated at least 1,000 feet away from school properties such as playgrounds and athletic fields.
Regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas
Historically, transportation and sales for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 ("NGA"), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") regulations. Effective January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act deregulated the price for all "first sales" of natural gas. As a result, our sales of natural gas may be made at market prices, subject to applicable contract provisions. Since 1985, the FERC has implemented regulations intended to make natural gas transportation more accessible to gas buyers and sellers on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. We cannot predict what further action the FERC will take on these matters, but we do not 
13

believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers, gatherers, and marketers with which we compete.
In August 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the "2005 EPA") was signed into law. The 2005 EPA directs the FERC and other federal agencies to issue regulations that will further the goals set out in the 2005 EPA. The 2005 EPA amends the NGA to make it unlawful for "any entity," including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. FERC rules implementing this provision make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. This anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted "in connection with" natural gas sales, purchases, or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction.
In 2007, the FERC issued a final rule on annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements (as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing, "Order 704"). Under Order 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors, and natural gas marketers, are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704.
Gathering is exempt from federal regulation under the NGA, but is subject to various state regulations, which include safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements. FERC has in the past reclassified transportation facilities previously considered to be subject to FERC jurisdiction as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, and conversely, has also reclassified non-jurisdictional gathering facilities as subject to FERC jurisdiction. Any such changes could result in an increase to our costs of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations. 
Transportation and safety of natural gas is also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations, including regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation, through its Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA"), under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which imposes safety requirements on the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission facilities, the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 (the "PIPES Act 2006") and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the "PIPES Act 2011"). The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. 
Our production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the FERC. Our natural gas sales prices, however, continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive, along with the availability and terms of such transportation. Competition among suppliers has greatly increased in recent years. Our natural gas sales are generally made at the prevailing market price at the time of sale.
Regulation of sales and transportation of oil
Our sales of oil are affected by the availability, terms, and cost of transportation. Interstate transportation of oil by pipeline is regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act ("ICA"), the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate transportation of oil, natural gas liquids, and refined products (collectively referred to as "petroleum pipelines") be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory and that such rates and terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC regulation.
Intrastate petroleum pipeline transportation rates and certain terms of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions in some jurisdictions. The basis for intrastate petroleum pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate petroleum pipeline rates, varies from state to state.
Insofar as effective, interstate and intrastate rates and certain terms of service are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, and accordingly, we do not believe that the regulation of petroleum pipeline transportation rates or such terms of service will affect our operations in any way that is materially different than those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
14

Transportation and safety of petroleum products by pipeline is subject to regulation by PHMSA pursuant to the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as well as the PIPES Act of 2006 and the PIPES Act of 2011, which govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement, and management of liquids pipeline facilities. Petroleum products that are transported by rail may also be subject to additional regulation by PHMSA.
Environmental Regulations
As with the oil and natural gas industry in general, our properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations designed to protect and preserve natural resources and the environment.  Long-term trends in environmental legislation and regulation are generally toward stricter standards, and this trend is likely to continue.  These laws and regulations often require a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; limit or prohibit access, seismic acquisition, construction, drilling, and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas; mandate requirements and standards for operations; impose substantial liabilities and remedial obligations for pollution; and require the reclamation of certain lands.
The permits required for many of our operations are subject to revocation, modification, and renewal by issuing authorities.  Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations are subject to fines, injunctions, or both.  In March 2015, the COGCC implemented regulatory and statutory amendments that significantly increased the potential penalties for violating the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Act or its implementing regulations, orders, or permits.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and comparable state statutes impose strict and joint and several liability on owners and operators of certain sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of "hazardous substances" found at such sites.  Persons responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up those substances and for damages to natural resources. It is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.   Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of "hazardous substance," state laws affecting our operations impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum-related products.  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of "solid waste" and "hazardous waste" and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance.  Although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as non-hazardous "solid wastes," such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes, thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements. A proposed consent decree filed in December 2016 between the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and certain environmental groups commits the EPA to deciding whether to revise its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations and state plan guidelines for the oil and natural gas sector by March 2019.
Certain of our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act ("CAA") and similar state and local requirements. The CAA may require certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations. The EPA and states continue to develop regulations to implement these requirements. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air-emission-related issues. Greenhouse gas recordkeeping and reporting requirements under the CAA took effect in 2011 and impose increased administrative and control costs. Federal New Source Performance Standards regarding oil and gas operations ("NSPS OOOO") took effect in 2012, with more subsequent amendments, all of which have likewise added administrative and operational costs. In June 2016, EPA finalized new regulations under the CAA to reduce methane emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and natural gas sector (the "NSPS OOOOa"). These new regulations impose, among other things, new requirements for leak detection and repair, control requirements at oil well completions, and additional control requirements for gathering, boosting, and compressor stations. In September 2018, EPA proposed revisions to the 2016 rules. The proposed amendments address certain technical issues raised in administrative petitions and include proposed changes to, among other things, the frequency of monitoring for fugitive emissions at well sites and compressor stations. Concurrent with the proposed methane rules, the EPA also finalized a new rule regarding source determinations and permitting requirements for the onshore oil and gas industry under the CAA. Colorado adopted new regulations to meet the requirements of NSPS OOOO and promulgated significant new rules in February 2014 relating specifically to oil and natural gas operations that are more stringent than NSPS OOOO and directly regulate methane emissions from affected facilities.
In October 2015, the EPA lowered the national ambient air quality standard ("NAAQS") for ozone under the CAA from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Any resulting expansion of the ozone nonattainment areas in Colorado could cause oil and natural gas operations in such areas to become subject to more stringent emissions controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs. In addition, the ozone nonattainment status for the Denver Metro North Front Range Ozone 8-Hour Non-Attainment area was bumped up by the EPA from "marginal" to "moderate" as a result of the area failing to 
15

attain the 2008 ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of July 20, 2015. In 2016, the state of Colorado undertook a rulemaking to address the new "moderate" status, culminating in, among others, the incorporation of two existing state-only requirements for oil and natural gas operations into the federally-enforceable State Implementation Plan ("SIP"). During the fall of 2016, EPA also issued final Control Techniques Guidelines ("CTGs") for reducing volatile organic compound emissions from existing oil and natural gas equipment and processes in ozone non-attainment areas, including the Denver Metro North Front Range Ozone 8-hour Non-Attainment area. In 2017, Colorado adopted new and more stringent air quality control requirements. The Denver Metro/North Front Range NAA is at risk of being reclassified again to "serious" if it does not meet the 2008 NAAQS. While the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment ("CDPHE") may request an exception or other relief from the reclassification, it is possible that the Denver Metro/North Front Range NAA will be reclassified as "serious" by early 2020. A "serious" classification would trigger significant additional obligations for the state under the CAA and could result in new and more stringent air quality control requirements becoming applicable to our operations and significant costs and delays in obtaining necessary permits. This process could result in new or more stringent air quality control requirements applicable to our operations.
The federal Clean Water Act ("CWA") and analogous state laws impose requirements regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the U.S. and the state, including spills and leaks of hydrocarbons and produced water. The CWA also requires approval for the construction of facilities in wetlands and other waters of the U.S., and it imposes requirements on storm water run-off. In June 2016, the EPA finalized new CWA pretreatment standards that would prevent onshore unconventional oil and natural gas wells from discharging wastewater pollutants to public treatment facilities. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers adopted a new regulatory definition of "waters of the U.S.," which governs which waters and wetlands are subject to the CWA. In February 2018, the EPA issued a rule that delays the applicability of the new definition of the "waters of the U.S." until 2020. In August 2018, the U.S. District Court for South Carolina found that the EPA and the Corps failed to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act and struck the 2018 rule that attempted to delay the applicability date of the 2015 Clean Water Rule. Other district courts, however, have issued rulings temporarily enjoining the applicability of the 2015 Clean Water Rule itself. Taken together, the 2015 Clean Water Rule is currently in effect in 23 states, and temporarily stayed in the remaining states, including Colorado. In those remaining states, the 1986 rule and guidance remain in effect. In December 2018, EPA and the Corps issued a proposed new rule that would differently revise the definition of "waters of the U.S." and essentially replace both the 1986 rule and the 2015 Clean Water Rule. According to the agencies, the proposed new rule is "intended to increase CWA program predictability and consistency by increasing clarity as to the scope of ‘waters of the United States’ federally regulated under the Act." If finalized, this new definition of "waters of the U.S." will likely be challenged and sought to be enjoined in federal court.
The Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our operations may be located in areas that are or may be designated as habitats for threatened or endangered species. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and bald and golden eagles under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. In such areas, we may be prohibited from conducting operations at certain locations or during certain periods, and we may be required to develop plans for avoiding potential adverse effects. In addition, certain species are subject to varying degrees of protection under state laws.
Federal laws including the CWA require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil and produced water to prepare and implement spill prevention, control, countermeasure, and response plans addressing the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA") subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict and joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from oil spills, including the government’s response costs. Spills subject to the OPA may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities.
In 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases ("GHGs") present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth's atmosphere and other climatic conditions. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations under the CAA that, among other things, established Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD"), construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already major sources of emissions of regulated pollutants. In a subsequent ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a portion of EPA’s GHG stationary source program, but invalidated a portion of it. The Court held that stationary sources already subject to the PSD or Title V program for non-GHG criteria pollutants remained subject to GHG best available control technology ("BACT") requirements, but ruled that sources subject to the PSD or Title V program only for GHGs could not be forced to comply with GHG BACT requirements. Upon remand, the D.C. Circuit issued an amended judgment, which, among other things, vacated the PSD and Title V regulations under review in that case to the extent they require a stationary source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit solely because the source emits or has the potential to emit GHGs above the applicable major source thresholds. In October 2016, EPA issued a proposed rule to revise its PSD and Title V regulations applicable to GHGs in accordance with these court rulings, including proposing a de minimis level of GHG emissions below which BACT is not required. Depending on what EPA does in a final rule, it is possible that any regulatory or permitting obligation that limits emissions of GHGs could extend to smaller stationary sources and require 
16

us to incur costs to reduce and monitor emissions of GHGs associated with our operations and also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.
In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified GHG emission sources in the United States, including certain onshore oil and natural gas production sources, which include certain of our operations. While Congress has not enacted significant legislation relating to GHG emissions, it may do so in the future and, moreover, several state and regional initiatives have been enacted aimed at monitoring and/or reducing GHG emissions through cap and trade programs.
The adoption of new laws, regulations, or other requirements limiting or imposing other obligations on GHG emissions from our equipment and operations, and the implementation of requirements that have already been adopted, could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. In March 2017, President Trump signed the Executive Order on Energy Independence which, among other things, called for a review of EPA's August 2015 Clean Power Plan.  The EPA subsequently published a proposed rule to repeal the Clean Power Plan in October 2017. The comment period on the proposed rule closed in April 2018. In August 2018, EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule, which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE would replace the Clean Power Plan. 
Further GHG regulation may result from the December 2015 agreement reached at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris. Pursuant to the agreement, the United States made an initial pledge to a 26-28% reduction in its GHG emissions by 2025 against a 2005 baseline and committed to periodically update its pledge in five yearly intervals starting in 2020. GHG emissions in the earth’s atmosphere have also been shown to produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operations. In June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would initiate the formal process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.
Hydraulic Stimulation
We operate primarily in the Wattenberg Field of the D-J Basin where the rock formations are typically tight, and it is a common practice to use hydraulic stimulation to allow for or increase hydrocarbon production.  Hydraulic stimulation involves the process of injecting substances such as water, sand, and additives (some proprietary) under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation to create fractures, thus creating a passageway for the release of oil and gas.  Hydraulic stimulation is a technique that we commonly employ and expect to employ extensively in future wells that we drill and complete.
We outsource all hydraulic stimulation services to service providers with significant experience, and which we deem to be competent and responsible.  Our service providers supply all personnel, equipment, and materials needed to perform each stimulation, including the chemical mixtures that are injected into our wells.  We require our service companies to carry insurance covering various losses and liabilities that could arise in connection with their activities; however, insurance may not be available or adequate to cover losses and liabilities incurred, or may be prohibitively expensive relative to the perceived risk.  In addition to the drilling permit that we are required to obtain and the notice of intent that we provide the appropriate regulatory authorities, our service providers are responsible for obtaining any regulatory permits necessary for them to perform their services in the relevant geographic location.
In recent years, environmental opposition to hydraulic stimulation has increased, and various governmental and regulatory authorities have adopted or are considering new requirements for this process. To the extent that these requirements increase our costs or restrict our development activities, our business and prospects may be adversely affected.
The EPA has asserted that the Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA") applies to hydraulic stimulation involving diesel fuel, and in February 2014, it issued final guidance on this subject. The guidance defines the term "diesel fuel," describes the permitting requirements that apply under SDWA for the underground injection of diesel fuel in hydraulic stimulation, and makes recommendations for permit writers. Although the guidance applies only in those states, excluding Colorado, where the EPA directly implements the Underground Injection Control Class II program, it could encourage state regulatory authorities to adopt permitting and other requirements for hydraulic stimulation. In addition, from time to time, Congress has considered legislation that would provide for broader federal regulation of hydraulic stimulation under the SDWA. If such legislation were enacted, operators engaged in hydraulic stimulation could be required to meet additional federal permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, and provide additional public disclosure of the chemicals used in the stimulation process.
17

The EPA has also conducted a nationwide study into the effects of hydraulic stimulation on drinking water. In June 2015, the EPA released a draft study report for peer review and comment. The draft report did not find evidence of widespread systemic impacts to drinking water, but did find a relatively small number of site-specific impacts. The EPA noted that these results could indicate that such effects are rare or that other limiting factors exist. In December 2016, EPA released the final report on impacts from hydraulic stimulation activities on drinking water, concluding that hydraulic stimulation activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances and identifying some factors that could influence these impacts.
Federal agencies have also adopted or are considering additional regulation of hydraulic stimulation. In March 2016, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") issued a final rule, with effective dates of 2018 and 2021 for the hydraulic stimulation industry, which imposes stricter standards for worker exposure to silica, including worker exposure to sand in hydraulic stimulation. In May 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA") to obtain data on chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic stimulation. In March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") issued a new rule regulating hydraulic stimulation activities involving federal and tribal lands and minerals, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback and produced water. The BLM rescinded the rule in December 2017; however, the BLM’s rescission has been challenged by several states in the United States District Court of the District of Northern California.
In November 2016, the BLM finalized rules to further regulate venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. In September 2018, the BLM published a final rule that revises the 2016 rules. The new rule, among other things, rescinds the 2016 rule requirements related to waste-minimization plans, gas-capture percentages, well drilling, well completion and related operations, pneumatic controllers, pneumatic diaphragm pumps, storage vessels, and leak detection and repair. The new rule also revised provisions related to venting and flaring. Environmental groups and the States of California and New Mexico have filed challenges to the 2018 rule in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
In Colorado, the primary regulator is the COGCC, which has adopted regulations regarding chemical disclosure, pressure monitoring, prior agency notice, emission reduction practices, and offset well setbacks with respect to hydraulic stimulation operations. As part of these requirements, operators must report all chemicals used in hydraulically stimulation a well to a publicly searchable registry website developed and maintained by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission.
Apart from these ongoing federal and state initiatives, local governments are adopting new requirements and restrictions on hydraulic stimulation and other oil and gas operations. Some local governments in Colorado, for instance, have amended their land use regulations to impose new requirements on oil and gas development, while other local governments have entered into memoranda of agreement with oil and gas producers to accomplish the same objective. In addition, during the past few years, five Colorado cities have passed voter initiatives temporarily or permanently prohibiting hydraulic stimulation. Local district courts have struck down the ordinances for certain of those Colorado cities, and these decisions were upheld by the Colorado Supreme Court in May 2016. Nevertheless, there is a continued risk that cities will adopt local ordinances that seek to regulate the time, place, and manner of hydraulic stimulation activities, and oil and gas operations generally, within their respective jurisdictions.
