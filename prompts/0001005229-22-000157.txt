Item 1.        Business
General
Columbus McKinnon Corporation ("Columbus McKinnon" or the "Company") is a leading worldwide designer, manufacturer and marketer of intelligent motion solutions that move the world forward and improve lives by efficiently and ergonomically moving, lifting, positioning and securing materials. Key products include hoists, crane components, precision conveyor systems, rigging tools, light rail workstations and digital power and motion control systems. These are highly relevant, professional-grade solutions that solve customers’ critical material handling requirements. 
The Company is focused on commercial and industrial applications that require the safety, reliability and quality provided by its superior design and engineering know-how. Our products are used for mission critical applications where we have established, trusted brands with significant customer retention. Our targeted market verticals include general industries, transportation, energy and utilities, process industries, industrial automation, construction and infrastructure, food and beverage, entertainment, life sciences, consumer packaged goods and e-commerce/supply chain/warehousing.
On April 7, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Dorner Mfg. Corp. ("Dorner"). Dorner, headquartered in Hartland, Wisconsin, is a leading automation solutions company providing unique, patented technologies in the design, application, manufacturing and integration of high-precision conveying systems. The acquisition of Dorner accelerates the Company’s shift to intelligent motion and serves as a platform to expand capabilities in advanced, higher technology automation solutions. Dorner is a leading supplier to the stable life sciences, food processing, and consumer packaged goods markets as well as the high growth industrial automation and e-commerce sectors. The addition of Dorner provides attractive complementary adjacencies including sortation and asynchronous conveyance systems. Dorner offers a broad range of precision conveying systems to our product offerings, which include low profile, flexible chain, large scale, sanitary and vertical elevation conveyor systems, as well as pallet system conveyors.
In addition, on December 1, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Garvey Corporation ("Garvey"), which further expanded its precision conveyance offerings. Garvey is a leading accumulation systems solutions company providing unique, patented systems for the automation of production processes whose products complement those of Dorner. The acquisitions of Dorner and Garvey accelerate the Company’s shift to intelligent motion and serves as a platform to expand capabilities in advanced, higher technology automation solutions.
In the United States, we are the market leader for hoists, material handling digital power control systems and precision conveyors, our principal lines of products, and have strong market positions with certain chain, forged fittings, and actuator products. Additionally, in Europe, we believe we are the market leader for manual hoists and a market leader in the heavy load, rail and niche custom applications for actuation. We have achieved this leadership position through strategic acquisitions, our extensive, diverse, and well-established distribution channels and our commitment to product innovation and quality. We believe the substantial breadth of our product offering and broad distribution channels in the United States and Europe provide us a strategic advantage in our markets. The acquisition of STAHL CraneSystems ("STAHL") in fiscal 2017, which is well renowned for its custom engineering lifting solutions and hoisting technology, advanced our position as a global leader in the production of explosion-protected hoists. STAHL serves independent crane builders and Engineering Procurement and Construction ("EPC") firms, providing products to a variety of end markets including automotive, general manufacturing, oil and gas, steel and concrete, power generation, as well as process industries such as chemical and pharmaceuticals.
We initiated our Blueprint for Growth strategy in early fiscal 2018. It originally had three phases. In Phase 1, which was completed during fiscal 2018, we focused on instilling a performance-based culture to drive results, which included reorganizing the business into three product groups. Phase II, which began in the latter half of fiscal 2018, included simplifying the business with our 80/20 process, improving our operational excellence, and ramping the growth engine by investing in new product development and a digital platform to grow profitably. Through the simplification process, we identified three businesses in our portfolio that were not a fit with our product offerings and strategy that represented approximately $38 million in revenue in fiscal 2018. By the end of fiscal 2019, we divested these three businesses and completed the closure of one manufacturing facility in Ohio, which provided $2 million in cost savings in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2020, the Company began to further reduce its manufacturing footprint by initiating the closure and consolidation of our remaining facility in Ohio into other U.S. facilities, which was completed in fiscal 2021. Similarly, one of our manufacturing facilities in China was closed during fiscal 2020 and its operations were consolidated into our other manufacturing facility in China. A small operation in France was closed during fiscal 2021. The annual savings from these factory consolidations is approximately $8.3 million. Simplification with the 80/20 process and other operational efficiencies implemented enabled the consolidations without reducing our ability to serve our customers and address demand. Phase III of the strategy was centered on evolving the business 
model including optimizing our current product portfolio as well as pursuing acquisitions to advance our transformation into a leading intelligent motion solutions company. The Dorner and Garvey transactions are examples of these types of acquisitions.
We have since evolved our Blueprint for Growth strategy to version 2.0 in order to accelerate our pivot to growth with an emphasis on broadening our expertise in intelligent motion solutions for material handling. Our Blueprint for Growth 2.0 strategy is focused on delivering above market growth through organic and inorganic initiatives as well as improved financial performance, which we believe drives shareholder value creation. The strategy is underpinned with the Columbus McKinnon Business System, ("CMBS") that provides the discipline, processes and core competencies necessary to scale our business. At the core of CMBS are our people and our values. 
With CMBS as the foundation, we are well positioned to execute the Core Growth Framework of our Blueprint for Growth 2.0 strategy. The Framework defines four parallel paths for Columbus McKinnon’s growth and provides clear organic and strategic initiatives.  Our Core Growth framework includes:
•Strengthening the Core which is a foundational path focused on initiatives that will strengthen competencies and improve our competitive position within our existing share of our Serviceable Addressable Market (”SAM”). Initiatives include further developing commercial and product management competencies and improving our digital tools for a better, more efficient customer experience.
•Growing the Core is a path that is focused on taking greater marker share, both organically and through acquisitions, within our SAM. We are making progress on this path with product localization, new product development and advancements in automation and aftermarket support for our distributors. 
•Expanding the Core is a path that is focused on improved channel access and geographic expansion. Here we expand beyond our SAM into the broader Total Addressable Market (“TAM”). This involves building out our presence both geographically and in new verticals with expanded offerings, which we expect we can accomplish organically as well as with acquisitions. 
•Reimagining the core is a more transformational path that rethinks our TAM and targets strategic expansion beyond our existing TAM. As we think more broadly about material handling and increasing trends in intelligent motion, not just lifting, but solutions for how materials move throughout customer environments, there are some compelling ideas that emerge. The Dorner and Garvey acquisitions are examples of reimagining Columbus McKinnon’s core, which added an additional $5 billion to our TAM, with the specialty conveying microsegment growing at an estimated 6% to 8% rate annually. 
The strategy is geared toward investing in new products that solve our customers’ tough problems and expanding into new platforms that provide intelligent motion solutions for material handling, such as precision conveyance capabilities. We believe the acquisitions of Dorner and Garvey establish a platform for expansion supported by new product development, a fragmented competitive landscape and complementary adjacencies. It also allows Dorner and Garvey to expand geographically by having access to our global footprint and provides us with an entry point into a pipeline of additional acquisition opportunities in the fragmented precision conveying industry.
Our legacy Lifting business is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including changes in industrial capacity utilization, industrial production, and general economic activity indicators, like GDP growth. Both U.S. and Eurozone capacity utilization and the ISM Production Index are leading market indicators for our Company.

Independent Crane Builders and Engineering Procurement and Construction ("EPC") firms - In addition to the Distribution Channels mentioned above, we sell explosion-protected hoists and custom engineered non-standard hoists to independent crane builders and EPC firms. Independent crane builders are lifting solution developers and final crane assemblers that source hoists as components. EPC firms are responsible for project management or construction management of production facilities that purchase lifting solutions from crane and hoist builders.
Backlog

Our backlog of orders at March 31, 2022 was approximately $309,052,000, including $60,223,000 of backlog related to the Dorner and Garvey acquisitions, compared to approximately $171,698,000 at March 31, 2021. The increase is a result of growing order rates as markets recover from COVID-19, backlog related to the acquired businesses, as well as higher than normal backlog due to supply chain challenges. Our orders for standard products are generally shipped within one week. Orders for products that are manufactured to customer specifications are generally shipped within four to twelve weeks. Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales. Fluctuations in backlog can reflect the project-oriented nature of certain aspects of our business.
Competitive Conditions

The material handling and precision conveyance industries remains fragmented. We face competition from a wide range of regional, national, and international manufacturers globally. In addition, we often compete with individual operating units of larger, highly diversified companies.
The principal competitive factors affecting our business include customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability, and price. Other important factors include distributor relationships and territory coverage as well as the robustness of our digital tools which impacts the customer experience.
We believe we have leading U.S. market share in various products categories including hoists, trolleys and components, AC and DC material handling drives, screw jacks, and elevator DC drives. These product categories represented 53% of our U.S. net sales for fiscal 2022.
Major competitors for hoists are Konecranes, and Kito (and its U.S. subsidiary Harrington); for chain are Campbell Chain, Peerless Chain Company (acquired by Kito), and American Chain and Cable Company; for digital power control systems are Konecranes, Power Electronics International, Inc., Cattron Holdings (a division of Harbour Group), Conductix-Wampfler (a division of Delachaux Group), Control Techniques (a division of Nidec Corporation), OMRON Corporation, KEB GmbH, and Fujitec; for forged attachments are The Crosby Group, Brewer Tichner Company and Chicago Hardware and Fixture Company; for actuators and rotary unions are Deublin, Joyce-Dayton, and Nook Industries, a division of Altra Industrial Motion Corp.; and for precision conveyors and accumulators are FlexLink, Bosch Rexroth AG, MK North America, Inc., Duravant, Nercon Eng. & Mfg. Inc and Arrowhead Systems. 
Human Capital Management

Headquartered in Buffalo, New York, Columbus McKinnon’s global footprint includes offices and manufacturing facilities in more than 24 countries across North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. At March 31, 2022, we had 3,224 employees globally. Approximately 6% of our employees are represented under two separate U.S. collective bargaining agreements that expire in May 2024 and September 2024. We also have various labor agreements with our non-U.S. employees that we negotiate from time to time. We have good relationships with our employees and positive, productive 
relationships with our unions. We believe the risk of employee or union led disruption in production is remote. The acquisitions of Dorner and Garvey in fiscal 2022 added approximately 596 employees to our global workforce and five primary manufacturing facilities.
Successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing, and retaining key employees and members of
our management team, which we achieve through the following:
•We always begin with people and values at the center of all that we do and at the heart of our corporate social responsibility efforts. The Company’s people and the behaviors they display define our success, including integrity, respect and teamwork. Many of our material social factors, including Employee Health and Safety, Training and Development, Talent Recruitment and Retention, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and Community Involvement, are directly connected to our commitment to people and values. Our people enable us to grow, and our values ensure we grow responsibly and sustainably. 
•The Company places the highest priority on workplace safety. We feel it is critical to ensure our most valuable assets, our employees, have a safe environment to work in every day. “Connect safety to everything you do” highlights the importance of safety to our culture. As a permanent agenda item at all management meetings, safety comes first. For fiscal 2022, the Company had an overall safety incident rate of 0.70 (number of injuries and illnesses multiplied by 200,000, divided by hours worked). This figure excludes our fiscal 2022 acquisitions of Dorner and Garvey which will be incorporated in Fiscal 2023.
•We are committed to embracing diversity, equity and inclusion and making it a part of everything we do. We know the positive impact diverse and inclusive teams have on our business, employees, customers, and communities around the world. We are dedicated to building a company that future generations can be proud of and a team that embraces diversity and appreciates differences across the enterprise. We have embedded diversity, equity and inclusion into the People and Values framework of the Columbus McKinnon Business System. We are working to create an environment of inclusion. We launched a series of virtual training modules around diversity, inclusion and unconscious bias. We have updated our core value “Win as a team” to specifically address embracing diversity. 
As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented strict safety protocols at our sites, as recommended by medical and public health experts. We continue to have regular communication with employees to keep them abreast of the corporate-wide expectations and posted signage throughout our facilities reminds our associates of the new heightened safety protocols, including frequent cleaning and increased sanitization efforts to keep our employees safe. Associates where possible are being brought back to the office in a hybrid working model, increasing site collaboration while maintaining flexibility. 
We also recognize our corporate responsibility to advance our Environmental Social and Governance (“ESG”) efforts and to be held accountable for making progress. We are making significant investments in our people and systems to enable meaningful progress in areas including, but not limited to, environmental stewardship, safety for our employees, workplace diversity and inclusion, connecting with our communities, and strong governance and risk management. We are taking deliberate steps to fully integrate ESG into our enterprise strategy, our business system, and our daily actions.
In fiscal 2022, we made it a priority to articulate our Purpose - Together we create intelligent motion solutions that move the world forward and improve lives. 
In addition, we also set the following objectives for fiscal 2022:
•Make significant investments in forward advancement of ESG (People & Technology enablers);
•Perform extensive data collection and analysis to identify areas for improvement;
•Build upon our baseline year ESG metrics;
•Build upon our legacy products and commitment to customers, while also growing through acquisitions;
•Launch our CMCO Cares platform, a more formal and centralized process for corporate giving and community involvement; and
•Be more transparent with internal and external stakeholders through communications and public disclosures.
As we look forward to fiscal 2023 and beyond, we have additional plans that will continue to move our ESG initiatives forward. We continue to collect and analyze data to set realistic, yet challenging goals. We expect to publish several of these goals in our next Corporate Social Responsibility Report.
Raw Materials and Components

Our principal raw material and component purchases aggregated to approximately $368 million in fiscal 2022 (or 62% of Cost of product sold in fiscal 2022) and included steel, consisting of rod, wire, bar, structural, and other forms of steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses; electro-mechanical components; 
conveyors; accumulators and standard variable drives. We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under agreements that are negotiated on a Company-wide basis through our global purchasing group. Generally, as we experience fluctuations in our costs, we reflect these increases in costs as price increases to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral. Currently, as a result of global supply chain challenges, we are experiencing higher raw material costs. To date, we have successfully raised prices several times globally to our customers to cover these increased raw material costs and protect gross margins. 
Environmental and Other Governmental Regulation

Like most manufacturing companies, we are subject to various federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. To address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities must comply, and all of our employees have the duty to comply, with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards. We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business. We have made, and could be required to continue to make, significant expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring us to incur additional expenditures to ensure environmental regulatory compliance. However, we are not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally OSHA in the U.S. and others outside the U.S. and regulations thereunder. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.
