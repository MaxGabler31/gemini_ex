General
 Onto Innovation is a worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of process control tools that perform macro-defect inspection and 2D/3D optical metrology, lithography systems, and process control analytical software used by bare silicon wafer manufacturers, semiconductor wafer fabricators, and advanced packaging manufacturers. Our products are also used for process control in a number of other high technology markets, including manufacturing of light emitting diodes (“LED”), vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (“VCSEL”), micro-electromechanical systems (“MEMS”), CMOS image sensors (“CIS”), compound semiconductor (SiC and GaN) power devices, RF filters and modules, data storage, and certain industrial and scientific applications.
 We provide process and yield management solutions used in bare silicon wafer production and wafer processing facilities, often referred to as “front-end” manufacturing, and advanced packaging of chips and test facilities, or “back-end” manufacturing, through a portfolio of standalone systems for optical metrology, macro-defect inspection, packaging lithography, probe card test and analysis, as well as transparent and opaque thin film measurements. Our automated and integrated metrology systems measure critical dimensions, device structures, topography, shape, and various thin film compositions, including three-dimensional features and film thickness, as well as optical, electrical and material properties. Our primary area of focus are products that provide critical yield-enhancing and actionable information, which is used by microelectronic device manufacturers to drive down scrap costs and to decrease the time to market of their next-generation devices.  Our systems feature sophisticated software and production-worthy automation. In addition, our advanced process control software portfolio includes powerful solutions for standalone tools, groups of tools, factory-wide, and enterprise-wide suites to enhance productivity and achieve significant cost savings. Our systems are backed by worldwide customer service and applications support. 
 2019 Merger
 On October 25, 2019, we became Onto Innovation Inc. upon the effectiveness of the merger (the “2019 Merger”) between Nanometrics Incorporated (“Nanometrics”) and Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (“Rudolph”).  We accounted for the 2019 Merger as a reverse acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). GAAP requires that either Nanometrics or Rudolph is designated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes (“Accounting Acquirer”). Based on the evidence available, Rudolph was designated as the Accounting Acquirer while Nanometrics was the acquirer for legal purposes. Therefore, Rudolph’s historical results of operations replaced Nanometrics’ historical results of operations for all periods prior to the 2019 Merger. See Note 3 in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more details regarding the 2019 Merger. However, ONTO stock price and volumes prior to October 25, 2019 are Nanometrics (NANO) stock data.
Key Events in Fiscal 2021 
 Business Combination.  In the first quarter of 2021, the Company acquired Inspectrology, LLC, a supplier of overlay metrology for controlling lithography and etch processes in the compound semiconductor market.  The purchase consideration consisted of $24.0 million in cash paid at closing and an earnout subject to achievement of certain revenue targets earned for fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2022.  As of January 1, 2022, $2.3 million of the earnout has been achieved with potential for up to an additional payment of $5.0 million based on fiscal 2022 results.
 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the way that we conduct business but has not had a material adverse impact on our operations.  We have not experienced significant delays in customer deliveries, but we are impacted by the global shortage in electronic components and our supply chain is strained in some cases as the availability of materials, logistics and freight options are challenging in many jurisdictions.  The ultimate extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and very difficult to predict, including the effectiveness and utilization of vaccines for COVID-19 and its variants, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and actions to contain or limit their spread.
 Industry Background
 We participate in the sale, design, manufacture, marketing and support of process control systems for optical critical dimension (“OCD”) metrology, thin film metrology, silicon wafer inspection, 2D and 3D macro inspection and lithography tools for advanced packaging and advanced analytical software for semiconductor manufacturing as well as inspection systems

for certain industrial applications and scientific research. Our principal market is semiconductor capital equipment.  Semiconductors packaged as integrated circuits, or “chips”, are used in consumer electronics, server and enterprise systems, mobile computing (including smart phones and tablets), data storage devices, and embedded automotive and control systems. Our core focus is the measurement and control of the structure, composition, and geometry of semiconductor devices as they are fabricated on silicon wafers to improve device performance and manufacturing yields. Our end customers manufacture many types of integrated circuits for a multitude of applications, each having unique manufacturing challenges. This includes integrated circuits to enable information processing and management (logic integrated circuits), memory storage (NAND, 3D-NAND, and DRAM), analog devices (e.g., Wi-Fi and 5G radio integrated circuits, power devices), MEMS sensor devices (accelerometers, pressure sensors, microphones), CMOS image sensors, and other specialty end markets including components for hard disk drives, LEDs, and power management devices.
 Current Trends
 Business Environment
 Our metrology systems and software are primarily used for controlling certain manufacturing processes utilized in the production of advanced, or leading-edge, wafer designs. The shrinking of features such as the constituents that form a single transistor are known as node reductions. The numeric identification of a specific node usually refers to a dimension associated with one of the transistor’s constituents. Advanced nodes are associated with transistor dimensions less than 16nm.  One of our largest customers produces advanced nodes as small as 5nm and began pre-production of 3nm in 2021. Our metrology systems used to measure and characterize these small features are generally purchased when a customer is beginning to manufacture at a new, smaller node, in order to set up and test new manufacturing equipment being installed for the new node. Our process control/metrology equipment is generally installed prior to the installation of the actual process equipment for that reason. Additional process control equipment is normally purchased when the initial process yields have been stabilized and more manufacturing capacity is required to meet production demands. Therefore, our sales to customers for advanced nodes is generally higher when manufacturing lines for new nodes are being established and may not represent continuous sales revenue until our initial systems reach high levels of utilization driven by the need for greater capacity. 
 Our inspection systems, lithography systems, and software are primarily used for processing and inspecting advanced packaging associated with the back-end manufacturing. The advanced packaging techniques represent a very wide variety of assembly methods in order to connect individual chips to a larger PC board, or connecting a group of chips together to form a “system in a package” (“SIP”), also known as heterogeneous integration (“HI”), or chiplets. Many of these advanced packages require lithographic imaging to produce copper interconnections between the chip and the PC Board or between chips in the case of SIP or HI advanced packages. Our inspection systems and software are used for process control and detection of potential reliability failures in nearly all of these packages. Unlike the cyclical nature of our metrology equipment associated with node shrinks, our sales revenue for advanced packaging is generally driven by assembly volumes. Inspection rates for advanced packages are high throughout the assembly process to avoid a single defective chip from being assembled into a relatively expensive package, making the inspection process control systems attach rates quite linear with production volumes of these devices. The introduction of 5G handsets and high-performance computing (“HPC”) continue to drive demand for advanced packaging; however, macroeconomic conditions, including COVID-19 and U.S-China trade disputes could curtail demand for higher volumes in the future. 
 In 2020, a significant portion of the global workforce began working from home as part of corporate efforts to isolate and protect workers from COVID-19. This transition resulted in extremely high usage of data centers and cloud processing that drove higher demand for increased memory and HPC devices. In addition, wireless 5G networks drove demand for new 5G phones in 2021. That demand is expected to continue in the first half of 2022 as new phones from Apple and Samsung were introduced to the market in 2021. The building of the 5G network over the next several years will also bring more machine-to-machine communications. These macro-drivers will increase the need for semiconductors and advanced packaging to deliver higher computing power in a single package and faster speeds for memory and logic devices, while reducing power consumption and cost. Such advances are generally achieved by node reductions/shrinks and by advanced packaging for high bandwidth memory and HI packaging. As discussed above, these trends in front-end and back-end manufacturing complexity are driving the demand for sophisticated metrology and inspection systems in order to achieve the semiconductor performance required while achieving a profitable manufacturing yield.  
 Since the first fiscal quarter of 2020, Onto Innovation has launched eight new products that include five new metrology systems, one new macro defect inspection system, a panel lithography tool and a new metrology software engine. These new products were introduced as logic IDMs and foundries were increasing their capacity while following aggressive plans to transition their manufacturing to smaller nodes. Other customer interactions at memory and specialty device manufacturers as well as providers of advanced packaging centered around satisfying the immediate demand for these devices with our existing product portfolio, while partnering with R&D groups to prepare for the process controls needed for the next generation of

semiconductors and packaging that will require the latest systems from Onto Innovation. We believe our strong engineering teams have delivered, and will continue to deliver, new products to our customers, followed by our field engineers providing customer support, while simultaneously achieving our gross and operating margin targets that were established in our long-term operating models. Revenues in the four quarters of 2021 increased sequentially as customers transitioned to advanced nodes and increased advanced packaging volumes, and the Company was able to achieve operating margins and earnings at the high end of our quarterly guidance and analysts’ estimates.
Markets
 Advanced Nodes. refers to leading-edge integrated circuits where the feature sizes of transistors and other features continue to shrink in specified steps, or nodes measured in nanometers (nm). Demand for our products continues to be driven by our customers' desire for higher overall chip performance without increasing the chip size, while improving power efficiency, logic processing capability, data storage volume and manufacturing yield. To achieve these goals, our customers have increased their use of more complex materials and processing methods in their manufacturing flow. The primary paths for performance gains are geometric scaling, known as node shrinks, or scaling of transistor dimensions. In some cases, our customers are implementing new materials and methods in high volume manufacturing, including materials and device architectures to reduce power consumption, and stacked devices. To scale NAND memory, a 3D stacking architecture has been implemented at several customers with more than 150 storage cell layers for devices in production. Additional innovation continues in Data Storage, Power Devices, MEMS, and Image Sensors. We believe the use of these new materials and manufacturing methods has increased demand for our products such as the Atlas® product line that is capable of measuring these advanced nodes as certain features shrink to 7nm, 5nm and 3nm.  
 To shrink features, new methods, including multiple patterning lithography and extreme ultra-violet (“EUV”) lithography, have been developed. The EUV process is driving significantly higher requirements for the silicon wafers that are entering the EUV chamber. Small, particles on the backside of the wafer measuring a few micrometers (microns) can distort the images being projected onto the top side. The NovusEdge® inspection tool has been installed at major silicon wafer manufacturers to detect backside contamination and edge cracking as a final quality control mechanism before wafers are shipped to the semiconductor fabrication processes. The top side of wafers used for the EUV process is covered with an epitaxial layer, which must also be scanned for any impurities. This compositional analysis is measured using our Element® system using Fourier Transform Infrared (“FTIR”) algorithms.   
 Advanced Packaging. refers to a variety of technologies that enable the miniaturization of electronic products, such as portable consumer devices, including smartphones, watches, and tablets. Historically, integrated circuit packaging refers to the final stage of semiconductor device fabrication, in which a single circuit made from semiconducting material (a die or chip) is encased in a molded package using small wires to provide connections to a carrier that can be soldered to a printed circuit board and also prevents physical damage and corrosion to the chip. Advanced Packaging refers loosely to the multi-layer conductors and chip structures (other than wires) that often interconnect multiple die, feed them with electric power and create signal paths to and from the PC board, dissipate their heat, and protect them from damage. Today, the drive to pack more functions into a small space and reduce their power requirements demands that chip packages do much more than ever before to combine multiple chips and functions into a single molded package.  
 One example of the technology used in Advanced Packaging is the 3D integration of semiconductors. This technology involves stacking individual chips in one integrated package. Through-silicon vias (“TSVs”) are vertical copper interconnects that are embedded from the bottom surface of a die to the top surface and uses small copper/solder “bumps” to connect one chip to another, which allows power and communication to be shared among the individually stacked components. This offers the advantages of shorter signal paths and, in turn, reduced power consumption, enhanced bandwidths, integration of heterogeneous components such as memory and logic chips, and smaller surface area. The processes required for 3D integration vary from one manufacturer to another and many continue to be optimized for yield and to ensure the functioning of individual stacked chips. 
 Heterogeneous packages are another advanced packaging technology using copper pillars/bumps to vertically connect a wide variety of stacked die for 2.5D, and 3D integration techniques as well as horizontally connected chips and are considered the next disruptive technology for several reasons. First, heterogeneous integrated packages using 3D stacking can significantly reduce the space needed inside an electronic device, such as a smartphone, by combining multiple chips/functions into a single package, often called a System-in-Package (“SIP”). Next, it improves the system’s performance by reducing power and signal conductor lengths, which previously were routed from package to package through a printed circuit (“PC”) board. Using thin redistribution layers (“RDLs”) to connect chips that are side-by-side or “fan out” power and signal connections to the larger contacts on the PC board, which accounts for 35 percent of the packaging cost. Lastly, the technology is currently considered the preferred vehicle for next generation uses, such as SIP, and package on package formats.  As a result of the small overall form factor, heterogeneous integrated packages provide the functionality needed in high-end mobile and wearable products.

The current and projected adoption of smart mobile devices with designed-in capability to enable multiple functions in a single device continues to grow.  There are no longer single function devices, but instead, a combined single device provides multiple functions such as phone, GPS, camera, and internet browser. Aided by a myriad of available “apps,” the potential uses seem endless. As a result, these added functions in mobile products are driving semiconductor advanced packaging and display manufacturers to implement next-generation technologies, such as 5G communications, to meet these requirements. These technology shifts encompass multiple high-value process steps that are creating opportunities for our solutions. 
 ​Panel Manufacturing. One current process to manufacture advanced packaging involves attaching known good die to a 300mm wafer, used as a temporary carrier when adding components such as RDLs and copper pillars.  SIP packages can often contain side-by-side die, meaning the package can be large and limit the number of packages being placed on a reconstituted wafer. In order to meet the growing demand at reduced average selling prices, manufacturers are looking to scalable technology. Advanced packaging facilities looking to improve Cost of Ownership (“CoO”) and increase productivity are transitioning from 300mm wafers to large rectangular panels, which can be as large as 600mm x 600mm. This larger size enables companies manufacturing large area packages to increase the number of devices being processed at each step as they are no longer limited to operating within the constraints of a round wafer. By responding to market opportunities and addressing the stringent demands of customers’ technical roadmaps, we believe that Onto Innovation is optimally positioned to capitalize on the emerging market of high-volume panel manufacturing.  For example, the JetStep® X500 lithography system, having emerged from the flat panel display market, is readily capable of processing RDLs on organic laminate panels in the semiconductor advanced packaging market. The Firefly® series, designed for high resolution inspection, can provide defect detection and location information to the JetStep X500 tool for each die, which greatly improves lithography throughput using our exclusive StepFAST™ process. It also delivers a combination of defect classification and process throughput in a single software platform. It reduces capital investment requirements and provides a reliable pathway to transition from wafer to panel-based processes.
 Technology
 We believe that our expertise in our core technologies of optics and software and our combined investment in research and development will enable us to rapidly develop new technologies and products as we have demonstrated over the past two years of operation in order to quickly respond to emerging industry trends and competitive challenges. The breadth of our technology enables us to offer a diverse combination of process and process control solutions. Unique features have been designed into our lithography systems to meet our customers’ changing process requirements. Our metrology and inspection technologies provide process control for the majority of advanced node wafers processed today in a semiconductor wafer fab. In front-end processes, OCD metrology, thin film metrology, wafer stress metrology and macro defect detection and classification technologies allow yield enhancement for critical processes such as photolithography, diffusion, etch, chemical mechanical planarization (“CMP”) and outgoing quality control. Within the back-end manufacturing processes, our 2D/3D advanced macro defect inspection provides our customers with critical quality assurance and process information. Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing, assembly processes (RDLs, TSVs, copper pillars, etc.) or general handling and can have a major impact on device and process quality. Lastly, we turn the gathered data into useful knowledge for our customers to make yield-enhancing decisions, which lower their scrap cost and environmental impact and improve their margins.

Integrated Metrology Systems. Our integrated metrology (“IM”) systems are installed directly onto wafer processing equipment to provide near real-time measurements for improved process control and maximum throughput. Our IM systems are sold directly to end user customers. The IMPULSE® family of products includes the latest technology for OCD, and thin film metrology, and have been successfully qualified on numerous independent Wafer Fabrication Equipment Suppliers’ platforms. 
 Silicon Wafer All-surface Inspection/Characterization. “All-surface” refers to inspection of the wafer frontside, edge, and backside as well as wafer’s locator notch. The edge inspection process focuses on the area near the wafer edge, an area that poses difficulty for traditional wafer frontside inspection technology due to its varied topography and process variation. Edge bevel inspection looks for defects on the side edge of a wafer. Edge bead removal and edge exclusion metrology involve a topside surface measurement required exclusively in the lithography process, primarily to determine if wafers have been properly aligned for the edge exclusion region. The primary reason for wafer backside inspection is to determine if contamination has been created that may spread throughout the wafer fab. For instance, it is critical that the wafer backside be free of defects prior to the EUV lithography process to prevent focus and exposure problems on the wafer frontside. 
  Our materials characterization products include systems that are used to monitor the physical, optical, electrical and material characteristics of discrete electronic industry, opto-electronic, HB-LED (high brightness LEDs), solar PV (solar photovoltaics), compound semiconductor, strained silicon and silicon-on-insulator (“SOI”) devices, including composition, crystal structure, layer thickness, dopant concentration, contamination and electron mobility.  
  We have a broad portfolio of products for materials characterization including photoluminescence mapping and Fourier Transform Infrared (“FTIR”) spectroscope in automated and manual systems for substrate quality and epitaxial thickness metrology. The NanoSpec® line supports thin film measurement across all applications in both low volume production and research applications.  
 Macro Defect Inspection. Chip manufacturers deploy advanced macro defect inspection throughout the production line to monitor key process steps, gather process-enhancing information and ultimately, lower manufacturing costs. Field-established tools such as the F30™, NSX®, and the latest Dragonfly® G3 inspection systems are found in the wafer fab (front-end) and packaging (back-end) facilities around the world. These high-speed tools incorporate features such as wafer-less recipe creation, tool-to-tool correlation and multiple inspection resolutions. Using Discover® yield management software, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed and classified to determine trends and locate root causes that directly affect yield. 
 Automated Defect Classification and Pattern Analysis. Automating the defect detection and classification process is best done by a system that can mimic, or even extend, the response of the human eye, but at a much higher speed, with higher resolution and more consistency. To do this, our systems capture full-color whole wafer images using simultaneous dark and bright field illumination. The resulting bright and dark field images are compared to those from an “ideal” wafer having no defects. When a difference is detected, its image is broken down into mathematical vectors that allow rapid and accurate comparison with a library of known classified defects stored in the tool’s database. Patented and proprietary enhancements of this approach enable very fast and highly repeatable image classification. The system is pre-programmed with an extensive library of local, global, and color defects and can also store a virtually unlimited amount of new defect classes. This allows customers to define defects based on their existing defect classification system, provides more reliable automated rework decisions and enables more accurate statistical process control data. Reviewing defects off-line enables automated inspection systems to maintain their utilization for high throughput inspection. Using defect image files captured by automated inspection systems, operators are able to view high-resolution defect images to determine defects that cause catastrophic failure of a device, known as killer defects. Combining the review process with classifying defects enables faster analysis by grouping defects found together as one larger defect, a scratch for example, and defects of similar types across a wafer lot to be grouped based on size, repeating defects, and other user-defined specifications. 
 Yield Analysis. Using wafer maps, charts and graphs, the massive amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed to determine trends across bumps, die, wafers and lots. This analysis may determine where a process variation or deviation has occurred, allowing process engineers to make corrections or enhancements to increase yields. Defect data analysis is performed to identify, analyze and locate the source of defects and other manufacturing process excursions. Using either a single wafer map or a composite map created from multiple wafer maps, this analysis enables identification of defect patterns and distribution. When combined with inspection data from inspection points -placed strategically, this analysis may pinpoint the source of the defects so corrective action can be taken. 
 Opaque Film Metrology. The MetaPULSE® systems allow customers to simultaneously measure the thickness and other properties of up to six metal or non-metallic opaque film layers without physically contacting product wafers. PULSE® technology uses an ultra-fast laser to generate acoustic waves that pass down through a stack of opaque films such as those used in copper or aluminum interconnect processes, as well as the hard mask layer in 3D NAND chips, sending back to the

surface a reflected signal (echo) that indicates film thickness, density, and other process critical parameters. We believe we are a leader in providing systems that can measure opaque thin-film stacks non-destructively with the speed and accuracy semiconductor device manufacturers demand in order to achieve high yields with the latest fabrication processes. The technology is ideal for characterizing copper interconnect structures. The MetaPULSE systems, used initially for fast and accurate measurements of metal interconnect in front-end wafer fabs, have now been chosen by back-end manufacturers to perform system measurements in new process applications such as RF filters and modules, driven by the need for on-product metrology as feature sizes decrease and pattern densities increase. 
 Probe Card Test and Analysis. The combination of fast 3D-OCM (optical comparative metrology) technology with improved testing accuracy and repeatability is designed to reduce total test time for even the most advanced large area probe cards. The 3D capabilities enable users to analyze probe marks and probe tips in a rapid and information-rich format. 
  Industrial, Scientific, and Research Markets ― 4D Technology. The 4D business offers a line of interferometry systems for the measurement and inspection of high precision surfaces. End markets include high precision optics surfaces and components, aerospace and defense components, and unique research and scientific instrumentation that requires the unique high-speed results of the 4D systems.  
 Advanced Packaging Lithography.  Our lithography steppers use projection optics to expose circuit patterns from a mask or reticle onto a substrate to expose images with optimal fidelity. These systems employ a bright light that is transmitted through a mask or reticle containing display circuit patterns. Substrates are aligned on the system and the mask is imaged through a projection lens onto photoresist material coated on the substrate. The substrate is then moved, or “stepped,” to a second position to expose an adjacent area. Images can be “stitched” together precisely to form larger circuit patterns without any noticeable change in circuit performance. The system repeats the step and exposure process until the entire substrate is patterned. Once the exposure process has been completed, the substrate is developed with an alkali solution to reveal the underlying material. The imaged photoresist serves as a stencil barrier that allows for the processing of the underlying metal or insulating layers.  The substrates then continue through the etching, stripping and deposition processes until multi-layer circuits are completed. 
 In order to deal with increased input/output (“I/O”) resulting from devices with enhanced functionality, power distribution efficiency, and higher frequency, integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”) and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (“OSATs”) facilities must incorporate lithography capabilities to create RDLs for their advanced packaging technologies. However, the associated substrates and processes are significantly different than those used in front-end wafer processing. For advanced packaging, the lithography system must perform in a completely different application, with significantly different operating parameters. For example, most packaging is an additive process, while wafer processing is subtractive, and thick films, rather than thin films, are used to enable the creation of features. In order for equipment to effectively function in this environment, it must overcome these challenges. Our JetStep® systems have been specifically designed to meet these challenges head on. The new JetStep X500 System is designed for rectangular substrates (panels), which when combined with user-selectable wavelength options, maximizes throughput while not limiting resolution when needed. High-fidelity optics are able to image the fine features required while at the same time achieving superior depth of field to minimize non-flatness that is typical for advanced packaging applications. On-the-fly auto focus and an innovative reticle management system improve yield and utilization. These features result in a revolutionary lithography system specifically designed to meet advanced packaging challenges. 
 Process Control Software. We provide a wide range of advanced process control solutions, which are designed to improve factory profitability, including run-to-run control, fault detection, classification and tool automation. We are a leading provider of process control software in the semiconductor industry. Advanced process control (“APC”) employs software to automatically detect or predict tool failure (fault detection) as well as calculate recipe settings for a process that will drive the yielded output to meet and exceed the target, despite variations in the incoming material and minor instabilities within the process equipment.  Process control software enables the factory to increase capacity and yield while decreasing rework and scrap. It enables reduced production costs by lowering consumables, process engineering time and manufacturing cycle time. 
 Yield Management Software. Semiconductor manufacturers use yield management software (“YMS”) to obtain valuable process yield and equipment productivity information. The data necessary to generate productivity information comes from many different sources throughout the wafer fab: inspection and metrology systems, tool sensors, tool recipes, electrical tests and the fab environment. As the complexity and cost of manufacturing processes increase, the value of faster, better analysis to support critical manufacturing decisions grows. As a result, customers are demanding robust yield management systems that can analyze large, complex data sets quickly and effectively. Our fully integrated YMS is designed to analyze data from disparate sources and multiple sites to maximize productivity across the entire value chain.

involving technological innovation, productivity, total cost of ownership of the system, including impact on end of line yield, price, product performance and throughput capability, quality, reliability and customer support.
 Manufacturing
Our manufacturing operations are in Milpitas California, Tucson Arizona, Wilmington Massachusetts, Bloomington Minnesota, and at various contract manufacturers around the world. It is our strategy to outsource the assemblies that do not contain elements that we believe lead to a direct competitive advantage. Most of our automated and integrated products are currently manufactured at our Milpitas and Bloomington facilities. We currently do not expect our manufacturing operations to require additional major investments in capital equipment. 
 We manufacture key modular assemblies and integrated tools and make reasonable efforts to ensure that externally purchased parts or raw materials are available from multiple suppliers, if possible. Certain components, subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of our systems are obtained either from a sole supplier or limited group of suppliers. We also have long-term supply agreements with strategic suppliers for the supply of key assemblies for use in our products. 
 We rely on limited source suppliers for certain parts and subassemblies. This reliance creates a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, and reduced control over pricing and time of delivery of components. An inability to obtain adequate supplies would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or might require us to redesign our systems to accommodate different components or subassemblies. To date, we have not experienced any significant delivery delays. However, if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply, manufacture such components or subassemblies internally, or redesign our products, this could prevent us from shipping our products to our customers on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 Research and Development
We continue to invest in research and development to provide our customers with products that add value to their manufacturing processes and that provide a better and differentiated solution than our competitors so that our products stay in the forefront of current and future market demands. Whether it is for an advancement of current technology, yield and manufacturing improvement, enabling new end device technology, or the development of a new application in our core or emerging markets, we are committed to product excellence and longevity. 
 The markets for equipment and systems for manufacturing semiconductor devices and for performing OCD metrology, macro-defect inspection, advanced packaging lithography and thin film transparent and opaque process control metrology are characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations. We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products is critical to our success. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
 Intellectual Property
 We believe that our success will depend to a great degree upon innovation, technological expertise and our ability to adapt our products to new technology. As a result, we have a policy of seeking patents on inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research, development, and manufacturing activities. As of January 1, 2022, we have been granted, or hold exclusive licenses to 436 U.S. and foreign patents. The patents we own, jointly own or exclusively license have expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2040. We also have 80 pending patent applications in the United States and other countries. Our patents and patent applications principally cover various aspects of metrology, macro-defect detection and classification, altered material characterization, lithography techniques and automation. 
 Our pending patent applications may never be issued, and even if they are, these patents, our existing patents and the patents we license may not provide sufficiently broad protection to protect our intellectual property, or they may prove to be unenforceable. To protect our intellectual property, we also rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and licenses and non-disclosure agreements. There can be no assurance (i) that any patents or trademarks issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, (ii) that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage or (iii) that we will be able to fully protect our intellectual property. Additionally, others may obtain patents or trademarks and assert them against us. From time to time, we receive communications from third parties asserting that our systems, software and/or methods may contain features that such third parties claim may infringe upon their intellectual property rights. 
 From time to time, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation against other persons or entities to protect and/or enforce our intellectual property rights or contractual rights. However, litigation is costly and time consuming and there is no assurance that any lawsuit we bring will yield the result that we seek, as (i) the lawsuit may be dismissed or there could be an adverse finding, (ii) we may not be able to pursue the lawsuit due to the laws of the applicable country or (iii) there may be a subsequent

unfavorable change in the laws that limit our ability to pursue the lawsuit. There is a risk that our means of protecting our intellectual property may not be adequate. For example, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products.
Human Capital and Talent
As of January 1, 2022, we had approximately 1,411 staff globally, 367 in research and development, 270 in operations, 131 in administration and 643 in sales, applications and service support. A large percentage of our employees have technical backgrounds and undergraduate and/or advanced degrees. Many of our employees have specialized skills and experience that are of value to our business, products and services. Our future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain our highly skilled, technical, operational and managerial team members, who are in great demand in our industry and business communities.
 Approximately 62% of our employees are located in the United States, 35% in Asia Pacific and 3% in Europe. None of our employees are represented by a union and we have never experienced a work stoppage because of union actions. We consider our employee relations to be favorable. 
 Purpose and Culture. All of our employees are expected to uphold the following core values which are foundational to our culture:
  
• | Passion – ownership, pride and caring in our work
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Integrity – honesty, dependable, predictable and accountable
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collaboration – working together toward a common goal
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Results – meeting and exceeding goals, focused toward innovation and growth
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These core values define the way we do business in our everyday actions and choices. We strive to create a respectful work environment characterized by mutual trust and the absence of intimidation, oppression, discrimination and exploitation.
 Talent Development and Acquisition. Successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management and leadership teams. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We continuously evaluate, modify, and enhance our internal processes, tools and technologies to increase employee engagement, productivity, quality and efficiency. We offer employees access to internal and external training and development courses to support individual development. We review succession plans and focus on promoting internal talent to help grow our employees, both professionally and personally. 
 We are committed to promoting and cultivating an inclusive and diverse culture that welcomes and celebrates everyone without bias. In addition, we look to actively engage within our communities to foster and attain social equity.
 In order to ensure that we are meeting our human capital and talent objectives, we frequently utilize employee surveys to understand the effectiveness of our employee and Company programs and where we can improve across the Company. Our latest survey, completed during fiscal 2021, had a participation rate of over 77% of all our employees. Through the survey, our employees indicated that the Company’s greatest strengths include ensuring that employees know what is expected of them, providing a caring work environment, fostering an environment where employees have the opportunity to do their best and commitment to quality.  
 Compensation Philosophy. Our compensation philosophy creates the framework and building blocks for our rewards and recognition programs. We have a pay-for-performance culture that ties compensation to the performance of the individual and the Company. We provide balanced compensation programs that focus on the following five key elements:

• | Pay-for-performance - Reward those who achieve or exceed set goals and objectives, while also recognizing those making significant, impactful contributions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | External market based - Pay levels that are competitive with respect to the labor market in which we compete for talent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Internal equity - Providing fair compensation programs within the Company;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fiscal responsibility - Providing programs which can be responsibly supported by our operations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Legal compliance - Ensure compliance with the applicable laws of the states and countries in which we operate in all material respects.
