Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
References herein to “we”, “us”, “our”, “Company”, and “TreeHouse” refer to TreeHouse Foods, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context specifically states or implies otherwise.
 
We are a consumer packaged food and beverage manufacturer operating over 50 manufacturing facilities across the United States, Canada, and Italy servicing primarily retail grocery and food away from home customers. We manufacture a variety of shelf stable, refrigerated, fresh, and frozen products. We have a comprehensive offering of packaging formats and flavor profiles, and we also offer natural, organic, and preservative-free ingredients in many categories. 
 
The Company was incorporated on January 25, 2005 by Dean Foods Company to accomplish a spin-off of certain specialty businesses to its shareholders, which was completed on June 27, 2005. Since the Company began operating as an independent entity, it has expanded its product offerings through a number of strategic and bolt-on acquisitions.  Our strategy is to be the leading supplier of private label food and beverage products by providing the best balance of quality and cost to our customers. We manufacture and sell the following:
 
 
• | private label products to retailers, such as supermarkets, mass merchandisers, and specialty retailers, for resale under the retailers’ own or controlled labels,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | private label and branded products to the foodservice industry, including foodservice distributors and national restaurant operators,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | branded products under our own proprietary brands, primarily on a regional basis to retailers,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | branded products under co-pack agreements to other major branded companies for their distributions, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | products to our industrial customer base for repackaging in portion control packages and for use as ingredients by other food manufacturers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the first quarter of 2017, the Company completed changes in its organizational structure that resulted in a change in how the Company manages its business and allocates resources. Our reportable segments are now organized and managed by products: Baked Goods, Beverages, Condiments, Meals, and Snacks. Previously, our reportable segments were organized and managed by customer channels: North American Retail Grocery, Food Away From Home, and Industrial and Export. All prior period information has been recast to reflect this change.
 
Our reportable segments, and the product categories that make up each segment, are as follows:

Net sales are relatively evenly distributed across segments:
 
See Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information by segment.
 
On April 25, 2017, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its canned soup and infant feeding (“SIF”) business. The SIF business is based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and produced private label condensed and ready-to-serve soup, baby food, and gravies for the Meals segment. The transaction closed on May 22, 2017 and final working capital adjustments were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
On February 1, 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Ralcorp Holdings, Inc., the corporation through which the private brands business of ConAgra Foods, Inc. (“Private Brands Business”) was operated. The Private Brands Business is a leading manufacturer of private label refrigerated and shelf stable products in the bars, bakery, cereal, condiments, pasta, and snacks categories. Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. was renamed TreeHouse Private Brands, Inc. during the first quarter of 2016.
 
We operate our business as Bay Valley Foods, LLC (“Bay Valley”), Sturm, S.T. Foods, Cains, Associated Brands, Inc. (“Associated Brands U.S.”), Protenergy Natural Foods, Inc. (“Protenergy U.S.”), Flagstone Foods (“Flagstone”), TreeHouse Private Brands, Inc., American Italian Pasta Company, Nutcracker Brands, Inc., Linette Quality Chocolates, Inc., Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products, Inc., Cottage Bakery, Inc., and The Carriage House Companies, Inc. in the United States, E.D. Smith, Associated Brands, Inc. (“Associated Brands Canada”), Protenergy Natural Foods Corporation (“Protenergy Canada”), BFG Canada Ltd., and Western Waffles Corp in Canada, and Pasta Lensi in Italy. Bay Valley is a Delaware limited liability company, and a 100% owned subsidiary of TreeHouse. All operating units are directly or indirectly 100% owned subsidiaries of Bay Valley.
 
Customers and Distribution
 
We sell our products through various distribution channels, including grocery retailers, foodservice distributors, and industrial and export, which includes food manufacturers and repackagers of foodservice products. We have an internal sales force that manages customer relationships and a broker network for sales to retail, foodservice, and export accounts. Industrial food products are generally sold directly to customers without the use of a broker. Most of our customers purchase products from us either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that generally are terminable at will.
 
Products are shipped from our production facilities directly to customers, or from warehouse distribution centers where products are consolidated for shipment to customers if an order includes products manufactured in more than one production facility or product category. We believe this consolidation of products enables us to improve customer service by offering our customers a single order, invoice, and shipment. Some customers also pick up their orders at our production facilities or distribution centers.
 
We sell our products to a diverse customer base, including the leading grocery retailers and foodservice operators in the United States and Canada, and also a variety of customers that purchase bulk products for industrial food applications. We currently supply more than 200 retail food customers in North America, including over 50 of the 75 largest non-convenience food retailers.

A relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 60.6% of our consolidated net sales. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our largest customer, Walmart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 22.0%, 18.7%, and 20.7%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. Costco accounted for approximately 10.3% of consolidated net sales in 2017, with less than 10% in previous years. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net sales. Total trade receivables with Walmart Stores, Inc. and affiliates represented 21.8% and 18.6% of our total trade receivables as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total trade receivables with Costco represented approximately 6.4% of our total trade receivables as of December 31, 2017. The Company had revenues from customers outside of the United States of approximately 8.8%, 8.7%, and 11.9% of total consolidated net sales in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, with 6.8%, 6.9%, and 10.8% from Canada in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Sales are determined based on the customer destination where the products are shipped.
 
Backlog
 
We generally ship our products from inventory upon receipt of a customer order. In certain cases, we produce to order. Sales order backlog is not material to our business.
Competition
 
Our business faces intense competition from large branded manufacturers and highly competitive private label and foodservice manufacturers. In some instances, large branded companies presently manufacture, or in the past have manufactured, private label products. The industries in which we compete are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. Our customers do not typically commit to buy predetermined amounts of products, and many retailers utilize bidding procedures to select vendors.
 
We have several competitors in each of our channels. For sales of private label products to retailers, the principal competitive factors are product quality, quality of service, and price. For sales of products to foodservice, industrial, and export customers, the principal competitive factors are price, product quality, specifications, and reliability of service.
 
Competition to obtain shelf space for our branded products with retailers generally is based on the expected or historical performance of our product sales relative to our competitors. The principal competitive factors for sales of our branded products to consumers are brand recognition and loyalty, product quality, promotion, and price. Some of our branded competitors have significantly greater resources and brand recognition than we do.
 
Recent trends impacting competition include an increase in snacking and awareness of healthier and “better for you” foods. These trends, together with a surge of specialty retailers who cater to consumers looking for either the highest quality ingredients, unique packaging, products to satisfy particular dietary needs, or value offerings where consumers are looking to maximize their food purchasing power, create pressure on manufacturers to provide a full array of products to meet customer and consumer demand.
 
We believe our strategies for competing in each of our business segments, which include providing superior product quality, effective cost control, an efficient supply chain, successful innovation programs, and competitive pricing, allow us to compete effectively.
 

Trademarks
 
We own a number of registered trademarks. While we consider our trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not consider any trademark to be of such material importance that its absence would cause a material disruption of our business. No trademark is material to any one segment.
 
Trademarks used in the United States include the following pickle brands: Farman’s®, Nalley®, Peter Piper®, Schwartz® , and Steinfeld’s®. Trademarks related to sauces and syrups include Bennett’s®, Hoffman House®, Roddenbery’s Northwoods®, Saucemaker®, and San Antonio Farms®. Powdered coffee creamer is sold under our Cremora® trademark. Single serve hot beverages are sold under the Caza Trail® and Grove Square® trademarks. Snack nuts and trail mixes are sold under the Ann’s House of Nuts®, Amport®, and Goodfields® trademarks. Dry pasta is sold under the Golden Grain®, Anthony’s®, Luxury®, Ronco®, Mueller’s®, and Pennsylvania Dutch® trademarks. In-store bakery products are sold under the Lofthouse® trademark. Our jams and other sauces are sold under the E.D. Smith® and Habitant® trademarks. Branded oatmeal is sold under the McCann’s® trademark. Certain refrigerated dressings and sauces are sold under the Naturally Fresh® trademark. Additionally, certain mayonnaise, dressings, and sauces are sold under the Cains® and Olde Cape Cod® trademarks. Knox® gelatin and J-Cloth® cleaning cloths are brands sold in Canada.

Seasonality
 
In the aggregate, our sales are weighted slightly toward the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, with a more pronounced impact on profitability. As our product portfolio has grown, we have shifted to a higher percentage of cold weather products. Products that show a higher level of seasonality include non-dairy powdered creamer, coffee, specialty teas, cappuccinos, hot cereal, saltine and entertainment crackers, in-store bakery items, refrigerated dough products, and certain pasta products, all of which generally have higher sales in the first and fourth quarters. Additionally, sales of broth and snack nuts are generally higher in the fourth quarter. Warmer weather products such as dressings, pickles, and condiments typically have higher sales in the second quarter, while drink mixes generally show higher sales in the second and third quarters. As a result of our product portfolio and the related seasonality, our financing needs are generally highest in the second and third quarters due to inventory builds, while cash flow is highest in the fourth and first quarters following the seasonality of our sales.
 
Foreign Operations and Geographic Information
 
Foreign sales information is set forth in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Raw Materials and Supplies
 
Our raw materials consist of ingredients and packaging materials. Principal ingredients used in our operations include casein, cheese, cocoa, coconut oil, coffee, corn and corn syrup, cucumbers, eggs, fruit, non-fat dry milk, nuts (almonds, cashews, peanuts, and pecans), oats, palm oil, peppers, processed meats, rice, soybean oil, sugar, tea, tomatoes, and wheat (including durum wheat). These ingredients are generally purchased under supply contracts, and we occasionally engage in forward buying when we determine such buying to be to our advantage. We believe these ingredients generally are available from a number of suppliers. The cost of raw materials used in our products may fluctuate due to weather conditions, regulations, fuel prices, energy costs, labor disputes, transportation delays, political unrest, industry, general U.S., and global economic conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances. The most important packaging materials and supplies used in our operations are glass, plastic, corrugated containers, linerboard cartons, metal closures, metal cans, and composite cans. Most packaging materials are purchased under long-term supply contracts. We believe these packaging materials are generally available from a number of suppliers. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials and packaging supplies can adversely affect our performance, as price changes often lag behind changes in costs, and we are not always able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material and supply costs.
 
For additional discussion of the risks associated with the raw materials used in our operations, see Part 1, Item 1A – Risk Factors and Item 7 - Known Trends and Uncertainties.
 
Working Capital
 
Our short-term financing needs are primarily for financing working capital and are generally highest in the second and third quarters as inventory levels increase relative to other quarters, due to the seasonal nature of our business. As discussed in the Seasonality section, as our product portfolio has grown, we have shifted to a higher percentage of cold weather products, resulting in inventory builds in the second and third quarters, as the Company prepares for the fall and winter months. As a result of our product portfolio and the related seasonality, our financing needs are generally highest in the second and third quarters, while cash flow is highest in the fourth and first quarters following the seasonality of our sales. 
Research and Development
 
Research and development includes a variety of activities such as formula and recipe development, sample preparation, plant trials, ingredient evaluations, packaging material assessments and approvals, and other technology development and appraisals. These activities are focused on new product development, improvement of existing products, and packaging. Activities are conducted at centralized research and development facilities as well as most manufacturing facilities. Research and development expense totaled  $30.8 million, $29.6 million, and $14.3 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and is included in the General and administrative line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, our work force consisted of approximately 13,489 full-time employees, with 11,466 in the United States, 1,924 in Canada, and 99 in Italy.

Regulatory Environment and Environmental Compliance
 
The conduct of our businesses, and the production, distribution, sale, labeling, safety, transportation, and use of our products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets where we operate. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations that apply to our businesses.
 
We are subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business including laws relating to water consumption and treatment, air quality, waste handling and disposal, and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. We are committed to meeting all applicable environmental compliance requirements.
 
The cost of compliance with national and international laws does not have, and is not expected to have, a material financial impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
