ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
MGM Resorts International is referred to as the “Company,” “MGM Resorts,” or the “Registrant,” and together with its subsidiaries may also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” MGM China Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “MGM China.” Except where the context indicates otherwise, “MGP” refers to MGM Growth Properties LLC together with its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
MGM Resorts International is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1986 that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, owns and operates integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts across the United States and in Macau.
We believe we operate several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests. 
MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Substantially all of its assets are owned by and substantially all of its businesses are conducted through its subsidiary MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”). As of December 31, 2021, we lease the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield Park, and MGM Springfield pursuant to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. See Note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding MGP and the Operating Partnership, which we consolidate in our financial statements, and Note 18 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the master lease with MGP, which eliminates in consolidation. 
We lease the real estate assets of Bellagio pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and a venture that is 5% owned by such subsidiary and 95% owned by a subsidiary of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“BREIT”, and such venture, the “Bellagio BREIT Venture”). We lease the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and a venture that is 50.1% owned by a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership and 49.9% owned by a subsidiary of BREIT (such venture, the “MGP BREIT Venture”). We lease the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and funds managed by The Blackstone Group Inc. ("Blackstone"). Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of these leases.
Business Developments 
In recent years, in furtherance of our vision to be the world’s premier gaming entertainment company, we have implemented an asset-light business model, which has involved a comprehensive review of our owned real estate assets to find opportunities to monetize those assets efficiently and allow unlocked capital to be redeployed towards balance sheet improvements, new growth opportunities, and to return value to our shareholders. At the same time, we have continued to focus on key growth opportunities that align with our vision, particularly by investing in U.S. online sports betting and iGaming through BetMGM, expanding our digital capabilities, and seeking to diversify our Asia operations with development efforts in Japan.
As part of that business strategy, we have sought, and executed on, opportunities to invest in our growth areas, divest our real estate assets, and acquire, or enter into venture transactions with respect to the operations of integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts, including through the following transactions:
•In July 2018, we and Entain plc (“Entain”) formed BetMGM, LLC (“BetMGM”), a venture that is owned 50% by each party. In connection with its formation, we provided BetMGM with exclusive access to all of our domestic landbased and online sports betting, major tournament poker, and online gaming operations and Entain provided BetMGM with exclusive access to its technology in the United States.
•In January 2019, we acquired the real property and operations associated with Empire City Casino's racetrack and casino ("Empire City") for total consideration of approximately $865 million. Subsequently, MGP acquired 
Empire City’s developed real property from us and Empire City was added to the master lease between us and MGP. Refer to Note 4 and Note 18 for additional information.
•In March 2019, we entered into an amendment to the master lease between us and MGP with respect to improvements made by us related to the rebranding of the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas property (the “Park MGM Transaction”). Refer to Note 18 for additional information on this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation. 
•Additionally, in November 2019, Bellagio BREIT Venture was formed, which acquired the Bellagio real estate assets from us for total consideration of $4.25 billion, and leased such assets back to us pursuant to a lease agreement. Refer to Note 11 for additional information relating to the lease and Note 12 for the guarantee entered into in connection with the transaction.
•In December 2019, we completed the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land for $825 million. See Note 16 for additional information related to this transaction.
•On February 14, 2020, we completed a series of transactions (collectively the “MGP BREIT Venture Transaction”) pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to the newly formed MGP BREIT Venture in exchange for total consideration of $4.6 billion. See Note 1 for further discussion on the transaction and Note 12 for the guarantee entered into in connection with the transaction.
•In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with us for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas. Additionally, the master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and the annual cash rent under the MGP master lease was reduced by $133 million, as further discussed in Note 18. Refer to Note 11 for additional information relating to the lease.
•Also, on January 14, 2020, we, the Operating Partnership, and MGP entered into a waiver agreement pursuant to which approximately 30 million Operating Partnership units that we held were redeemed for $700 million on May 18, 2020 and approximately 24 million Operating Partnership units that we held were redeemed for $700 million on December 2, 2020. As a result, the waiver terminated in accordance with its terms. Refer to Note 1 for further information regarding this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation. 
•On March 4, 2021, we delivered a notice of redemption to MGP covering approximately 37 million Operating Partnership units that we held which was satisfied with aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, using cash on hand together with the proceeds from MGP's issuance of Class A shares. See Note 13 for information regarding this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.
•On August 4, 2021, we entered into an agreement with VICI Properties, Inc. (“VICI”) and MGP whereby VICI will acquire MGP in a stock-for-stock transaction (such transaction, the “VICI Transaction”). Pursuant to the agreement, MGP Class A shareholders will receive 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and we will receive 1.366 units of the new VICI operating partnership (“VICI OP”) in exchange for each Operating Partnership unit held by us. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP will redeem the majority of our VICI OP units for cash consideration of $4.4 billion. MGP’s Class B share that is held by us will be cancelled. As part of the transaction, we will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and approval by VICI stockholders (which was obtained on October 29, 2021). Refer to Note 1 for further information.
•On September 26, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas ("The Cosmopolitan") for cash consideration of $1.625 billion, subject to customary working capital adjustments.

Refer to Note 11 for discussion of the lease agreement.
•On September 28, 2021, we announced that we, together with our venture partner, ORIX Corporation ("ORIX"), were selected by Osaka as the region’s integrated resort partner. In December 2021, we and ORIX formed a venture, through which we will bid to develop one of Japan's first integrated resorts.
•On October 29, 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from us for cash consideration of $400 million and MGM Springfield was added to the MGP master lease between us and MGP through which MGP leases back the real property to a subsidiary of ours. Transactions with MGP, including transactions under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated in our consolidation of MGP. Refer to Note 18 for further discussion of the master lease with MGP.
•On December 13, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment, Inc.

For additional information relating to our acquisitions, divestitures, venture transactions, and other arrangements, including those referred to above, see “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as the notes to our consolidated financial statements specified above.
Financial Impact of COVID-19. See “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Description of our business and key performance indicators — Financial Impact of COVID-19” for more information about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our recovery. For a discussion of the risks to our business resulting from COVID-19, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions.”
Resort Operations 
General 
Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments, and repay debt financings.
Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature as all of our casino resorts, except as otherwise described related to the impact of COVID-19, typically operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Empire City, which operates 20 hours a day, every day of the year, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. Our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties. We also lease space to third-party retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities.
As of December 31, 2021, we have three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and MGM China, as generally described below. See Note 17 for detailed financial information about our reportable segments.
Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations
Las Vegas Strip Resorts. Las Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts: Aria (including Vdara) (upon acquisition in September 2021), Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York (including The Park), Excalibur, Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas) and Circus Circus Las Vegas (until the sale of such property in December 2019).
Regional Operations. Regional Operations consists of the following casino resorts: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New 
Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts; Empire City in Yonkers, New York (upon its acquisition in January 2019); and MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio (upon MGM’s acquisition of the operations from MGP in April 2019).
Over half of the net revenue from our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is typically derived from non-gaming operations, including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming amenities and the majority of the net revenue from our Regional Operations is typically derived from gaming operations. Although our domestic customer mix has changed in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our long-term strategy continues to be to market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes, which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.
Our casino operations feature a variety of slots and table games, and, through BetMGM, we offer online sports betting and iGaming in certain jurisdictions in the United States. In addition, we provide our premium players access to high-limit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere. 
MGM China
We own approximately 56% of MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”), the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and holds the related gaming subconcession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Although visitation during 2020 and 2021 was significantly reduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect the long-term future growth of the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.
Our current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China’s revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by MGM Grand Paradise, a subsidiary of MGM China. The Macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was granted by SJM Resorts S.A. ("SJMSA", formerly Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A.), which expires in June 2022. The Macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions, but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires, though additional casinos or gaming areas require government approval prior to commencing operations. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Macau Operations — The Macau government can terminate MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM Grand Paradise, exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022, or MGM Grand Paradise may be unsuccessful in obtaining a gaming concession when a new public tender is held by the Macau government, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.”
As discussed above, gaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to three different concessionaires and three subconcessionaires, of which a subsidiary of MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise, is a subconcessionaire. In 2019, the expiration of MGM Grand Paradise's subconcession term was extended from March 31, 2020 to June 26, 2022, consistent with the expiration of the other concessionaires and subconcessionaires. Pursuant to the current Macau gaming law, upon reaching the maximum duration of 20 years, the term of the concessions may be extended one or more times by order of the Chief Executive, which period may not exceed, in total, 5 years. On January 14, 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the content of a bill to amend Macau gaming law, which followed a 45-day public consultation process regarding draft amendment proposals that were issued in September 2021. Under the bill, the existing subconcessions will be discontinued and a maximum of six concessions will be awarded for a term to be specified in the concession contract that may not exceed 10 years and which may be extended by three years under certain circumstances. The bill is subject to debate and approval by the Macau Legislative Assembly. The approval of the new gaming law bill will precede the public tender for the awarding of new gaming concessions and to date the Macau Government has provided no indication as to whether the public tender will take place before expiry of the existing gaming concessions and subconcessions but acknowledged that it could consider the extension of the existing concessions and subconcessions beyond their current term if the public tender is held at a later date. Unless MGM Grand Paradise's gaming subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended, the casino area premises and gaming-related equipment subject to reversion will automatically be transferred to the Macau Government upon expiration, and MGM Grand Paradise will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. In addition, certain events relating to the loss, termination, rescission, revocation or modification of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming subconcession in Macau, where such events have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, properties, or results of operations of MGM China, taken as a whole, may result in a special put option triggering event under MGM China’s senior notes and an event of default under MGM China’s revolving credit facilities. MGM 
China continues to closely monitor developments regarding the retendering process or concession extensions including the issuance of guidance by the Macau Government. MGM China intends to respond proactively to all relevant Macau Government requirements when known relating to the retendering process. We cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the current term or that we will be able to obtain a gaming concession in a public tender; however, management believes that MGM Grand Paradise will be successful in obtaining a gaming concession when a public tender is held.
Corporate and Other 
We have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. Our unconsolidated affiliates include the ventures with BREIT, discussed elsewhere, and BetMGM. In September 2021, we completed the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in CityCenter held by Infinity World and now own 100% of the equity interest in CityCenter. Accordingly, we no longer account for our interest in CityCenter under the equity method of accounting, and we now consolidate CityCenter in our financial statements.

Customers and Competition 
Our properties operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, iGaming and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and internationally. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions — We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.”
Our primary methods of successful competition include:
•Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;
•Constructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premier dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities;
•Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;
•Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions; and
•Developing distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.
Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations
Our customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions, trade associations, and small meetings. We have a diverse portfolio of properties, which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our properties have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our properties during midweek and off-peak periods.
Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip Resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity and convention space offerings, or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.
Outside Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where location is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region. 
MGM China
The three primary customer bases in the Macau gaming market are VIP gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations. VIP gaming play has historically been sourced both internally and externally. Externally sourced VIP gaming play was obtained through external gaming promoters who assist VIP players with their travel and entertainment arrangements. Gaming promoters have been compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover-based commissions. In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. Unlike gaming promoters and in-house VIP players, main floor players do not receive commissions. The profit contribution from the main floor gaming operations has historically exceeded the VIP gaming operations due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. We offer amenities to attract players such as premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include both table games and slots to create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for premium main floor players’ use, as well as non-gaming amenities, such as The Mansion and MGM Cotai Emerald Villa to attract ultra-high end customers. 
VIP gaming at MGM China is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters currently purchase these nonnegotiable chips and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow us to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play. Gaming promoter commissions are currently based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate. They also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate, which can be applied to hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary 
customer-related expenses. Gaming promoter commissions are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. In-house VIP commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. 
In December 2021, we suspended operations with our primary gaming promoters. In January 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the content of a bill to amend the gaming law which includes some restrictions relating to gaming promoters, including: each gaming promoter can only exercise the activity of gaming promotion for one concessionaire, revenue sharing arrangements between concessionaires and gaming promoters are prohibited, gaming promoters are prohibited from having exclusive operation of casino reserved areas, and gaming promoters are restricted to only providing support to the concessionaires in the promotion of casino gaming activities through commissions. The bill is subject to debate and approval by the Macau Legislative Assembly. 
We have focused our business on main floor gaming operations and, accordingly, we do not expect VIP gaming operations to be a significant source of revenue in future years. The majority of MGM China's casino revenue has been provided by main floor gaming operations in recent years and we expect this customer base will be the primary source of growth in the future.
Our key competitors in Macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires. If the Macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the Cotai Strip.
We encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world including, but not limited to, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Australia, and Las Vegas. 
Marketing
Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs. We advertise on radio, television, internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of social media. We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities. Our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, and help build lasting customer relationships. 
MGM Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in both gaming and non-gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. In January 2022, we redesigned our loyalty program to expand the ways in which our customers can earn benefits. We also offer the Golden Lion Club for gaming focused customers, in addition to M life Rewards, at MGM China. The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level ensure that customers can progressively access the full range of services that the resorts provide. Our loyalty programs focus on building a rewarding relationship with our customers, encouraging members to increase both visitation and spend.
Strategy 
We strive to be a leader in the global gaming, entertainment and hospitality industry that delivers extraordinary entertainment across a portfolio of properties in the United States and Macau. The quality of our properties and amenities is evidenced by our success in winning numerous awards, both domestic and globally, including several Four and Five Diamond designations from the American Automobile Association, multiple Four and Five Star designations from Forbes Travel Guide and numerous certifications of our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts.
In order to achieve our vision of becoming the world's premier gaming entertainment company, we developed our strategic plan, which centers on four pillars:

•Strong People and Culture. Recruit, develop and retain the best talent. Foster a culture of diversity and inclusion. Invest in the employee experience. 
•Customer-Centric Model. Leverage a customer-centric model reinforced by a strong brand and deep customer insights to provide unmatched entertainment experiences for our guests and drive top-line growth.
•Operational Excellence. Operating model refinement to maximize operating efficiencies and expand margins. Enhancement of digital capabilities to strengthen customer loyalty. 
•Disciplined Capital Allocation to Maximize Shareholder Value. Pursuit of targeted, attractive ROI opportunities that align to our strategic vision. Focus on shareholder returns. Fortify balance sheet. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting rapidly changing environment, our strategic direction must allow for flexibility. The strategic plan was developed with the intent to regularly revisit, measure, and reevaluate for emerging opportunities.
In allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investments in our existing properties, strategic growth opportunities, debt repayment and shareholder returns. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns.
We regularly evaluate targeted opportunities that provide an attractive return on investment in domestic and international markets, including the ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities and accessing new markets for iGaming and online sports betting. We also leverage our management expertise and well-recognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of our brands are well-suited to new projects in both gaming and non-gaming developments. We may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties.
We continue to invest in our operating model by expanding the footprint of our Centers of Excellence and enabling best in class operations through adjustments within corporate and property business units. In addition, we have implemented several improvement and cost cutting initiatives comprised of labor, sourcing, and revenue programs that have further improved our operating model and have positioned us as a stronger company.
We have continued to focus on our key growth opportunities of developing an integrated resort in Japan and investing in BetMGM. In September 2021, we, together with our venture partner, ORIX, were selected by Osaka as the region’s integrated resort partner. This selection marks an important step in our long-term bid to develop one of Japan’s first integrated casino resorts. We are currently working with Osaka to submit an area development plan to the central government during the application period. As it relates to BetMGM, we believe that BetMGM is positioned as a long-term leader in the U.S. online sports betting and iGaming industries. As part of our commitment to the success of BetMGM, we have integrated our MGM Rewards program with BetMGM and have BetMGM branded on-property sportsbooks and kiosks to drive higher value customers at lower acquisition costs through a robust omni-channel strategy. Further, we continue to explore bringing full-scale commercial gaming to Empire City in New York.
Technology
We believe technology, digital and advanced data science/analytics capabilities are critical to optimizing customer experience and loyalty, employee productivity and engagement, operational efficiency and revenue growth. We are focused on using these capabilities to achieve specific goals of creating ‘only at MGM’ differentiation through unique content and experiences, establishing a perennial engagement with our guests for increased loyalty, digital diversification through enhanced e-commerce and seamless integration of the physical integrated resorts business with digital casino and sports betting businesses, creating cross-property experiences and promotions in Las Vegas to provide much better value to the consumer, enhancing our data driven decisioning capabilities in all aspects of our business for faster decision making, and optimizing our operations and employee productivity and experience through digitization. 
Environmental & Social Responsibility 
At MGM Resorts we have had a long-standing commitment to environmental and social responsibility. For over a decade, we have had a dedicated board committee focused on Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”). In 2019, we had bolstered governance of these topics by uniting our key pillars of Diversity and Inclusion, Philanthropy and Community Engagement and Environmental Sustainability under one Executive Committee-level leader who manages the MGM Resorts Social Impact and Sustainability Center of Excellence, reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President, and serves as liaison to the CSR and Sustainability board committee. This leader now also oversees the Human Resources function, and is thus able to integrate Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) considerations more deeply into the core culture of our organization.
The year 2021 was a critical one in terms of progress on our ESG initiatives. In May 2021, we published our 2020 Social Impact & Sustainability Report containing our most robust ESG disclosures to date. In this report we showed the significant progress made towards many of our ESG goals that we had announced publicly in prior reports, and we expect to publish a report in 2022 reflecting our progress on these goals during 2021. 
Importantly, 2021 saw the opening of the 100MW “MGM Resorts Mega Solar Array” in North Las Vegas. This is the hospitality industry’s largest direct-connect renewable electricity project world-wide and has significantly improved our trajectory to achieve our previously announced carbon reduction goals. In connection with the opening of this array, we enhanced our climate ambition by announcing two new 2030 goals: to cut global total operational carbon emissions by 
50%, and source 100% renewable electricity in the USA. Beyond the environmental benefits associated with the renewable electricity generated, the array will also help us hedge our electricity costs and reduce our exposure to price volatility risks. 
In 2021, we also made substantial progress against our commitment to aligning more of our ESG report disclosures to leading ESG frameworks by publishing our first ever disclosures informed by guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Hotels & Lodging and Casinos & Gaming Sector Standards. 
Our full list of ESG goals and performance against them are available in our 2020 Social Impact & Sustainability Report, available at mgmresorts.com/focused. The content on this website and report is for informational purposes only and such content is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Trademarks
Our principal intellectual property consists of trademarks for, among others, Aria, Vdara, Bellagio, The Mirage, Borgata, Mandalay Bay, MGM, MGM Grand, MGM Resorts International, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Beau Rivage and Empire City, all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the United States. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our trademark rights. 
Human Capital 
We are focused on fostering a people-driven culture exemplified by how we lead and uphold our core values, which in 2021 evolved to: captivate our audience, inspire excellence, champion inclusion, and win together, to create an engaged and diverse workforce. Our long-term people strategy is designed to enhance talent attraction and development to support business objectives, guest experience, community engagement, and financial goals. Our workforce development strategies support local hiring and developing a robust workforce in the local communities in which we operate through veteran support, community training and employment, fulfilling local hiring commitments (where applicable), and through internship and management development programs.
Growth and Development
We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed, now and in the future, to continue to be a premier employer of choice across the gaming, hospitality, and entertainment industries. We are committed to a culture of continuous learning where employees, at all levels, are engaged in developing their knowledge, skills, and abilities and we support the long-term career aspirations of our employees through education and professional/personal development. In 2021, we introduced several new learning and development initiatives focused on a broad range of employee segments. Except as otherwise temporarily impacted due to COVID-19, we offer tuition reimbursement, contribute toward student loan debt repayment, and have partnered with the Nevada System of Higher Education to allow employees to earn a degree online free of charge for all credit hours.
Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (“ED&I”)
Our approach to ED&I is anchored by our corporate and people strategies and a social impact and sustainability approach that centers on embracing humanity and protecting the planet. A concise framework lays out four strategic pillars to guide our work: invest in people; build an inclusive culture; grow business and customer engagement and supplier diversity; and, enhance marketplace leadership and community relations. As part of our commitment, we have committed to the following four long-range goals: (1) ensure that all employees have equal access to leadership opportunities, (2) spend at least 10% of our biddable procurement with diverse suppliers, (3) expand our Supplier Diversity Mentorship Program to achieve 50 graduates and (4) train 100% of management employees on social impact policies and goals. In connection with each goal, we have established robust key performance indicators, which are tracked and published in our annual Social Impact and Sustainability Report.In addition, we have detailed internal Human Capital workforce reports, which include demographic and diversity data, and are reviewed with the Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Committee of the Board, leadership teams and executive management on a regular basis. 
Internally, we use multiple channels to facilitate communication and to continuously advance our core value of inclusiveness. The channels include but are not limited to open forums with executives, employee engagement surveys with detailed action planning, and employee network groups.
Work in the area of equity, diversity and inclusion is advanced through a range of programs and initiatives which include education and training, community partnerships, recruitment and talent development, advocacy, engagement and outreach. Responsibility is driven and led by the Company’s Chief People, Inclusion and Sustainability Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President, and is supported by a centralized diversity and inclusion team and the Human Resources department.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
In order to promote our culture of overall employee health and wellness we provide benefits, tools and resources to help maintain or improve physical, mental, and financial health. We continue to align benefit offerings to the needs of a diverse workforce across an expanded regional presence and leverage innovative solutions to expand access to health and wellness resources, including the recent addition of a service to help connect LGBTQIA+ people and their loved ones with culturally and clinically competent health care providers.
To ensure our employees' continued health, safety, and wellness in response to COVID-19, we coordinated with medical experts to put in place extensive testing protocols for our employees and required COVID-19 vaccination as a condition of employment for all salaried employees and new hires throughout the United States. As a commitment to our employees impacted by the pandemic, we have maintained benefits eligibility for many employees who were furloughed in 2020 and were unable to work enough hours to qualify for benefits until business conditions improved. 
Community Engagement and Philanthropy
Our philanthropic focus centers around: Embracing Humanity and Protecting the Planet. We organize our major programs and initiatives under the pillars of caring for one another and investing in the community. We established the MGM Resorts Foundation in 2002 as an engagement opportunity for employees to contribute to charitable causes, which provides two types of grants (1) the Employee Emergency Grant, which benefits our employees, and (2) the Community Grant, which benefits local communities. We endeavor to care for our communities through volunteerism and philanthropy and encourage all of our employees to volunteer through a variety of programs. In addition, we offer opportunities for our employees to give back to their communities, including through programs such as VolunteerREWARDS, which provides employees with opportunities to earn grant money to their charity of choice based on volunteer hours. 
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 42,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees domestically. In addition, we had approximately 10,000 employees at MGM China. We had collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 35,000 of our employees as of December 31, 2021. Collective bargaining agreements covering multiple bargaining units at our Regional Operations and Las Vegas Strip Resorts are scheduled to expire in 2022. This includes all bargaining units at Gold Strike Tunica in Mississippi, all bargaining units at Borgata in Atlantic City, our hotel/food & beverage bargaining unit at MGM National Harbor, and all valet operations in Las Vegas (with the exception of The Signature). Negotiations for successor contracts covering those employees are being scheduled as expiration dates approach and will continue throughout 2022. As of December 31, 2021, none of the employees of MGM China are part of a labor union and the MGM China resorts are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. 
Government Regulation and Licensing 
The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. 
A more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference. 
Our businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes (including regulations under 
the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities), construction, land use and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. 
In addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations.
For a discussion of potential risks to our business relating to regulatory matters, including due to the potential impact of legislative and regulatory changes, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Changes in Public Policy.”
