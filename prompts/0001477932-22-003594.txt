Industry Analysis/Competition

Market Analysis 

The Company is well positioned with the build out of its innovative payment technology and believes with the domination of ecommerce, decriminalization of certain products, not to mention launch of very innovative platforms like web3 and blockchain the payments industry is ripe for disruption because the sheer numbers of new, underbanked businesses are exploding. Management believes that traditional banking is antiquated, unable, unwilling to work with the inherent risk that comes with any innovative company pushing the boundaries of a new way to pay for goods and services. The everyday merchant is tired of high fees, friendly fraud, cryptic algorithms, reserves, chargebacks and lack of trust with current institutions while the consumer is levied service charges and fees for mediocre service. Management believes that both the merchant and its consumers are very open to new payment technologies that allow for ease of in person and online purchases in a very secure environment and high level of trust with its launch of Pay with Deb and relaunch of its Tendercard gift card closed loop payment technologies.
