 Item 1. Business
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise dictates, references to “Resideo”, “the Company”, “we,” “us” or “our” means Resideo Technologies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 This Annual Report includes industry and market data that we obtained from various third-party industry and market data sources. While we believe the projections of the industry sources referenced in this Annual Report are reasonable, forecasts based upon such data involve inherent uncertainties, and actual results are subject to change based upon various factors beyond our control. All such industry data is available publicly or for purchase and was not commissioned specifically for us. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding any market, industry or similar data presented herein, forecasts based upon such data involve inherent uncertainties, and actual results regarding the subject matter of such forecasts are subject to change based upon various factors, including those beyond our control and those discussed under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” in this Annual Report.
 On October 29, 2018, we separated from Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”), becoming an independent publicly traded company as a result of a pro rata distribution of our common stock to shareholders of Honeywell (the “Spin-Off”). Our common stock began trading “regular way” under the ticker symbol “REZI” on the NYSE on October 29, 2018.
 Description of Business
 Resideo is a leading global manufacturer and developer of technology-driven products and solutions that provide critical comfort, residential thermal and security solutions to over 150 million homes globally. We are also the leading wholesale distributor of low-voltage security products including intrusion, access control and video products and participate significantly in the broader related markets of smart home, fire, power, audio, ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity, and structured wiring products. In our newly established Vision and Purpose, we imagine a world where homes and buildings are good for the planet, where technology works to simplify everyday life. In that world, people are healthy, happy, and secure. To create this future, we work every day to simplify the connected world so people have peace of mind and can focus on what matters most.
 We have a global footprint serving commercial and residential end markets. Our primary focus is on the professional channel where we are a trusted partner to over 110,000 professional installers. Our global scale, breadth of product offerings, innovation heritage, and differentiated service and support has enabled our trusted relationship with professional installers and has been a key driver of our success. Leveraging our underlying strengths, we are transforming our business with a strategy that includes operational improvements, product innovation, and investments to drive future growth and value creation. We believe our significant presence in the home, both on the wall and behind the wall, positions us well for the value and convenience consumers will expect out of the connected home in the future.
We operate in large markets that sit at the intersection of multiple secular growth trends. We believe the increased desire for critical comfort, residential thermal, and security solutions in the home, combined with the long-term impacts of working from home, are driving investment in the home both in terms of time and dollars. We believe our total addressable market represents approximately a $122 billion inclusive of $32 billion for our comfort, residential thermal solutions and security, and $90 billion for distribution of low-voltage security products and additional adjacent products, including intrusion and smart home, fire, video surveillance, access control, power, audio and video, ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity and structured wiring. At the same time, the ability to better understand the functioning of a home through sensors, systems and controls, and connectivity has created a large and fast-growing connected home market. According to Statista, the global connected home market is expected to grow at a 17% compounded annual growth rate from $68 billion in 2019 to $208 billion in 2026. To date, we believe this market has been primarily composed of point products and services from a wide variety of industry participants, creating significant complexity for consumers. Given this complexity, we believe a significant opportunity exists to provide products, solutions and services to consumers and professional installers that integrate the disparate sensors, systems and controls inside the home, and enable differentiated insight.
RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
We deliver value to our customers via two business segments, Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution, which respectively contributed 42.2% and 57.8% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
 Products & Solutions: Our comfort, residential thermal, and security products and solutions have a presence in over 150 million homes globally and benefit from the trusted, well-established Honeywell Home brand as well as key branded offerings such as Resideo, Braukmann, and others. Our offerings include temperature and humidity control, thermal water and air solutions, as well as security panels, sensors, peripherals, wire and cable, communications devices, video cameras, awareness solutions, cloud infrastructure, installation and maintenance tools, and related software. We are a leading player across the majority of our product categories with 15 million systems installed annually. Through our whole home presence on the wall and behind the wall, we are an enabler of home connectivity with approximately 9.4 million connected customers. Our connected solutions harness this data to provide control, visibility, insights, and alerts to the end user. Our comprehensive product suite has also allowed us to develop and sustain a long-standing partnership with professional installers who have relied on our selection and availability of products and configured solutions to help them succeed for over 100 years. Our broad portfolio of innovative products is delivered through a comprehensive network of over 110,000 professional contractors, more than 3,000 distributors and over 1,200 original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), as well as major retailers and online merchants.
 ADI Global Distribution: Our ADI Global Distribution segment is the leading wholesale distributor of low-voltage security products including intrusion, access control and video products, and participates significantly in the broader related markets of smart home, fire, access control, power, audio, ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity, and structured wiring products. Through nearly 200 stocking locations in 16 countries, ADI Global Distribution distributes more than 350,000 products from over 1,000 manufacturers to a customer base of over 100,000 contractors and is recognized for superior customer service. We believe this global footprint gives us distinct scale and network advantages in our core products over our competitors. Further, we believe our customers derive great value from the advice and recommendations of our knowledgeable design specialists, allowing our customers to better meet the technical and systems integration expertise requirements to install and service professional security systems. We continue to be a leader in the industry with value-added services including presales system design, 24/7 order pick-up, and the selective introduction of new product categories such as professional audio-visual.
Competition
 Our industries and markets are highly competitive in both our Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution segments, where we compete with global, national, regional and local providers for our products, services and solutions, including manufacturers, distributors, service providers, retailers and online commerce providers, as well as newer entrants to the market with non-traditional business and customer service models or disruptive technologies and products, including cable, telecommunications, and large technology companies competing in the connected home space.
 Factors influencing our competitive position in the industry include product and service innovation, our reputation and the reputation of our brands, sales and marketing programs, product performance, reliability and warranty, quality and breadth of product training and events, product availability, speed and accuracy of delivery, service and price, technical support, and credit availability.
 Business Strategy
 Our management team has significant experience and a track record of leading tech-enabled businesses, developing best-in-class products, and executing organizational change. This team is focused on ingraining a culture of continuous improvement into our organization with the goal of lowering costs, increasing margins and positioning the Company for growth. Leveraging our presence in the home and its relationship with professional installers, management has repositioned the Products & Solutions business to enhance focus and collaboration across business lines and drive products and services innovation.
 With ongoing transformation underway, we believe we are well positioned to execute on our growth strategy across both of our segments. Our strategy in Products & Solutions is focused on accelerating our product innovation,
RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
expanding our presence in the home and buildings, and over time, enabling connected ecosystems and services grounded in relationships with professional installers. Our ADI Global Distribution growth strategy is focused on increasing our omni channel presence to grow our customer base, expanding into adjacent growth markets, and continuing to enhance our value-add services to support our professional installers’ efficiency and profitability.
Materials and Suppliers
 Purchased materials in our manufacture of products include copper, steel, aluminum, plastics, printed circuit boards, semiconductors, and passive electronics. Purchased materials cover a wide range of supplier value-add, from raw materials and single components to subassemblies and complete finished goods, and there are considerable expenditures on both commercial off-the-shelf and make-to-print items. Although execution of material substitutions or supplier changes may be resource intensive and can cause delays and other inefficiencies, alternatives usually exist in the event that a supplier becomes unable to provide material. Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, and catastrophic events can increase the cost and effect the supply of our products and services, and impact our ability to meet commitments to customers. During 2021, we experienced global shortages in key materials and components in certain instances impacting our ability to supply certain products as well as materials price inflation and increased freight costs. In 2022, material prices and availability are likely to fluctuate throughout the year and could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Manufacturing
 Our Products & Solutions business operate manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world, including sites in Mexico, Czech Republic, Hungary, the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Netherlands and China. A significant percentage of our Products & Solutions revenue is derived from products manufactured in our own facilities, with the remainder being “buy to sell” (finished products purchased directly from other manufacturers) or sourced from third-party contract manufacturers. Major activities and competencies in our manufacturing operations include printed circuit board (PCB) assembly, surface mount technologies (SMT), automatic and manual assembly and test, electrotechnical assembly and test, die casting and machining, calibration and final test. We source raw materials and commodities, electronic components and assemblies, and mechanical components and assemblies from a wide range of third-party suppliers worldwide.
Regulatory and Environmental Compliance and Regulatory Capital Expenditures
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to environmental health and safety protection standards and permitting, labeling and other requirements regarding, among other things, electronic and wireless communications, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials, remediation of environmental contamination, data privacy, consumer protection, licensing, working conditions for and compensation of our employees and others. Our businesses may also be affected by changes in governmental regulation of energy efficiency and conservation standards, product safety regulations, and consumer privacy and protection regulations. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect the Company’s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 
The Company’s efforts to comply with numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations applicable to its business and products often results in capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2021, we have recorded a liability for environmental investigation and remediation of approximately $22 million related to sites owned and operated by Resideo. The Company makes capital expenditures to design and upgrade its products to comply with or exceed standards applicable to the industries in which it competes. The Company’s ongoing environmental compliance programs also results in capital expenditures. Regulatory and environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions; however, expenditures in 2021 related solely to regulatory compliance were not material. It is management’s opinion that the amount of any future capital expenditures related to compliance with any individual regulation or grouping of related regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial results or competitive position in any one year. See Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of environmental matters.

RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 13,300 employees in 32 countries. About 3,300 employees were located in the United States, and the remaining ~10,000 employees were located primarily in Mexico, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. Approximately 170 employees in the U.S. were subject to collective bargaining, with ~1,000 additional employees outside of the U.S. subject to collective bargaining. We believe overall our relations with our workforce are good.
   Health and Safety: The Company’s commitment to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all employees continued throughout 2021. The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has meant our previously developed strategies to protect our employees and customers have remained in place. These actions included formation of a response team, contact tracing and tracking of exposure and positive cases, enhanced cleaning protocols, moving to work from home where possible, suspension of most business travel and in-person meetings, the purchase of face coverings, gloves, hand sanitizer, and hand held scanning devices, installation of thermal scanners at our manufacturing sites, installation of floor demarcations and plastic shields in our ADI branches and on manufacturing lines, weekly internal audits, leasing of additional vans to permit distancing where we provide transportation to employees, daily symptom self-assessments, enhanced employee benefits, and policies requiring face coverings and physical distancing. In addition, we took several actions to promote employees obtaining the COVID-19 vaccine, including a social media campaign, providing a donation to a non-profit for each employee who reported they had been vaccinated, providing schedule flexibility and paid time off to employees to obtain the vaccine, providing transportation to vaccine clinics and holding vaccine clinics for employees at certain sites. In the United States, we also tracked status and prepared for implementation of executive orders regarding vaccinations and weekly testing. For a more detailed description of the potential impact of COVID on the Company’s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
    At the end of 2021 our global Total Case Incident Rate or “TCIR” (the number of occupational injuries and illnesses per 100 employees) was 0.48, which was significantly lower than the North American Industry Classification System injury rate for Automatic Environmental Controls of 1.4 (as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). We monitor our safety through a balanced scorecard of key performance indicators. In addition to reactive incident management investigation and root cause analysis indicators, we measure and analyze the data generated from our hazard observation, designated HSE inspections by line managers and internal audit programs by accredited HSE lead auditors to provide insights and intelligence that help us proactively mitigate issues before they result in incidents.
   Total Rewards: Our primary reward strategy is ensuring “pay-for-performance” on an annual basis, as well as over the long term, which drives a mindset of accountability and productivity. Our compensation guiding principles are to structure compensation that is simple, aligned and balanced. We structure and administer our rewards programs in a manner consistent with good governance practices. We believe that the interests of employees must be aligned with our shareholders. We provide comprehensive, competitive and contemporary benefits that recognize the diversity of our workforce and are designed to meet the varying needs of our employees and promote choice. Our package includes paid time off, flexible work schedules, education assistance programs and more.
   These actions reinforce our culture that values employees and seeks to attract and retain the talent that we need to win in the market. We believe the combination of our competitive pay-for-performance compensation programs and our comprehensive benefit programs demonstrate our commitment to a compelling total rewards value proposition for our employees.
    Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: The Company is committed to creating a diverse, equitable and inclusive working environment. We maintain employee resource groups (ERGs) across six categories: Women, LGBTQIA+, Black, Latino, Veterans, and People with Differing Abilities. Each ERG is sponsored and supported by a senior leader of the company and our ERGs have held conversations with our executive leadership to discuss ideas for improving our culture of inclusion. Each ERG has increased membership in 2021. Our corporate functions and business units continue to track progress with respect to our diversity and inclusion initiatives.
     Diversity is a core component of our recruiting strategy. Our diversity outreach includes contacting various categories of diversity job boards, including HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities). Diversity is a key component of service level agreements we maintain with our RPO (recruiting process outsourcing) partners to
RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
ensure they are accountable and meet our sourcing standards. This year we rolled out diverse slate guidelines for our career level 5+ roles requiring that interview slates include female and/or racially/ethnically diverse candidates, except in rare circumstances. We partnered with an RPO vendor to deliver training on mitigating bias in hiring for our people managers.
    Talent Acquisition, Management and Development: We have a robust recruiting model to attract all levels of talent across the regions where we operate. In 2021, our average time to fill open roles was 44 days, and we hired 4,000 employees, of which approximately 2,600 were production workers.  We continue to leverage our virtual interviewing platforms and onboarding experience to mitigate COVID-19 risk. Internally, strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur on an annual basis, globally and across all business areas.
   In 2021, we launched another cycle of our Employee Voice Survey. This survey allows each function in our company to see its ratings across three levers: Motivation, Ability, and Knowledge of Expectations. Our score for the 2021 cycle was 7.6 on a 10-point scale, with an employee Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 26, an increase of 3 points over last year, on a scale ranging from -100 to +100 (based on industry standards for employee NPS, any score above 10 is considered good). Each sub-organization is tasked with creating an action plan based on feedback received.
   Managers and their team members continue to participate in quarterly “Pulse” conversations to set performance expectations and monitor and evaluate performance. People managers at Resideo are strongly encouraged to give frequent, informal feedback so that employees are always clear on their performance level. We strongly believe in the importance of the role that people managers play and continue to provide quarterly people manager trainings. In 2021, we also created a Learning Community for our people managers, which is a space for them to easily access a multitude of trainings that can help them enhance their skills.
     To better support the development of our employees, we invested in a new mentorship platform that makes more effective pairings, provides developmental resources for both mentors and mentees, and facilitates a natural progression of a mentoring relationship through detailed session agendas. Our program has just under 400 members in paired mentorships, and the standard mentorship length is 6 months – 1 year.
   In order to better assist our employees in developing a career plan at Resideo, we have launched an interactive Career Navigator. This resource includes an opportunity map for employees to learn more about different functions and sub-functions as well as which skills and competencies are required to succeed in them.
   We believe that making investments in our future leaders will improve our bench strength and have partnered with CrossLead to develop the Resideo Leadership Academy (RLA). Up and coming leaders have been chosen to participate in this program, which will officially launch in the second quarter of 2022. Participants will learn from our executive leaders and CrossLead instructors, following the “Team of Teams” methodology taught by CrossLead. Participants in this program will also work on group 'stretch' projects together that solve important company needs while simultaneously allowing them to put their learnings from the RLA into practice.
    Culture: In 2021, we redefined our culture to better fit our current workforce and company strategy. We updated our vision and purpose statements and identified new leadership competencies. We moved from our previous four 'Energies' to 'Values,':

Start with the Customer: We understand our customers’ needs and pride ourselves on delivering exceptional experiences.
 
Act as One Team: We work together toward common goals, engaging from a place of humility and respect.

Pioneer the Future: We embrace change, boldly step into the unknown, and relentlessly foster innovation to fuel our growth.
 
Make a Difference: We care about the long-lasting, positive impact we make on each other, our customers, our communities, and the planet.

RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
In order to effectively operationalize these new values into our culture, we overhauled our internal and external materials to reflect these new changes, incorporated these values into our staffing materials and processes, re-vamped our recognition program, and created leadership materials for the transition.
Seasonality
 Our Products & Solutions business experiences a moderate level of seasonality. Sales activity is generally highest in the fall and early winter months, reflecting increased customer purchases of heating related products with the highest sales at the end of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter in the majority of our geographical markets.
Research and Development and Intellectual Property
 We have software centers of excellence in Austin, Texas; Bengaluru, India; and Melville, New York, along with major product design centers in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In addition, our laboratories are certified to meet various industry standards, such as FCC and UL, enabling us to test and certify products internally. We also have a user experience design group that consists of researchers and product and user experience designers aligned with development sites with the primary studios in Golden Valley, Minnesota. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 926 engineers.

Our deep domain expertise, proprietary technology and brands are protected by a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements, and contractual provisions. We own approximately 2,300 worldwide active patents and pending patent applications to protect our research and development investments in new products and services. We have and will continue to protect our products and technology by asserting our intellectual property rights against third-party infringers. See Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. We also have a significant trademark license with Honeywell in connection with our use of the Honeywell Home trademark as well as certain intellectual property licensed by Honeywell to us in connection with the Spin-Off. For a more detailed description of the various intellectual property rights and relationships that affect the Company’s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors
You should carefully consider all of the information in this Form 10-K and each of the risks described below, which we believe are the material risks that we face.
 Any of these risks, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10-K.
 The following risk factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance and should not be considered to represent a complete set of all potential risks that could affect us.
 Risks Relating to Our Business
 We operate in highly competitive markets; we may have competition for acquisitions and may not achieve our integration goals with acquired businesses.
 We operate in highly competitive markets in both our Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution segments and compete directly with global, national, regional, and local providers of our products, services and solutions including manufacturers, distributors, service and software providers, retailers, and online commerce providers. The most significant competitive factors we face are product and service innovation, reputation of our Company and brands, sales and marketing programs, product performance, warranty, quality of product training and events, product availability, speed and accuracy of delivery, price, customer and technical support, and furnishing of customer credit, with the relative importance of these factors varying among our segments and their respective products and services.
In addition to current competitive factors, there have been, and in the future, there may be new market entrants with non-traditional business, new business and customer service models or disruptive technologies and products, resulting in increased competition and changing business dynamics. Examples of these include cable, telecommunications and large technology companies competing in the connected home and home security spaces, utilities expanding their role in the provision of home energy services, OEMs vertically integrating, and the expansion of direct-to-consumer, retail and e-tail distribution in competition with our ADI Global Distribution business. Existing or future competitors may seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, or shifting business models to a software-based model, and we may be required to lower prices or may lose business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, to the extent that we do not meet changing customer preferences or demands or other market changes, or if one or more of our competitors introduces new products or services, becomes more successful with private label products, online offerings or establishes exclusive supply relationships, our ability to attract and retain customers could be adversely affected.
To remain competitive, we will need to invest continually in product and services development, marketing, customer service and support, manufacturing and our distribution networks. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments and we may be unable to maintain our competitive position including due to the fact that our competitors and potential competitors may have greater brand recognition, resources, access to capital, including greater research and development or sales and marketing funds, more customers, lower costs and more advanced technology platforms, particularly with our products and services in connected services and in new geographic regions. It is possible that competitive pressures resulting from consolidation, including customers taking manufacturing or distribution in house, purchasing directly from a manufacturer instead of from ADI Global Distribution, moving to a competitor, partnering with third parties and consolidation amongst our customers, could affect our growth and profit margins.
Some of our competitors may also be able to deliver their service solutions more quickly to market than we can by capitalizing on technology developed in connection with their substantial existing service models. In addition,
RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
some of our competitors have significant bases of customer adoption in other services and in online content, which they could use as a competitive advantage in the growing connected home solutions services market or otherwise in our product or distribution businesses. The expansion by large technology companies into connected home solutions, could result in pricing pressure, a shift in customer preferences towards the services of these companies and a reduction in our market share. In addition, in order to successfully compete, our products often need to integrate with the platforms of our competitors, who may be able to focus more on their own solutions versus ours, which may make it difficult to compete for the consumer market.
 Our Products & Solutions business' offerings are primarily sold through a network of professional contractors, distributors, OEMs, retailers and online merchants. Growth of the retail markets and greater e-tail distribution alternatives relative to the professional installation markets may negatively impact our sales and margins, which could negatively affect our cash flow and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.
 With respect to our ADI Global Distribution business, if retail outlets, including online commerce or big box stores increase their participation in wholesale distribution markets, or if buying patterns for our products become more retail or e-commerce based through these outlets than they currently are, our ADI Global Distribution business may not be able to effectively compete, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 Technology in our markets is changing rapidly and our future results and growth are largely dependent upon our ability to develop and successfully market new technologies and products and develop and protect the intellectual property related thereto as well as defend against the intellectual property threats of others.
 Technology in our markets changes constantly, as new technologies and enhancements to existing technologies continue to be introduced both in our traditional and connected product markets. Our future results depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, in part by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, as well as through the use of intellectual property protections such as patents and trade secrets, (iii) grow our market share, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, (v) find and effectively partner with and continue to partner with home connected device platforms and (vi) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. Our inability to predict the growth of and respond in a timely way to customer preferences and other developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of some business opportunities. As a result, we may be required to change our plans or acquire necessary intellectual property rights, which could be costly. Furthermore, our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in emerging markets may be limited by legal or practical considerations that have not historically affected our business in markets with more established intellectual property protection systems.
Our industry experiences significant intellectual property litigation and we could become involved in costly and lengthy litigation involving patents or other intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business. We have received allegations of patent infringement from third parties, including both operating companies and non-practicing entity patent holders, as well as communications from customers requesting indemnification for allegations brought by third parties. These have resulted in ongoing patent litigation relating to our combustion and comfort products and may continue to result in new litigation. These proceedings could subject us to significant liability, harm our ability to compete, and can divert our management’s time and attention. Often, we receive offers to license patents for our use. Such offers typically relate to various technologies including electronics, the “internet of things”, “connected homes”, power systems, controls, and software, as well as, the use of certain wireless networking methods, and the design of specific products. We believe that we will be able to access any necessary rights through licensing, cross-licensing, or other mutually beneficial arrangements, although to the extent we are required but unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable economic terms, it could adversely impact us, requiring us to take specific actions including ceasing using, selling or manufacturing certain products, services or processes or incurring significant costs and time delays to develop alternative technologies or re-design products.
 Our operations depend upon third-party technologies, software, and intellectual property. Failure to renew contracts with existing providers or licensors of technology, software, intellectual property or connectivity solutions, or to contract with other providers or licensors on commercially acceptable terms or at all, as well as any failure by such third-party provider to provide such technology solutions may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also be subjected to claims of infringement regardless of our lack of involvement in the development of the licensed technology. Although a third-party licensor is typically obligated to indemnify us if the licensed technology infringes on another party’s intellectual property rights, such indemnification is typically limited in amount and may be worthless if the licensor becomes insolvent.
 We rely on certain suppliers of products, materials and components and are otherwise subject to raw material price and supply variability with our suppliers which may impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.
 Both of our business segments depend on third parties for the supply of certain materials and components for products we manufacture and those manufactured on our behalf, or sold through our ADI Global Distribution business, some of which are supplied by single or limited source suppliers/manufacturers. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been and could continue to be adversely affected by disruptions in supply from our third-party suppliers and manufacturers, whether due to work stoppages, component failures, material inflation, natural disasters, pandemics, economic, political, financial or labor concerns, weather conditions affecting products or shipments or transportation disruptions or other reasons, or if suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition or otherwise. For example, there is currently a global semiconductor supply shortage. While our supply chain team has been diligently working to help ensure surety of supply, we have experienced instances where our third-party suppliers and manufacturers have failed to deliver materials, products, parts and components on time and at reasonable prices, and we have had and could continue to have difficulties fulfilling our orders or stocking our distribution centers on similar terms or at all. Sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged if these trends continue. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements has been and may continue to be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead-time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. In addition, terminations of supply or services agreements or a change in terms or conditions of sale from one or more of our key manufacturers could negatively affect our ADI Global Distribution’s operating margins, net revenue or the level of capital required to fund operations.

Manufacturers who currently distribute their products through our ADI Global Distribution business may decide to shift to or substantially increase their existing distribution with other distributors, their own dealer networks, or directly to resellers or end-users. This could result in more intense competition as distributors strive to secure distribution rights with these manufacturers, which could have an adverse impact on our ADI Global Distribution business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our ADI Global Distribution business may not be able to acquire from manufacturers certain product lines that we are interested in adding to our distribution business, and if even we are able to add products, they may not result in sales as expected and may not be profitable to the overall business.
 Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price may be materially adversely impacted by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.
Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and stock price may be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 (including newly discovered variants) virus pandemic as described in this Annual Report, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This outbreak has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the global economy. While we endeavor to continue to comply with all applicable health and sanitation and legal requirements, it is possible we may fail to keep up with ever changing required health and safety protocols. We cannot ensure uninterrupted operations in geographical areas impacted by COVID-19, and similar to many employers could experience a decline in the number of available workers, which could impact productivity. Deterioration in economic conditions could reduce our sales and profitability. Any financial distress of our customers due to deterioration in economic conditions or lack of continued governmental funding and support of our customers could result in reduced sales and decreased collectability of accounts receivable which could negatively impact our results of operations. The COVID-19 outbreak has had, and could continue to have, an impact on our ability to obtain certain of the raw materials, parts and components we need to manufacture our products as our suppliers face disruptions in their businesses, and disruptions to other aspects of our business. We depend greatly on our suppliers for items that are essential to the manufacturing of our products. If our suppliers fail to meet our manufacturing needs, it could delay our production and our product shipments to customers and negatively affect our operations. While we are considered as an essential product and service provider pursuant to laws, rules and regulations in the majority of regions in which we operate, which has generally provided us with the ability to continue to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be subject to changing laws, rules and regulations, and limitations on the scope of essential businesses, which may impact our ability to operate in such regions. In addition, we have in the past and may continue in the future during the pendency of the coronavirus pandemic, been subject to government inspections of our manufacturing facilities to confirm compliance with government regulations related to employee health and safety at our sites.
 
To the extent the COVID-19 outbreak adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.
 
Market and economic conditions may adversely affect the economic conditions of our customers, demand for our products and services and our results of operations.
 As a global provider of comfort, residential thermal, and security products, services and technologies for the home, as well as a worldwide wholesale distributor of low-voltage electronics products, as well as smart home, fire, power, audio and ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity, and structured wiring products, our business is affected by the performance of the global new and repair and remodel construction industry. Our markets are sensitive to changes in the regions in which we operate and are also influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation, availability of financing, consumer spending habits and confidence, housing market changes, employment rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control, and which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our reputation with customers and negatively impact our results.
 Product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in our Company, our products and our brand image. If our offerings do not meet applicable legal and safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality, or if our products are improperly designed, manufactured, packaged, or labeled, or are otherwise alleged to cause harm or injury, we may need to recall those items, experience increased warranty costs or lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks including litigation and government enforcement action, as well as product liability claims. Such actions may damage our relationship with our customers which may result in a loss of market share; additionally, the financial expenses related to such events may not be covered by our insurance or may be subject to deductibles. We may not be able to obtain indemnity or reimbursement from our suppliers or other third parties for the warranty costs or liabilities associated with our products and there can be no assurance that we will have adequate reserves to cover any recalls, repair and replacement costs. A significant product recall, warranty claim, or product liability case, especially with respect to our security and life safety-related products or services, could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products and services. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, product recalls and litigation related to our products or services, none of which have been material to date.
 We may from time to time pursue acquisitions. Our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired companies or assets
 We have in the past and may from time to time in the future continue to pursue and consummate acquisitions of companies or assets. Our ability to consummate any future acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms or may be unable to receive necessary regulatory approvals or support.
  We regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. The consummation of any particular acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to raise the capital necessary to fund such acquisition which may not be available to us at all or on economically advantageous terms. In addition, if we consummate an acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. Future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further could result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs.
  Acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect. We may not be successful in effectively identifying all risks of an acquired business, integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations or realizing the benefits expected at acquisition. Our due diligence may fail to identify all of the liabilities or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues. We may not be able to achieve the operational synergies or savings nor any growth targets identified in acquisition diligence. The successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business, which could decrease the time that they have to service, attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities.
 We may not be able to retain or expand relationships with certain significant customers.
A number of our customers contribute significantly to our net revenue and operating income. Consolidation or change of control, particularly among our OEM customers (and in certain instances, their authorized dealers), or a decision by any one or more of our customers to outsource all or most manufacturing work to a single equipment manufacturer, or partner with third parties may continue to concentrate our business in a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks relating to dependence on a smaller number of customers. We generally have to qualify, and are required to maintain our status, as a supplier for each of our OEM customers. A significant failure or inability to comply with customer specifications and manufacturing requirements or delays or other problems with
RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
existing or new products or inability to meet price requirements could result in financial penalties, cancelled orders, increased costs, loss of sales, market share shift, loss of customers or potential breaches of customer contracts, which have had and could in the future have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. By virtue of certain customers’ size and the significant portion of revenue that we derive from them, they are able to exert significant influence in the negotiation of our commercial agreements and the conduct of our business with them. If we are unable to retain and expand our business with these customers on favorable terms, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.
 Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute transformation programs or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.
 Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through our ongoing transformation and other programs, such as consolidation and outsourcing of manufacturing operations or facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions, workforce optimizations, product line rationalizations and divestitures, and other cost-saving initiatives. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, asset impairments, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements, and adverse effects on employee morale leading to reduced production and unanticipated departures. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect and the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, attrition, labor relations difficulties, or work stoppages could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 
We are subject to the economic, political, health, epidemic, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.
 Our international revenues represented approximately 28% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our international geographic footprint subjects us to many risks including: exchange control regulations; wage and price controls; antitrust/competition and environmental regulations; employment regulations; foreign investment laws; monetary and fiscal policies and protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures, establish local content requirements, or impact trade volumes; import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes); violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks); changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises; nationalization of private enterprises; natural and man-made disasters, hazards and losses; backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions; violence, civil and labor unrest; acts of terrorism; health epidemics; and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Additionally, certain of the markets in which we operate have adopted increasingly strict data privacy and data protection requirements or may require local storage and processing of data or similar requirements.
 Instabilities and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment can negatively impact our business. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or other countries where we sell or manufacture large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products could negatively impact our business results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies, such as tariffs or quotas, could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
 Tariffs, sanctions and other barriers to trade could adversely affect the business of our customers and suppliers, which could in turn negatively impact our net revenue and results of operations. Instabilities and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, along with the cost of compliance with increasingly complex regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.
 As a result of our global presence, a portion of our net revenue are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, whereas a significant amount of our payment obligations, including pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, and our debt obligations are denominated in U.S. Dollars, which exposes us to foreign exchange risk. We monitor and may seek to reduce such risk through hedging activities; however, foreign
RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose us to financial loss.
 We operate in many diverse regions that require modifications to our products based on local building codes, regulations, standards, certifications and other factors, which may impact our cost to serve and profitability as we continue our penetration into these regions.
 
We rely on a dependable IT infrastructure and network operations that have adequate cyber-security functionality to produce and sell our products and solutions and manage our business.
 The efficient operation of our business requires substantial investment in technology infrastructure systems, including enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems, information systems, supply chain management systems, digital commerce systems and connected solutions platforms and network operations and systems. The failure to acquire, implement, maintain and upgrade as required, these systems may impact our ability to respond effectively to changing customer expectations, manage our business, scale our solutions effectively or impact our customer service levels, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Repeated or prolonged interruptions of service, due to problems with our systems or third- party technologies, whether or not in our control, could have a significant negative impact on our reputation and our ability to sell products and services. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if our information systems fail or do not allow us to transmit accurate information. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues, including the failure to fund upgrades and improvements to our systems, could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our ability to keep our business operating is highly dependent on the proper and efficient operation of our data centers, networks, and data backup systems. In addition, a significant portion of our employees are and have been engaged in remote work from their homes during COVID-19; this further exposes our information technology systems to potential cyber interference and disruption of work activities based on availability and performance of Internet access in the regions in which our employees reside.

RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
Our information technology (“IT”) and engineering systems contain sensitive information, including personal data, trade secrets, and other proprietary information. In addition, our connected products potentially expose our business and customers to cybersecurity threats. As a result, we are subject to systems interruption and service and product failures, not only resulting from the failures of our products or services but also from the failures of third-party service providers, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, and cyber or other security threats. There is no assurance that the comprehensive security measures we have put in place to protect our IT and engineering systems, services, and products against unauthorized access and disclosure of personal data or confidential or trade secret information will be effective in every case.
 
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which, to our knowledge, have been material to date. The potential consequences of a material cyber or other security incident such as a ransomware attack include financial loss, reputational and brand impact, negative media coverage, loss of customers, litigation with third parties, including class-action litigation, regulatory investigations or actions, theft of intellectual property, fines, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, regulatory reporting for data breaches, and increased cyber and other security protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, damages, fines and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered by, or may exceed the amount of any insurance available or may not be insurable.
 Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute transformation programs or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.
 Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through our ongoing transformation and other programs, such as consolidation and outsourcing of manufacturing operations or facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions, workforce optimizations, product line rationalizations and divestitures, and other cost-saving initiatives. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, asset impairments, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements, and adverse effects on employee morale leading to reduced production and unanticipated departures. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect and the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, attrition, labor relations difficulties, or work stoppages could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 We are subject to risks associated with the Reimbursement Agreement, pursuant to which we are required to make substantial cash payments to Honeywell, measured in substantial part by reference to estimates by Honeywell of certain of its liabilities.
 
In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Reimbursement Agreement, described in Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In each calendar quarter, our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock, or take other material corporate actions, in such calendar quarter will be restricted until any amounts payable under the Reimbursement Agreement in such quarter are paid to Honeywell and we will be required to use available restricted payment capacity under our debt agreements to make payments in respect of any such amounts. Payment of deferred amounts and certain other amounts could cause the amount we are required to pay under the Reimbursement Agreement in respect of liabilities arising in any given calendar year to exceed $140 million. All amounts payable under the Reimbursement Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries that act as guarantors under our principal credit agreement, subject to certain exceptions. Under the Reimbursement Agreement, we are subject to certain of the affirmative and negative covenants that are substantially similar to those presently included in our principal credit agreement. Further, pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement, our ability to (i) amend or enter into waivers under our principal credit agreement or our indenture, (ii) enter into another credit agreement or our indenture or make amendments or waivers thereto, or (iii) enter into or amend or waive any provisions under other agreements, in each case, in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of Honeywell under the Reimbursement Agreement, may be subject to Honeywell’s prior written consent. The covenants contained in the Reimbursement Agreement and/or the consent right described in the preceding sentence may significantly limit our ability to engage in many types of significant transactions on favorable terms (or at all),
RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
including, but not limited to, equity and debt financings, liability management transactions, refinancing transactions, mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and other strategic transactions. The Reimbursement Agreement may have material adverse effects on our liquidity and cash flows and on our results of operations, regardless of whether we experience a decline in net revenue. The Reimbursement Agreement may also require us to accrue significant long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, the amounts of which will be dependent on factors outside our control, including Honeywell’s responsibility to manage and determine the outcomes of claims underlying the liabilities. This may have a significant negative impact on the calculation of key financial ratios and other metrics that are important to investors, rating agencies and securities analysts in evaluating our creditworthiness, and the value of our securities. Although we will have access to information regarding these liabilities as we may reasonably request for certain purposes, as well as the ability to participate in periodic standing meetings with Honeywell’s remediation management team responsible for management of the underlying claims, the payment obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement relate to legal proceedings, costs and remediation efforts that we will not control, and we accordingly do not expect to be able to make definitive decisions regarding settlements or other outcomes that could influence our potential related exposure.
 Regulations and societal actions to respond to global climate change could negatively affect our business.
 Responses to climate change may cause a shift away from fossil fuels to alternative power sources such as electricity or alternative fuels such as natural gas/hydrogen mixtures. Many of our thermal solutions are designed for application with oil and gas systems. A shift away from fossil fuels could affect our OEM customers’ business and result in a loss of business for them and for us. If we fail to adapt our solutions to alternative power sources, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Similarly, regulations to drive higher fuel efficiency and requirements to support varying fuel mix could shift business away from us if we fail to adapt our solutions to address these needs in a timely manner.
 
Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters
 Failure to comply with the broad range of standards, laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may result in exposure to substantial disruptions, costs and liabilities.
 The laws and regulations impacting us impose complex, stringent and costly compliance activities, including but not limited to environmental, health, and safety protection standards and permitting, labeling and other requirements regarding, among other things, electronic and wireless communications, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials, remediation of environmental contamination, data security, data protection and data privacy, consumer protection and working conditions, and benefits for and compensation of our employees. We may also be affected by future standards, laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to energy, climate change, product functionality, geopolitical, corporate social responsibility, privacy or similar concerns. We expect that the growth of our business may depend on our development of new technologies in response to legislation and regulations related to efficiency standards, safety, privacy and security, and environmental concerns. These standards, laws, or regulations may further impact our costs of operation, the sourcing of raw materials, and the manufacture and distribution of our products and place restrictions and other requirements or impediments on the products and solutions we can sell in certain geographical locations. The net revenue and margins of our business are directly impacted by government regulations, including safety, performance and product certification regulations, particularly those driven by customer demands and national approvals, as well as changes in trade agreements, tariffs, and environmental and energy efficiency standards. We may develop unexpected legal contingencies or matters that exceed, or are excluded from, insurance coverage. We are subject to and in the future may be subject to various claims, including legal claims arising in the normal course of business. Such claims may include without limitation employment and benefits claims, product recall, personal injury, network security, breaches of or other non-compliance with data security, data protection or data privacy regulations, or property damage claims resulting from the use of our products, services, or solutions, as well as exposure to hazardous materials, contract disputes, or intellectual property disputes. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the level of insurance coverage we hold and/or the amounts accrued for such claims or may be excluded from coverage. In the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolutions of such matters could be unfavorable.
RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
Various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, transfer, disposal, disclosure and security of personal data and other types of regulated data. The interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws and regulations around the world may be inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products and services. Any such new laws or regulations, any changes to existing laws and regulations and any such interpretation may affect demand for our products and services, impact our ability to effectively transfer data across borders in support of our business operations, or increase the cost of providing our products and services. Additionally, any actual or perceived breach of such laws or regulations may subject us to claims and may lead to administrative, civil or criminal liability, as well as reputational harm. We could also be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices, or modify our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Claims or lawsuits related to data security, data protection or data privacy initiated by governmental bodies, customers or other third parties, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly regulatory proceedings, litigation, penalties and fines, or require us to change our business practices, sometimes in expensive ways, or other potential liabilities. Unfavorable publicity regarding our privacy practices could injure our reputation, harm our ability to keep existing customers or attract new customers or otherwise adversely affect our business, assets, revenue, brands, and reputation.
Changes in laws, regulations or government enforcement of policies concerning the environment, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual contaminated sites owned or operated by Resideo, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques, could require us to incur additional currently unanticipated costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
We are currently subject to laws and regulations regarding labor, employment and benefits matters, including consultation requirements, and may be subject in the future to government investigations and/or claims, allegations and/or work stoppages in these areas that may have a negative effect on our business operations and/or financial results.
 We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings, and other contingencies and uncertainties.
 In the ordinary course of business, we may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, and issue guarantees of third-party obligations. We are also subject to various lawsuits, investigations and disputes arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to public disclosure and reporting, commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, labor and employment matters, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters.
We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant costs in connection with some or all of these matters, including in connection with the class action and related derivative lawsuits described in Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we are currently subject to investigations and inquiries by governmental agencies (including the SEC) relating to these matters, which may result in fines or penalties which may not be covered by insurance. We may face future governmental inquiries and investigations on these and other issues.
 On July 30, 2021, the Company executed a term sheet with plaintiffs’ representatives setting forth an agreement in principle to settle the claims alleged in the class action. The total amount to be paid in settlement of the claims as set forth in the agreement in principle is $55 million. Insurance recoveries of approximately $39 million are expected to be made related to the settlement. The settlement is subject to, among other things, court review and approval and other customary conditions. The claim settlement payment and related insurance recoveries have been paid to an escrow account pending final court approval of the Securities Litigation. A motion to approve the settlement was taken under advisement by the court on January 27, 2022 and remains under review by the court.

RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we were required to make payments in addition to the settlement payments noted above, such payments could be significant and could exceed the amounts we have accrued with respect thereto, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. While we maintain or may otherwise have access to insurance for certain risks, certain risks may be excluded and the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims, legal fees, costs and liabilities and we may have to satisfy high insurance retentions. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage (or where there is available insurance but high retention levels) could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 As described in Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the investigation and cleanup of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may arise from hazardous substance releases and exposures. These liabilities arise out of our current and past operations and the operations and properties of predecessor companies (including off-site waste disposal). We are also subject to potentially material liabilities related to compliance of Resideo owned sites with the requirements of various federal, state, local, and foreign governments that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage, treatment, and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances. If we are found to be in violation of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to substantial fines, criminal sanctions, trade restrictions, product recalls, public exposure and be required to install costly equipment or make operational changes to achieve compliance with such laws and regulations.
 Risks related to the Spin-Off and our relationships with Honeywell
 The Spin-Off was generally intended to be a tax-free transaction for our shareholders, but any failure to comply with the relevant tax requirements could result in certain of our shareholders incurring substantial tax liabilities. In addition, we may have material payment obligations to Honeywell under the Tax Matters Agreement, including upon the resolution of pending or future disputes with Honeywell regarding the appropriate allocation of tax liabilities incurred in connection with the Spin-Off.

Completion of the Spin-Off was conditioned on Honeywell’s receipt of separate written opinions from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton and KPMG to the effect that the Spin-Off should qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The opinions assume that the Spin-Off was completed according to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

If the distribution made in connection with the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, then a U.S. Holder who received our common stock in the Spin-Off generally would be treated as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock received. In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Tax Matters Agreement with Honeywell described in Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We presently have, and in the future may have, disputes with Honeywell regarding the allocation of tax related liabilities between us and Honeywell under the Tax Matters Agreement. While we maintain reserves for potential liabilities arising under the Tax Matters Agreement, to the extent we are obligated to indemnify Honeywell for tax related liabilities in respect of matters that are not reserved or in excess of reserved amounts, including upon resolution of any dispute with Honeywell, such payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows.
 
RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
We have certain business conflicts of interest with Honeywell with respect to our past and ongoing relationships. In addition, the agreements that we entered into with Honeywell in connection with the Spin-Off impose significant restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests, and we may from time to time have disputes with Honeywell under such agreements that could have a material impact on our business and operations.
 Conflicts of interest may or have arisen with Honeywell in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:
 •labor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from Honeywell;
 •intellectual property matters;
 •employee recruiting and retention;
 •interpretations of contractual arrangements; and
 •business combinations involving our Company.
 We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with a party other than our former parent company.
The agreements that we entered into with Honeywell in connection with the Spin-Off may impose significant restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. As described in more detail in Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Reimbursement Agreement imposes material restrictions on our business and operations, including limitations or impediments on our ability to separate or otherwise divest businesses and modify or waive the terms of certain agreements in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of Honeywell under the Reimbursement Agreement. In addition, the Trademark Agreement is terminable by Honeywell under certain circumstances, including if we fail to comply with all material obligations, including the payment obligations, set forth in the Reimbursement Agreement. The Trademark Agreement also automatically terminates upon the occurrence of a change of control of Resideo that is not approved by Honeywell, and automatically terminates as to any subsidiary of Resideo upon it ceasing to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Resideo. Any termination of the Trademark Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and reputation. In addition, the provisions of the Trademark Agreement in respect of a change of control of Resideo or the sale of any interests in any subsidiary of Resideo may impact our ability to enter into transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders.
 We and Honeywell also have had and may in the future have disputes under the agreements and related exhibits entered into in connection with the Spin-Off. In addition, because of their former positions with Honeywell, certain of our executive officers and directors, including the chairman of the Board, own equity interests in Honeywell. Continuing ownership of Honeywell shares and equity awards could appear to create potential conflicts of interest if our Company and Honeywell face decisions that could have implications for both our Company and Honeywell.
 
The terms of our debt documents may impose restrictions on our business and our operations require substantial capital and we may not be able to obtain additional capital that we need in the future on favorable terms or at all.

The terms of our varied indebtedness include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests, including actions such as incurring additional indebtedness, paying dividends, making investments or acquisitions, selling or transferring certain assets and other corporate actions. If market changes, economic downturns, or other negative events occur, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired and waivers from our lenders may not be provided. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the terms of our indebtedness giving lenders the right to accelerate the repayment of such debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, we might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments, and lenders could then proceed against any collateral. Any subsequent replacement of the agreements governing such indebtedness, or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and pursue our strategy, unable to raise additional debt financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.
 
RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
Notwithstanding that we completed a follow-on equity offering and a refinance of our debt obligations, we may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth and development, upgrade and improve our manufacturing capabilities, implement further marketing and sales activities, fund ongoing research and development activities, satisfy regulatory and environmental compliance obligations and national approvals requirements, satisfy obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement, fund acquisitions and meet general working capital needs. If our access to capital were to become constrained significantly, or if costs of capital increased significantly, due to lowered credit ratings, increased interest rates, prevailing business conditions, financial leverage, the volatility of the capital markets, decreased investor interest or other factors, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected and our ability to fund future development and acquisition activities could be impacted.

We believe that we have adequate capital resources to meet our projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, including payments to Honeywell under the Reimbursement Agreement. However, we may need additional capital resources in the future and if we are unable to obtain sufficient resources for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market
 Our stock price has been volatile; stockholder’s percentage ownership in our Company may be diluted in the future.
 Our stock price may be volatile. The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates; announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; the loss of, or decrease in sales to, one or more key customers; and departures of key personnel.
A stockholder’s percentage ownership in our Company may be diluted in the future because of common stock-based equity awards that we have granted and expect to grant in the future in accordance with our 2018 Stock Incentive Plan for the benefit of certain employees and other service providers, as well as our equity plan for our non-employee directors. In addition, we may issue additional equity as necessary to finance our ongoing operations and future acquisitions.
 In addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (our “Certificate”) authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock, which may have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our Board may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock. In addition, we may pursue acquisition opportunities for which the consideration thereof may consist partially or entirely of newly issued shares of our common stock and such transactions would dilute the voting power and/or reduce the value of our common stock.
 Certain provisions in our governing documents may discourage takeovers.
 Several provisions of our Charter Documents and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition. These include, among others, our staggered board that remains in effect until our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders; our stockholders are not permitted to act by written consent; we have established advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations and proposals; we limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders and we have limitations on our ability to enter into business combinations transactions.
 These and other provisions of our Charter Documents and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of our Company, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price.
 General Risk Factors

RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
We depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 Due to the complex nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our employees and management who have significant industry expertise, including our engineering and design personnel and trained sales force. Our performance is also dependent on the development of additional personnel and the hiring of new qualified engineering, design, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Competition for qualified personnel in our markets is intense, many locations in which we operate have seen increases in employee resignations, competition for talent, and increases in wages, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. The loss of key employees, our inability to attract new qualified employees or adequately train employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our effective tax rate will be affected by factors including changes in tax rules, and in the interpretation and application of those rules, in the countries in which we operate.
 Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures, and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of our future earnings which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to address base erosion and profit shifting will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes.
If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors’ views of us could be harmed.
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of shares of common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.
 Even if we were to conclude, and our auditors were to concur, that our internal controls over financial reporting provided reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for our shares of common stock, and could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.

If our goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
 
We test, at least annually, the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, as discussed in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. We review other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized or if there was an adverse change in facts and circumstances, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. If the fair value of the Company’s reporting units falls below its carrying amount because of reduced operating performance, market declines, changes in the discount rate, or other conditions, charges for impairment may be necessary. Any such charges may have a material negative impact on our results of operations. There were no impairment charges taken during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
 We may be required to make significant cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans.
 We sponsor defined benefit pension plans under which certain eligible Company employees will earn pension benefits. We have plans in several countries including the U.S., the terms of which require that such qualified defined benefit pension plans maintain certain capitalization levels. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. Our pension plan contributions may be material and could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flow, and results of operations. We may need to make pension plan contributions in future periods sufficient to satisfy funding requirements.
