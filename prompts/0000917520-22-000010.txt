ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW 
The terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Company” and “Integra” refer to Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries, unless the context suggests otherwise.
The Company, headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, is a world leader in medical technology. The Company was founded in 1989 with the acquisition of an engineered collagen technology platform used to repair and regenerate tissue. Since then, Integra has developed numerous product lines from this technology for applications ranging from burn and deep tissue wounds to the repair of dura mater in the brain, as well as nerves and tendons. The Company has expanded its base regenerative technology business to include surgical instruments, neurosurgical products and advanced wound care through global acquisitions and product development to meet the evolving needs of its customers and enhance patient care.
Integra products are sold in more than 130 countries through a direct sales force as well as distributors and wholesalers. We manufacture and sell medical technologies and products in two reportable business segments: Codman Specialty Surgical ("CSS") and Tissue Technologies ("TT"). The CSS segment, which represents two-thirds of our total revenue, consists of market-leading technologies and instrumentation used for a wide range of specialties, such as neurosurgery, neurocritical care and otolaryngology. We are the world leader in neurosurgery and one of the top three providers in instruments used in precision, specialty, and general surgical procedures. Our TT segment generates about one-third of our overall revenue and focuses on three main areas: complex wound surgery, surgical reconstruction, and peripheral nerve repair.
We have key manufacturing and research facilities located in California, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Utah, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland and Switzerland. We source most of our handheld surgical instruments and dural sealant products through specialized third-party vendors.
Vision
We aspire to continue to be a worldwide leader in neurosurgery and reconstructive surgery with a portfolio of leading businesses that delivers outstanding customer experiences through innovation, execution and teamwork to positively impact the lives of millions of patients and their families.
Strategy
Integra is committed to delivering high quality products that positively impact the lives of millions of patients and their families. We focus on four key pillars of our strategy: 1) enabling an execution-focused culture, 2) optimizing relevant scale, 3) advancing innovation and agility, and 4) leading in customer experience. We believe that by sharpening our focus on these areas through improved planning and communication, optimization of our infrastructure, and strategically aligned acquisitions, we can build scale, increase competitiveness and achieve our long-term goals.
To this end, the executive leadership team has established the following key priorities aligned to the following areas of focus:
Strategic Acquisitions. An important part of the Company's strategy is pursuing strategic transactions and licensing agreements that increase relevant scale in the clinical areas in which Integra competes. During 2021, the Company acquired ACell Inc. ("ACell"), an innovative regenerative medicine company specializing in the manufacturing of porcine urinary bladder extracellular matrices. This acquisition not only expanded the Company’s product offering of regenerative technologies, but it also supported the Company’s long-term growth and profitability strategy as this product line has a financial profile similar to Integra’s other regenerative tissue products. All critical components of ACell have been integrated into the Company’s TT segment. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for additional details. In 2021, we continued to advance the development of pioneering neurosurgical technologies from our 2019 acquisitions, Arkis Biosciences, Inc. and Rebound Therapeutics Corporation. 
Portfolio Optimization and New Product Introductions. We are investing in innovative product development to drive a multi-generational pipeline for our key product franchises. Our product development efforts span across our key global franchises focused on potential for significant returns on investment. In addition to new product development, we are funding studies to gather clinical evidence to support launches, ensure market access and improve reimbursement for existing products. In addition to acquisitions and organic reinvestment, we continually look to optimize our portfolio towards higher growth and higher margin businesses. As such, we may opportunistically divest businesses or discontinue products where we see limited runway for future value creation in line with our aspirations due in part to changes in the market, business fundamentals or the regulatory environment.
In January 2021, we completed the sale of our Extremity Orthopedics business to Smith & Nephew USD Limited ("Smith & Nephew"), a subsidiary of Smith & Nephew plc, for approximately $240 million in cash. This transaction enables us to increase 
our investments in our core neurosurgery and tissue technologies businesses and fund pipeline opportunities to expand our addressable markets to strengthen our existing leadership positions in these segments and drive future growth. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for details.
Commercial Channel Investments. Investing in our sales channels is a core part of our strategy to create specialization and greater focus on reaching new and existing customers and addressing their needs. To support our commercial efforts in Tissue Technologies, we expanded our two-tier specialist model to increase our presence in focused segments by creating a virtual selling organization to help serve the evolving needs of our customers. In addition, we continue to build upon our leadership brands across our product franchises in both CSS and TT to engage customers through enterprise-wide contracts with leading hospitals, integrated delivery networks and global purchasing organizations in the United States. Internationally, we have increased our commercial resources significantly in key emerging markets and are making investments to support our sales organization and maximize our commercial opportunities. These investments in our international sales channel position us well for expansion and long-term growth. 
Customer Experience. We aspire to be ranked as a best-in-class provider and are committed to strengthen our relationships with all customers. We continue to invest in technologies, systems and processes to enhance the customer experience. Additionally, we launched digital tools and programs, resources and virtual product training to drive continued customer familiarity with our growing portfolio of medical technologies globally.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Integra currently manufactures and sells our products and technologies in the following two global reportable business segments: Codman Specialty Surgical and Tissue Technologies. We include financial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information under "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", Note 16, Segment and Geographic Information to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Codman Specialty Surgical
The Codman Specialty Surgical business consists of a broad portfolio of market-leading brands, such as Codman®, DuraGen®, DuraSeal®, CUSA®, Mayfield® and Bactiseal®, which are used for the management of multiple disease states, including brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, hydrocephalus and other neurological conditions. The growth in this business in the recent years has been fueled by geographic expansion and new product registrations in markets, such as China, Japan, and Europe, which we expect to continue in the near to long term. 
We also expanded our product offerings in 2021 with the launch of our new intracranial pressure ("ICP") monitoring system, CereLink™ in the U.S. and Europe. It provides clinicians with advanced continuous ICP monitoring that until now, has not been available when treating patients with traumatic brain injuries
Moreover, we are expanding into minimally invasive surgery ("MIS") and the surgical management of intracerebral hemorrhages ("ICH"), with the 2021 clinical launch of Aurora® Surgiscope®, a proprietary surgical solution with integrated visualization and capabilities designed specifically for use in deep-seated brain lesions. We started gathering clinical evidence using this same technology for early surgical intervention for the treatment of ICH. We believe this technology offers the promise of transforming the standard of care in neurosurgery. 
Rounding out the portfolio is a catalog of surgical headlamps and surgical instrumentation, as well as after-market service. With thousands of surgical instrument products, including specialty surgical instruments, we call on the central sterile processing unit of hospitals and acute care surgical centers. Additionally, through a strong U.S. distribution model, we serve the needs of hundreds of medical offices.
Our global commercial network includes clinical specialists, a large direct global sales force and strategic partnerships and distributors that serve hospitals, integrated health networks, group purchasing organizations, clinicians, surgery centers and health care providers.
Tissue Technologies
Following the sale of the Extremity Orthopedics business in the first quarter of 2021, we rebranded the Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segment as Tissue Technologies. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for details. 
The Tissue Technologies segment consists of four unique regenerative technology areas - highly engineered bovine collagen, bovine dermis, porcine urinary bladder, and human amniotic tissue. This broad regenerative platform, which includes multiple leading brands such as Integra® Dermal Matrices, AmnioExcel®, SurgiMend®, MicroMatrix® and NeuraGen®, primarily addresses the needs of plastic, reconstructive and general surgeons focused on the treatment of acute wounds, such as burns, 
chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, and surgical tissue repair, such as hernia, tendon, peripheral nerve repair and protection. 
We have a specialized sales organization composed of directly employed sales representatives, as well as specialty distributors, organized based upon their call point. Our wound reconstruction sales representatives call on surgeons doing procedures in limb salvage, trauma, wound reconstruction and burns, chronic wounds primarily in the inpatient wound care clinic setting. We also have a dedicated surgical reconstruction sales team focused on plastic and reconstructive surgery and hernia procedures with differentiated products. Finally, we have a distributor network focused on biologics. Outside the U.S., we have a combination of direct and indirect sales channels in international markets to sell certain product lines. 
This business segment also includes private-label sales of a broad set of our regenerative and wound care technologies. Our customers are other medical technology companies that sell to end markets primarily in spine, surgical and wound care.
We anticipate new product introductions and new clinical indications will continue to contribute to the growth of the segment. In the third quarter of 2021, we filed the premarket approval application for a specific indication for SurgiMend in the use of post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, for which we hope to obtain FDA approval in 2023.
COMPETITION
Our competitors for CSS are Medtronic, Inc., Stryker Corporation, Becton Dickinson and Company and Aesculap, a division of B. Braun Medical, Inc. In addition, we compete with many smaller specialized companies and larger companies that do not otherwise focus on the offerings of Codman Specialty Surgical technologies. We rely on the depth and breadth of our sales and marketing organization, our innovative technologies, and our procurement and manufacturing operations to maintain our competitive position.
Our competition in TT includes Smith & Nephew plc, Organogenesis Holdings Inc., MiMedx Group, Inc., LifeCell Corporation, a subsidiary of Allergan PLC, C.R. Bard, a subsidiary of Becton Dickinson and Company, and Axogen, Inc. We compete with many additional companies who partially participate in soft tissue reconstruction of complex wounds, peripheral nerve repair and surgical reconstruction.
In addition, our products also compete against medical practices that treat a condition without using a medical device or any particular product, such as medical practices that utilize autograft tissue instead of our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products and nerve repair products. Depending on the product line, we compete based on our products' features, strength of our sales force or distributors, sophistication of our technology and cost effectiveness of our solution.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY 
Our research and development activities focus on identifying unmet surgical needs and addressing those needs with innovative solutions and products. We apply our core competency in regenerative technology to innovate products for neurosurgical, wound applications, plastic surgery, and reconstructive surgery and we have extensive R&D development programs for our core platforms of electromechanical technologies. Additionally, we conduct products and clinical studies to generate efficacy and health economic evidence.
Regenerative Technologies. Integra was the first Company to receive a United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") claim for regeneration of dermal tissue and is a world leader in regenerative technology. Because regenerative technology products represent a fast-growing, high-margin opportunity for us, we allocate a large portion of our research and development budget to these projects. Our regenerative technology development program applies our expertise in bioengineering to a range of biomaterials including natural collagen and human tissues as well as synthetics such as polymers. These unique product designs are used for neurosurgical and orthopedic surgical applications, as well as dermal regeneration, including the healing of chronic and acute wounds, tendon and nerve repair. Our regenerative technology platform includes our legacy Integra® Dermal Regeneration Template ("IDRT") products and complementary technologies that we have acquired. Our collagen manufacturing capability, combined with our history of innovation, provides us with strong platform technologies for multiple indications. 
In 2020, we announced positive clinical and economic data on Integra® Bilayer Wound Matrix ("IBWM") in complex lower extremity reconstruction based on two retrospective studies recently published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the official journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. As surgeons look for ways to efficiently and effectively repair and close wounds, IBWM helps address the efficiency needed in operating rooms by reducing both the operating time and costs to hospitals and patients. In 2021, we completed one of the largest diabetic foot ulcers ("DFU"), randomized controlled trials of the PriMatrix® Dermal Repair Scaffold for the management of DFU. This multi-center study enrolled more than 225 patients with chronic DFU's over the course of 12-week treatments and 4-week follow-up phases. The results of this study, which was published in the Journal of Wound Care, demonstrated that PriMatrix plus standard of care ("SOC") consisting of sharp debridement, infection elimination, use of dressings and offloading was significantly more likely to achieve complete wound closure compared with SOC alone, with a median number of one application of the product. 
Electromechanical Technologies and Instrumentation. Because our electromechanical products and instruments address significant needs in surgical procedures and limit uncertainty for surgeons, we continue to invest in approvals for new indications and next generation improvements to our market-leading products. We have several active programs focused on life cycle management and innovation, for capital and disposable products in our portfolio. Our product development efforts are focused on core clinical applications in CSF management, neuro-critical care monitoring, minimally invasive instruments and electrosurgery and ultrasonic medical technologies, as well as our ambition to transform the standard of care in neurosurgery with product advancements in MIS and ICH. Our lighting franchise is among the most dynamic in the industry. 
The Company benefitted from our product launches from prior years, including our new electrosurgery generator and irrigator system, an innovative customer-centric toolkit for our CertasTM Plus Programmable Valve along with additional shunt configurations. In Japan, we are experiencing strong growth as a result of the successful launch of DuraGen in mid-2019, which is the first and only collagen xenograft approved for use as a dural substitute in the country. We are focused on the development of core clinical applications in our electromechanical technologies portfolio. Also, we continue to update our CUSA Clarity platform by incorporating new ultrasonic handpiece, surgical tips and integrated electrosurgical capabilities. We continue to work with several instrument partners to bring new surgical instrument platforms to the market. 
In the third quarter of 2021, we launched our CereLink ICP Monitor System in the U.S. and Europe. CereLink provides enhanced accuracy, usability and advanced data presentation that provides clinicians with uncompromised, advanced continuous ICP monitoring that until now, has not been available when treating patients with traumatic brain injuries.
In 2021, we continued to advance the early-stage technology platforms we acquired in 2019. Through the acquisition of Arkis Biosciences, we added a platform technology, CerebroFlo® external ventricular drainage ("EVD"), catheter with Endexo® technology, a permanent additive designed to reduce the potential for catheter obstruction due to thrombus formation. The CerebroFlo EVD Catheter has demonstrated an average of 99% less thrombus accumulation onto its surface, in vitro, compared to a market leading EVD catheter. In 2019, we also acquired Rebound Therapeutics, a Company that specialized in single-use medical device, known as Aurora Surgiscope, which is the only tubular retractor system designed for cranial surgery with an integrated access channel, camera and lighting. In the third quarter of 2021, we conducted a limited clinical launch of the Aurora Surgiscope for use in minimally invasive neurosurgery as well as initiated a registry called MIRROR to collect data on early surgical intervention using this same technology platform for the treatment of ICH.
RESOURCES
In general, raw materials essential to our businesses are readily available from multiple sources. For reasons of quality assurance, availability, or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. Our practice is to maintain sufficient inventory of components so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time.
Certain of our products, including but not limited to our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products, wound care products, and nerve and tendon repair products, contain material derived from bovine tissue. We take great care to provide products that are safe and free of agents that can cause disease. In particular, the collagen used in the products that we manufacture is derived from the deep flexor tendon of cattle less than 24 months old from New Zealand, a country that has never had a reported case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("BSE") (otherwise known as mad cow disease), from the U.S. or from fetal bovine dermis. The World Health Organization classifies different types of cattle tissue for relative risk of BSE transmission. Deep flexor tendon and fetal bovine skin are in the lowest-risk category for BSE transmission, and therefore considered to have a negligible risk of containing the agent that causes BSE.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
We seek patent and trademark protection for our key technology, products and product improvements, both in the U.S. and in selected foreign countries. When determined appropriate, we have enforced and plan to continue to enforce and defend our patent and trademark rights. In general, however, we do not rely solely on our patent and trademark estate to provide us with any significant competitive advantages as it relates to our existing product lines. We also rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position. In an effort to protect our trade secrets, we have a policy requiring our employees, consultants and advisors to execute proprietary information and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements also provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of their relationship with us must be kept confidential, except in specified circumstances.

MAYFIELD® is a registered trademark of SM USA, Inc., and is used by Integra under license.
SEASONALITY 
Revenues during our fourth quarter tend to be stronger than other quarters because many hospitals increase their purchases of our products during the fourth quarter to coincide with the end of their budget cycles in the U.S. In general, our first quarter usually has lower revenues than the preceding fourth quarter, the second and third quarters have higher revenues than the first quarter, and the fourth quarter revenues are the highest in the year. The main exceptions to this pattern occur because of material acquisitions as well as impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on our business
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's focus remained on supporting patients, providing customers with life-saving products, and protecting the well-being of our employees. The rapid and evolving spread of the virus and subsequent variants have resulted in unprecedented challenges to the global healthcare industry. In response to the pandemic, we acted swiftly by implementing protocols to ensure continuity of our manufacturing and distribution sites around the world and to provide for the safety of our employees. 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread and unpredictable impacts and the Company has continued to manage risks in this uncertain environment. We remain confident that the underlying markets in which the Company competes remain attractive. We also remain focused on managing the business for the long-term. The Company's adaptability and resiliency in the face of this unprecedented crisis is made possible in part by prior investments in technology infrastructure and operations, as well as our talented and committed global workforce.
Capital markets and worldwide economies have also been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is possible that the pandemic could cause a local and/or global economic recession. Any such economic recession could have a material adverse effect on the Company's long-term business as hospitals curtail and reduce capital as well as overall spending. The COVID-19 pandemic and local actions, such as “shelter-in-place” orders and restrictions on travel and access to our customers or temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers and their contract manufacturers, disruption and/or higher costs to the Company’s supply chain, staffing shortages in hospitals and labor constraints in our facilities, could further impact our sales, margins and our ability to ship our products and supply our customers. Any of these events could negatively impact the number of surgical and medical intervention procedures performed and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Information pertaining to risk factors as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic can be found in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE
We are a manufacturer and marketer of medical devices and Human Tissue and Cell Based Products ("HCT/Ps") and therefore are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the Center for Medicare Services of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, other federal governmental agencies and, in some jurisdictions, by state and foreign governmental authorities. These regulations govern the introduction of new medical devices and HCT/Ps, the observance of certain standards with respect to the design, manufacture, testing, labeling, promotion and sales of the products, the maintenance of certain records, the ability to track devices, the reporting of potential product defects, the import and export of products, and other matters. 
United States Food and Drug Administration
The regulatory process for obtaining product approvals and clearances can be onerous and costly. The FDA requires, as a condition to marketing a medical device in the U.S., that we secure a Premarket Notification clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "FD&C Act"), or an approved premarket approval ("PMA"), application (or supplemental PMA application). Obtaining these approvals and clearances can take up to several years and may involve preclinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA also may require a post-approval clinical study as a condition of approval. To perform clinical trials for significant risk devices in the U.S. on an unapproved product, we are required to obtain an Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA. The FDA also may require a filing for approval prior to marketing products that are modifications of existing products or new indications for existing products. Moreover, after clearance/approval is given, if the product is shown to be hazardous or defective, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have the power to withdraw the clearance or approval, as the case may be, or require us to change the device, its manufacturing process or its labeling, to supply additional proof of its safety and effectiveness or to recall, repair, replace or refund the cost of the medical device. Because we currently export medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that have not been approved by the FDA for distribution in the U.S., we are required to obtain approval/registration in the country to which we are exporting and maintain certain records relating to exports and make these available to the FDA for inspection, if required. 
Human Cells, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products 
Integra, through the acquisition of Derma Sciences and BioD LLC ("BioD"), is involved with the recovery, processing, storage, transportation and distribution of donated amniotic tissue. The FDA has specific regulations governing HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing, or consisting of, human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient. Examples of HCT/Ps include bone, ligament, skin and cornea. 
Some HCT/Ps fall within the definition of a biological product, medical device or drug regulated under the FD&C Act. These biologic, device or drug HCT/Ps must comply both with the requirements exclusively applicable to HCT/Ps and, in addition, with requirements applicable to biologics, devices or drugs, including premarket clearance or approval from the FDA. 
Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act ("Section 361") authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as “361” HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, and Good Tissue Practices when processing, storing, labeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting. 
The American Association of Tissue Banks ("AATB") has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Compliance with these standards is a requirement in order to become an AATB-accredited tissue establishment. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations. We are licensed or have permits for tissue banking in California, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee. In Tennessee, we are registered with the FDA Center for Biological Evaluations and Research.
Procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant Act, which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. BioD, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is a registered Tissue Bank and is involved with the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human amniotic tissue.
On June 22, 2015, the FDA issued an Untitled Letter (the "Untitled Letter") alleging that BioD's morselized amniotic membrane tissue-based products do not meet the criteria for regulation as HCT/Ps solely under Section 361 and that, as a result, BioD would need a biologics license to lawfully market those morselized products. Since the issuance of the Untitled Letter, BioD and the Company have made known to the FDA their disagreement with the FDA’s assertion that certain products are more than minimally manipulated. The FDA has not changed its position that certain of the BioD acquired products are not eligible for marketing solely under Section 361. In July 2020, the FDA issued the final guidance document related to human tissue titled, “Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use” (the “2020 HCT/P Final Guidance”). The 2020 HCT/P Final Guidance document supersedes the November 2017 guidance by the same title.
The HCT/P Final Guidance maintains the FDA’s position that products such as the Company’s morselized amniotic membrane tissue-based products do not meet the criteria for regulation solely as HCT/Ps. In addition, in the November 2017 guidance, the FDA articulated a risk-based approach to enforcement and, while some uses for amniotic membrane tissue-based products would have as much as thirty-six months of enforcement discretion, other high risk uses could be subject to immediate enforcement action. The 2020 HCT/P Final Guidance maintained this approach and extended the discretionary enforcement period to May 31, 2021.
Considering the risk of enforcement action, the Company discontinued the manufacturing of all morselized amniotic membrane tissue-based products prior to May 31, 2021. We no longer distribute these products. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not received any further notice of enforcement action from the FDA regarding its morselized amniotic membrane tissue-based products.
Revenues from the now discontinued BioD morselized amniotic membrane-based products for the year ended December 31, 2021 were less than 1.0% of consolidated revenues. 
Medical Device Regulations
We also are required to register with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. As such, our manufacturing sites are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulations. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, we are required to comply with various FDA requirements and other legal requirements for labeling and promotion. If the FDA believes that a company is not in compliance with applicable regulations, it may issue a warning letter, institute proceedings to detain or seize products, issue a recall order, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against that company, its officers or its employees and may recommend criminal prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. All Integra manufacturing facilities participate in the Medical Device Single Audit Program and are audited annually for compliance with the Quality System for US FDA, Canada, Australia, Brazil, and Japan.
Medical device regulations also are in effect in many of the countries in which we do business outside the U.S. These laws range from comprehensive medical device approval and Quality System requirements for some or all of our medical device products to simpler requests for product data or certifications. Under the European Union Medical Device Directive, medical devices must meet the Medical Device Directive standards and receive CE Mark Certification prior to marketing in the European Union ("EU"). In addition, the EU enacted the EU Medical Device Regulation, which imposes stricter requirements on the marketing and sales of medical devices including but not limited to quality systems, labeling and clinical data. CE Mark Certification requires a comprehensive quality system program, technical documentation, clinical evaluation and data on the product, which are then reviewed by a Notified Body. A Notified Body is an organization designated by the national governments of the EU member states to make independent judgments about whether a product complies with the requirements established by each CE marking directive. The Medical Device Directive, Medical Device Regulation, ISO 9000 series and ISO 13485 are recognized international quality standards that are designed to ensure that we develop and manufacture quality medical devices. Other countries are also instituting regulations regarding medical devices or interpreting and enforcing existing regulations more strictly. Compliance with these regulations requires extensive documentation and clinical reports for our products, revisions to labeling, and other requirements such as facility inspections to comply with the registration requirements. A recognized Notified Body audits our facilities annually to verify our compliance with the ISO 13485 Quality System standard. 
Certain countries, as well as the EU, have issued regulations that govern products that contain materials derived from animal sources. Regulatory authorities are particularly concerned with materials infected with the agent that causes BSE. These regulations affect our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products, hernia repair products, biomaterial products for the spine, nerve and tendon repair products and certain other products, all of which contain material derived from bovine tissue. Although we take great care to provide that our products are safe and free of agents that can cause disease, products that contain materials derived from animals, including our products, may become subject to additional regulation, or even be banned in certain countries, because of concern over the potential for prion transmission. Significant new regulations, a ban of our products, or a movement away from bovine-derived products because of an outbreak of BSE could have a material, adverse effect on our current business or our ability to expand our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Certain of our products contain materials derived from animal sources and may become subject to additional regulation” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Postmarket Requirements. After a device is cleared or approved for commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include the FDA Quality System Regulations which cover the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of medical devices; the FDA's general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or 'off-label' uses; the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which require manufacturers to report recalls and field corrective actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act. Postmarket requirements are also followed globally where our products are registered and approved. These foreign jurisdictions have similar requirements to the FDA which include reporting requirements such as adverse events and recalls.
Other regulations
Anti-Bribery Laws. In the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws that regulate the means by which companies in the health care industry may market their products to hospitals and health care professionals and may compete by discounting the prices of their products. Similar anti-bribery laws exist in many of the countries in which we sell our products outside the U.S., as well as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (which addresses the activities of U.S. companies in foreign markets). Our products also are subject to regulation regarding reimbursement, and U.S. healthcare laws apply when a customer submits a claim for a product that is reimbursed under a federally funded healthcare program. These global laws require that we exercise care in designing our sales and marketing practices, including interactions with healthcare professionals, and customer discount arrangements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are exposed to a variety of risks relating to our international sales and operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
Import-export. Our international operations subject us to laws regarding sanctioned countries, entities and persons, customs, and import-export. Among other things, these laws restrict, and in some cases can prevent, U.S. companies from directly or indirectly selling goods, technology or services to people or entities in certain countries. In addition, these laws require that we exercise care in our business dealings with entities in and from foreign countries. 
Hazardous materials. Our research, development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials. We are subject to country-specific, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products. We believe that our environmental, health and safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by the controlling laws and regulations. However, risk of accidental releases or injury from these materials is possible. These risks are managed to minimize or eliminate associated business impacts. In the event of this type of accident, we could be held liable for damages and face a liability that could exceed our resources. We could be subject to a regulatory shutdown of a facility that could prevent the distribution and sale of products manufactured there for a significant period of time, and we could suffer a casualty loss that could require a shutdown of the facility in order to repair it, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business. Although we continuously strive to maintain full compliance with respect to all applicable global environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could incur substantial costs to fully comply with future laws and regulations, and our operations, business or assets may be negatively affected. Furthermore, global environmental, health and safety compliance is an ongoing process. Integra has compliance procedures in place for compliance with Employee Health & Safety laws, driven by a centrally led organizational structure that ensures proper implementation, which is essential to our overall business objectives. 
In addition to the above regulations, we are, and may be, subject to regulation under country-specific federal and state laws, including, but not limited to, requirements regarding record keeping, and the maintenance of personal information, including personal health information. As a public Company, we are subject to the securities laws and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We also are subject to other present and could be subject to possible future, local, state, federal and foreign regulations. 
Third-Party Reimbursement. Healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third-party payors, including, in the U.S., the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payors, such as indemnity insurers, employer group health insurance programs and managed care plans, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the products. As a result, demand for our products is and will continue to be dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors. The manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type of payor involved and the setting in which the product is furnished and utilized. Reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may be subject to periodic adjustments as a result of legislative, regulatory and policy changes, as well as budgetary pressures. Possible reductions in, or eliminations of, coverage or reimbursement by third-party payors, or denial of, or provision of uneconomical reimbursement for new products may affect our customers' revenue and ability to purchase our products. Any changes in the healthcare regulatory, payment or enforcement landscape relative to our customers' healthcare services have the potential to significantly affect our operations and revenue. 
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Laws and Regulations. As a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity (relating to the confidentiality and security of our information technology systems, products such as medical devices, and other services provided by us) may result in increased costs, lower revenue, new complexities in compliance, new challenges for competition, and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, financial information, intellectual property, and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce.
For example, in the U.S., the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the U.S. federal and state, and industry levels. U.S. federal and 
state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers. In addition, the FDA has issued guidance advising manufacturers to take cybersecurity risks into account in product design for connected medical devices and systems, to assure that appropriate safeguards are in place to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or modification to medical devices that contain software and reduce the risk of introducing threats into hospital systems that are connected to such devices. The FDA also issued guidance on post market management of cyber security in medical devices.
Outside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and, potentially, intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. In Europe, for example, we are subject to EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection, use and transfer of personal data and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the EU to comply with EU privacy and data protection rules.
Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are subject to requirements relating to information technology which could adversely affect our business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of the risks accompanying compliance with data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations.
These laws and regulations impact the ways in which we use and manage personal data, protected health information, and our information technology systems. They also impact our ability to move, store, and access data across geographic boundaries. Compliance with these requirements may require changes in business practices, complicate our operations, and add complexity and additional management and oversight needs. They also may complicate our clinical research activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data.
HUMAN CAPITAL 
Workforce Demographics
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,800 regular full and part time employees and 900 contingent, subcontracted, and outsourced partners. 
65% of our employees are located in the United States, 23% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 4% in Latin America and Canada and 8% in Asia Pacific which includes Australia and New Zealand.
Diversity and Inclusion
A diverse workforce and an inclusive culture and work environment is a business priority and a key to our long-term success. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion ("D&I") starts at the top with our Board of Directors and CEO. At all levels of the company, we focus on attracting, retaining, and developing our diverse talent.
Leadership Commitment and Accountability
Executive leadership team members set the D&I goals for the company and advancing diversity and inclusion initiatives to build stronger teams remains a company-wide goal.
Leadership Councils, Employee Resource Groups and External Partnerships:
We are accountable to our D&I commitment through our leadership councils, employee resource groups, and external partnerships.
•Our Women’s Leadership Council, since its establishment in 2017, is an action and results-oriented advisory group comprised of fifteen of our senior women leaders across Integra. The specific charter of the Council is to work together to identify ways to continue to attract and retain female talent, advance the development of our women into leadership roles, increase the cultural awareness of the value of inclusion and diversity in our company, and create specific development forums for our high performing women at Integra. 
•Employee resources groups encourage a culture of awareness and inclusion, assist in the attraction and retention of diverse talent, and help colleagues develop leadership skills. Members of the executive leadership team serve as sponsors for each of Integra’s employee resource groups. Integra has five Employee Resources Groups: 

◦Women of Integra Networks ("WIN") with 20+ chapters globally
◦African American Affinity Group
◦Veteran Employee Resource Group
◦Indian American Professional Network
◦Asian American and Pacific Islander Employee Resource Group
•We reinforce our commitment to diversity by partnering with other organizations focused on driving inclusion in the workplace including the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance D&I in the workplace and Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association, an association dedicated to further the advancement and impact of women in the business of healthcare.
Promoting an inclusive culture through learning opportunities:
To help drive our culture of inclusion, our colleagues participate in programs focused on how to manage bias and value differences.
•Members of our executive leadership, senior management team, and larger scope leaders participate in a half-day microinequities training. The content includes understanding unconscious bias and microinequities, how to identify microinequities in day-to-day decisions and actions as leaders, and ways to mitigate microinequities on an individual and organizational level.
•Upon joining Integra, colleagues globally participate in two programs to promote inclusion: a course that creates awareness of unconscious biases in the workplaces and tools to build-bias breaking skills and a course that examines what practicing inclusion in the workplace looks like.
Gender Diversity:
We believe that our company is stronger and will deliver strong operating results when we build diverse teams and leverage broad perspectives to meet the needs of our shareholders, customers, colleagues, and communities we serve. 
The breakout of our colleagues by gender as of December 31, 2021:
48% of Integra’s overall population is female, 52% male. We continue to strive to ensure our diversity in our leadership roles is representative of our overall population. Through mentorship, sponsorship, recruitment efforts, and development programs we look to continue to grow our population of females in leadership roles at Integra. Currently, 42% of our executive leaders and 45% of senior leaders (non-executive vice presidents) are female.
In partnership with Leadership Edge, a company founded by women leaders and dedicated to growing and mentoring women, Integra sponsors the Excel Women’s Leadership Program. The program is designed to accelerate the development and advancement of high potential, mid-career female leaders into senior leadership roles. The program has assisted in further building our pipeline of women leaders with 50% of the program’s graduates being promoted into roles with increased responsibility.
Employee Health and Safety:
Integra LifeSciences is committed to providing a safe environment for all employees and visitors. We rely on our environmental, health and safety management systems as well as entrusting our managers to oversee and ensure health and safety at their respective sites and foster a workplace culture to achieve that end. We implement our approach globally by our systems and support at regional and country levels from colleagues that implement proper safety protocols, identify and correct hazards, and remain safety conscious at all times. Managers are expected to enforce health and safety regulations, including compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. Our Environmental Health and Safety ("EH&S") organizational structure incorporates both workplace EH&S coordinators and compliance teams. We have developed an Incident Procedure Policy and General Safety Rules that guide our colleagues to improve our workplace environment, improve safety, and reduce risk and costs.
As we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants, we have placed a high priority on employee health, providing resources to support our workforce through this challenging time. To help limit exposure to the coronavirus, we acted to ensure employees in business-critical functions who cannot work from home are protected, including those in research and development, quality, manufacturing, distribution, and sales. Personal protective equipment, increased sanitation and social distancing guidance are provided to protect our employees. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants and respond based on guidance from U.S. and global health organizations, relevant governmental guidance, and evolving practices.
