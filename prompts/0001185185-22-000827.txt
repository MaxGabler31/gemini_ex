ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



The Company was incorporated in the State of Wyoming on October 17, 2016.  Rest EZ, Inc. markets a sleeping aid soft gel capsule to be sold to the general public through wholesalers and retailers, as well as online at www.RestEz.net. The Rest EZ Sleep Aid Supplement soft gel capsule is a liquid gel capsule containing soybean oil, Melatonin, gelatin, glycerin, L-glutamic Acid, yellow beeswax, purified water, L-leucine, L-arginine and lecithin. It provides faster rate with up to 100% absorption by the body. The gels are manufactured by an unaffiliated outside provider, Sport Energy.



Beyond the general FDA requirement that every dietary supplement be labeled as such, either with the term "dietary supplement" or with a term that substitutes a description of the product's dietary ingredient(s) for the word "dietary" (e.g., "herbal supplement" or "calcium supplement"), and the FDA’s safety monitoring responsibilities for dietary supplement firms once a dietary supplement is on the market, there are no additional FDA requirements specific to this product, and federal law does not require dietary supplements to be proven safe to FDA's satisfaction before they are marketed.



Rest EZ, Inc. has commenced its full operations of having its Rest EZ Sleep Aid Supplement soft gel distributed nationwide through wholesalers and retailers, as well as online at www.RestEz.net. The Company does not manufacture its own soft gel capsule; this is outsourced to Sport Energy, an unaffiliated outside provider, who manufactures liquid gels. We plan during the next twelve months to increase our client base by aggressively marketing our product to generate: (1) wholesalers and expand our wholesale base; (2) sales on our website; and (3) sales through retail chain stores and word of mouth advertising.



Rest EZ Inc. Inc. has developed a plan to market its soft gel capsule to the general public. Rest EZ, Inc. has wholesale distribution, retail, and online sales through our web site www.restez.net.



Overall Strategic Direction



Over the next twelve months, Rest EZ, Inc. plans establish its reputation in the soft gel capsule industry and network in the wholesale and retail markets, thereby attracting new customers. The Company plans to generate and/or obtain new clients through word of mouth, wholesale, retail and Internet. In the soft gel capsule business, as in most similar businesses, word of mouth advertisement is very effective. Once potential clients see our soft gel capsule at various retail or internet and/or community gatherings, the Company is confident that it will be able to attract and/or obtain new clients, based on favorable reception in the retail sector thus far.



The Company aims to form long-term working relationships with wholesalers and retailers throughout the nation.



Manufacturing and Packaging



Rest EZ, Inc. is not and will not be the manufacturer of the soft gel capsule it markets. The gels are manufactured and packaged by an unaffiliated outside provider, Sport Energy, with whom Rest EZ, Inc. has a verbal agreement. The terms of our verbal agreement are as follows: Rest EZ Inc. will provide a Purchase Order to Sport Energy for every manufacturing order, Sport Energy will then send an invoice payable in full prior to delivery of the product.



The capsules will be manufactured and packaged in bulk quantities for sale in anticipation of fulfillment of orders as placed by wholesalers/retailers and on our web site at www.restez.net.



Sales Strategy



The Company has established a strong sales approach: direct sales through Mr. Sosa to wholesalers and retailers, along with our professional and easy to use web site. Our direct sales will be conducted by Mr. Sosa. He will market the product to wholesalers nationally, to retail chain stores and worldwide distributors. The Company’s current marketing strategy consists of various Point of Sale materials to include advertising posters, flyers and magnetic strips with the Company’s name and product. In addition, sales will be done through referrals, distribution by wholesalers and online marketing.



Over the next twelve months, Rest EZ, Inc. plans to expand its reputation further, add wholesalers, retail chain stores, and increase sales to the public.

The Sleeping Aid Supplement Industry



Competition



There are numerous companies and individuals who are engaged in the sleeping aid supplement business, and such business is intensely competitive. We believe the highly specialized nature of our corporate focus, utilizing the sleep aid combined with certain amino acids in a soft gel capsule, enables us to be a better long-term partner for our clients than those organized as a traditional sleeping aid supplement company. Our research shows it is difficult to determine the correct way to manufacture this product in a true liquid gel form, as the ingredients tend to break down when mixed with water or any other liquid. Rest EZ, Inc. has found the right combination to make an easy-to-use sleep aid liquid gel capsule that enhances the benefits of taking the Sleep Aid.



The Company believes that by offering only its quality Sleep Aid soft gel capsule and superior service its customers, we will be able to generate more customers. Nevertheless, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources, as well as greater managerial capabilities, than we do and are therefore, in certain respects, in a better position than we are to provide soft gel capsules. We believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control, including, but not limited to pricing, the timing and market acceptance of soft gel caps, and services. We will face direct competition from several online, direct marketing, privately-held companies.



Current Business Focus



The Company’s business focus is to market the Sleep Aid soft gel capsules at a reasonable price to the largest percentage of the target market population as possible.  The Company believes that the ability to deliver a quality product that few other companies and/or individuals produces is the main factor in generating a customer base and fostering repeat customers.



Advantages of Competitors over us



Many of our existing and potential competitors, which will include online Sleep Aid supplements businesses are focusing more closely on internet-based sales, these companies have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources, greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base than we will. Furthermore, there is the risk that larger financial companies which offer internet and direct sales may decide to use extremely low pricing rates in the Sleep Aid supplement market to acquire and accumulate customer accounts and additional self-space at stores.  We do not plan to offer extremely low pricing; therefore, such pricing techniques, should they become common in our industry, could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business model.



Generally, competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we will.



There can be no assurance that our potential competitors will not develop products and services comparable or superior to those that will be developed and offered by us or adapt more quickly than us to changing customer requirements, or that we will be able to timely and adequately complete the implementation, and appropriately maintain and enhance the operation, of our business model. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins, failure to obtain any significant market share, or loss of market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, or that competitive pressures faced by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete against other Sleep Aid supplement businesses.
