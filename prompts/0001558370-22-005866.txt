Item 1.   Business
Overview
Rite Aid Corporation (“Rite Aid” or the “Company”) is on the front lines of delivering health care services and retail products to over one million Americans daily. Our pharmacists are uniquely positioned to engage with customers and improve their health outcomes. We provide an array of whole being health products and services for the entire family through over 2,400 retail pharmacy locations across 17 states. Through Elixir, our pharmacy benefits manager, we provide pharmacy benefits and services to over two million members nationwide.
Our corporate headquarters are located at 30 Hunter Lane, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania 17011, and our telephone number is (717) 761-2633. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol of “RAD.” We were incorporated in 1968 and are a Delaware corporation.
The terms “Company,” “Rite Aid,” “we,” “our” or “us,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to Rite Aid Corporation and its affiliates. The term “affiliates” means direct and indirect subsidiaries of Rite Aid Corporation and partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are partners.
We continue to focus and implement our strategic initiatives aimed at operating as a fully-integrated, stand-alone healthcare company with a retail footprint. Our key accomplishments in fiscal 2022 included, i) increased Adjusted EBITDA by $68.2 million over the prior year, ii) increased revenues by $525.0 million over the prior year, iii) entered into a comprehensive rebate aggregation agreement that has enabled us to expand gross margin at Elixir and has made us more competitive in the marketplace, iv) completed our integration of Bartell Drugs and moved into the lead position in the Seattle market, and v) took additional steps to improve our capital structure which included paying off the remaining $91 million of our calendar 2023 bonds and amending and extending our revolving credit facility, extending the maturity out to August 2026. As a result of this extension, we have no debt maturing until July 2025.
We report our business in two distinct segments: our Retail Pharmacy Segment, which consists of Rite Aid, Bartell Drug stores and Health Dialog, and our Pharmacy Services Segment, which consists of Elixir, our PBM.
Retail Pharmacy Segment— In our Rite Aid retail stores, our highly-trained pharmacists dispense medications pursuant to prescriptions written by medical providers and educate our customers on alternative remedies that can supplement traditional options. We offer a wide range of healthcare services, including administering immunizations against COVID-19, the flu, shingles and more; assisting our customers with high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes; providing guidance on combating obesity and tobacco addiction; and educating our customers on managing medications and potential side effects. Throughout the pandemic, our pharmacists have been on the front lines of testing and vaccinating, and we made great strides in changing perceptions of pharmacists as providers whose reach extends well beyond filling prescriptions. We believe that offerings such as these have established pharmacists as the most accessible and trusted last-mile connectors in healthcare.
In fiscal 2022, prescription drug sales accounted for 70.0% of our total drugstore sales. We believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a significant part of our business due to a combination of our efforts to expand the role of our over 6,400 pharmacists as whole-being health advocates; demographic trends such as an aging population and increased life expectancy; our focus on growth customers, particularly women between the ages of 25 to 49 who take care of themselves, their children, aging parents, and even pets; anticipated growth in the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program as “baby boomers” continue to enroll; and the discovery of new and better prescription drug and over-the-counter therapies. In addition, we offer a wide assortment of front-end merchandise to complement our pharmacy services and to provide convenience to our customers. We carry a full assortment of front-end products, which accounted for the remaining 30.0% of our total drug store sales in fiscal 2022. Front-end products include over-the-counter medications, health and beauty aids, personal care items, cosmetics, household items, food and beverages, greeting cards, seasonal merchandise, pet care, and numerous other everyday and convenience products.

We seek to differentiate our stores from other chain drugstores, in part, through our emphasis on the benefits of both traditional and alternative remedies, a reconstituted assortment of clean, natural, organic, and eco-friendly merchandise, our flagship store format, further investment in owned brands and our strategic partnership with GNC, a retailer of vitamin and mineral supplements. We offer a wide variety of products through our portfolio of owned brands, which contributed approximately 19% of our front-end sales in fiscal 2022 and which we are positioning for future growth.
We completed the acquisition of the Bartell Drug Company during December 2020. The strategic acquisition of the Bartell Drug Company fits into our RxEvolution strategy, complementing our commitment to total health and wellness, the importance of the pharmacist as a trusted health advisor, and the critical role of the neighborhood pharmacy. This expansion within the greater Seattle area will allow us to better service customers, health plans and healthcare providers.
The average size of each store in our chain is approximately 13,600 square feet, and average store size is larger for our locations in the western United States. As of February 26, 2022, 59% of our stores were freestanding; 55% of our stores included a drive-through pharmacy; and 67% included a GNC store within a Rite Aid store.
Health Dialog is a provider of healthcare coaching and disease management services to health plans and employers. Health Dialog has robust analytics and service offerings that are designed in response to client requests. Health Dialog provides these services using a call-in line staffed by nurse practitioners and through an online platform. We are currently revitalizing Health Dialog to better serve the changing needs of health plan clients, including assisting with reducing hospitalizations, increasing medication adherence and delivering significant savings.
Pharmacy Services Segment—Elixir, our mid-market national pharmacy benefits manager (“PBM”), provides a suite of PBM offerings including technology solutions, mail delivery services, specialty pharmacy, network and rebate administration, claims adjudication and pharmacy discount programs. Elixir also provides prescription discount programs and Medicare Part D insurance offerings for individuals and groups. Elixir provides services to various clients across its different lines of business, including major health plans, commercial employers, labor groups and state and local governments, representing over 2 million covered lives, including approximately 0.7 million covered lives through our Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Elixir continues to focus its efforts and offerings to its target market of small to mid-market employers, labor unions and regional health plans, including provider-led health plans and government sponsored Medicaid and Medicare plans.
Elixir is an integral component of our strategy and we believe that Elixir will become a differentiated market leader by lowering total healthcare costs through consumer engagement. We are modernizing our technology platforms, enhancing our clinical programs, and launching our new specialty offering across our book of business. For our markets that overlap with Rite Aid and Bartell stores, we can provide highly curated clinical offerings that not only lowers costs, but also engage members in our stores with our pharmacists.
Industry Trends
The COVID-19 crisis brought many new challenges to the industry and severely impacted the U.S. economy. We executed preparedness plans to maintain continuity of our operations, including transitioning many office-based associates to a remote work environment. We also provided enhanced benefits to our associates, and expanded resources to assist associates with the stress caused by the pandemic. Going forward, we expect to continue to provide COVID-19 testing, vaccinations, and boosters, as well as incurring the corresponding operating and administrative expenses, as COVID-19 becomes part of everyday life.
Aside from the effects of COVID-19, the rate of pharmacy sales growth in the United States continues to be negatively impacted by a decline in new blockbuster drugs, drug safety concerns, higher copays and an increase in the use of generic (non-brand name) drugs, which are less expensive but do generate higher gross margins. New drug development in the next few years is expected to be concentrated in specialty prescriptions, which are high-cost drugs targeted toward complex or rare chronic conditions. On the other hand, we expect prescription usage to continue to grow in the coming years due to the aging U.S. population, increased life expectancy, “baby boomers” continuing to become eligible for the federally funded Medicare prescription program, and new drug therapies. Additionally, rising U.S.

healthcare costs and the shortage of primary care physicians are creating opportunities for pharmacists and drugstores to play a more active role in driving positive health outcomes for patients. Services such as immunizations, including those for COVID-19, medication therapy management, chronic condition management, clinics, medication adherence and counseling can all be handled by our trained pharmacists. 
In terms of our traditional drug dispensing business, generic prescription drugs continue to help lower overall costs for customers and third-party payors. We believe the utilization of existing generic pharmaceuticals will continue to remain strong, although the pace of introduction of new generic drugs has slowed. The gross profit from a generic drug prescription in the retail drugstore industry is generally greater than the gross profit from a brand drug prescription. However, the sale amount can be substantially less and has impacted our overall revenues and same store sales.
The retail drugstore industry is highly competitive and consolidation has accelerated. We believe that such trends as vertical integration retail pharmacy companies with PBMs and insurance companies (such as CVS Health), aggressive generic pricing programs at competitors such as Wal-Mart and various supermarket chains, and increased utilization of digital commerce, will further increase competitive pressures in the industry. Front-end product pricing has continued to be highly promotional in the retail drugstore business, which contributes to additional competitive pressures.
The retail drugstore industry continues to rely significantly on third-party payors. Over the past several years, third-party payors, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies, have changed the eligibility requirements of participants and have successfully reduced certain reimbursement rates. This trend is expected to continue, which puts added pressure on Rite Aid and our competitors’ results. Medicare Part D providers have also introduced plans that have restricted network options, under which a patient can elect a plan with a lower copay in exchange for the choice to use a limited number of pharmacies to fill their prescriptions. In order to participate in these restricted networks, retail pharmacies generally are required to accept lower reimbursement rates. We expect the use of these restricted network strategies to continue to increase. When third party payors, including the Medicare Part D program and state-sponsored Medicaid agencies, reduce the number of participants and/or reduce their reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the industry could be reduced, and profitability of the industry adversely affected. These possible adverse effects can be partially offset by lowering our product cost, controlling expenses, dispensing higher-margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services and growing our share of dispensing prescriptions.
The PBM industry is generally concentrated among the three largest PBMs, although niche PBMs and organizations seeking to carve out specific PBM-related services continue to emerge.  Plan sponsor clients of PBMs are seeking new and innovative solutions to manage pharmacy benefit costs.  Certain market segments, such as regional health plans, union/municipal plans, and certain mid-market employers are seeking viable alternatives to the “Big 3” PBM providers.  Also, plan sponsors with covered populations in geographically concentrated areas, such as hospital/health system clients and small to mid-sized employers, are seeking to leverage geographic opportunities to negotiate more favorable pharmacy pricing and/or integrate their community based clinical management resources, with integrated PBM and pharmacy providers, such as Elixir and Rite Aid pharmacies.
Strategy
As a healthcare company with a retail footprint operating in diverse communities throughout the country and engaging over one million customers per day through our various lines of business, we are positioned to continue making a meaningful difference in the lives of our customers, associates, and neighbors. During fiscal 2022, we have been instrumental in America’s fight against COVID-19, delivering over 14 million vaccine doses and administering over 3 million PCR tests. Our role in fighting the pandemic allowed us to foster new customer relationships, convincingly demonstrate the central role of the pharmacist in American healthcare, and create a suite of technology tools that we can continue to leverage for future clinical initiatives. As we look past the heart of the pandemic period, our company is well-positioned for a new phase of growth. 
While we remain committed to the pillars of our RxEvolution strategy for re-invigorating our brand and go-to-market approach, we are focused on initiatives spanning a number of growth vectors available to us: 1) Deepening our 

7



share in the markets and segments we currently serve; 2) Expanding our offerings to new markets, segments, and customers; and 3) Creating new offerings leveraging our portfolio of assets to meet the evolving needs of customers and other stakeholders. We are excited about the growth opportunities we see before us and their potential to drive greater earnings, new relationships, and innovative ways of going to market.
1. Deepening our share in the markets and segments we currently serve
In the pharmacy, we are developing new tools and methods to boost medication adherence. We see this as win-win for all stakeholders. According to published research, proper adherence rates for most medications fall in the 50-60% range. This lack of adherence leads to approximately 125,000 avoidable deaths each year and hundreds of billions of preventable medical expenses. While there are multiple causes of non-adherence, there are levers available to us that we believe can influence patients to become more adherent to their prescription drugs. Increases in overall adherence can drive significant increases in gross profit. We are also working to increase ancillary immunizations through tools that identify customers with gaps. 
In the front end of our stores, we are focused on improving the variety and unit economics of our Own Brand products, driving increased loyalty through our newly launched Rite Aid Rewards program, partnering with suppliers to curb inflationary pressures, and scaling our beauty assortment – with a particular eye to the evolving tastes of our customers. Our new beauty assortment showed 10% year-on-year growth in our pilot locations and we plan to roll out these improvements to our broader fleet. We continue to make necessary investments in refreshing our portfolio of stores to enable a welcoming and enjoyable shopping experience. Our comprehensive approach to merchandising is aimed at enabling customers to achieve not only physical health but general wellbeing both inside and out.
We continue to broaden our penetration into online channels. We have grown e-commerce sales through continued improvements to our web and mobile digital experiences and launched a Buy Online Pickup in Store (BOPS) option this year. Revenues from our third-party delivery and marketplace channels grew by 50% in fiscal 2022 and we expect similar growth rates in fiscal 2023. 
Finally, we believe Elixir has become well-positioned to be a growth driver in the coming years. We have improved our pricing positioning through strong network contracts and our new rebate aggregator. The new pricing positioning is enabling us to deliver a unique and compelling value proposition. Our Elixir Savings cash discount business continues to grow in both EBITDA and revenue. We have identified meaningful EBITDA opportunity by improving our contracts, gaining access to more limited distribution drugs and growing volume from PBM clients and other parties. 
2. Expanding our offerings 
In the coming year we are focused on a) expanding our footprint of stores into underserved markets; b) expanding our merchandise selection within our stores through store-within-a-store partnerships, and c) bringing our suite of services to a broader swath of clients. 

a) | Expanding our store footprint – Approximately 1 in 7 Americans live more than 5 miles away from their nearest pharmacy, providing considerable opportunity for growth of our footprint into new markets and states that Rite Aid does not serve today. We plan to launch small-format stores centered around pharmacy fulfillment and clinical services, with a particular focus on markets where access to pharmacy is limited.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b) | Store-within-a-store partnerships – We are developing store-within-a-store partnerships with well-known consumer-oriented retailers and brands. These creative partnerships will leverage our space to provide an exciting new range of products and services to our customers in a working-capital efficient manner.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c) | Bringing services to new clients – We are revitalizing our Health Dialog population health solution to better serve the changing needs of a growing variety of health plan clients. Health Dialog has robust analytics and service offerings that are designed in response to client requests. We are also developing relationships with new types of customers, including pharma manufacturers

3. Creating new offerings leveraging our portfolio of assets 
Although we are most well-known for our over 2,400 retail community pharmacies, we also have a broad portfolio of complementary assets including: specialty and mail order pharmacies with national scale; a full-service PBM with scale, flexibility, and expertise; a claims adjudication platform; a prescription discount card services platform; medication adherence and clinical services from Health Dialog; a strong network of relationships across the retail and health care value chains; and, most importantly, a strong and loyal base of 35M+ customers. We are bringing these assets together in synergistic ways to create offerings that address the unmet needs of customers, payers, and other stakeholders across healthcare and retail.
We are growing our health plan business, focused on improving clinical and economic outcomes for plan members by leveraging our pharmacy expertise and customer touchpoints. We currently have contracts with five health plans, with another dozen in the pipeline.
We expect to grow our service offerings to other PBMs, anchored by licensing access to our leading claims adjudication platform.
We are establishing strategic partnerships with healthcare and retail innovators to help them scale by providing much-needed products and services to our customer base.
Finally, we are continually establishing additional touchpoints with customers – existing and new – via digital channels to create a seamless digital customer experience.
Products and Services
Sales of prescription drugs for our Retail Pharmacy segment represented approximately 70.0%, 66.7% and 67.0% of our total drugstore sales in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, prescription drug sales were $12.2 billion, $10.9 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively. See the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Continuing Operations” and our consolidated financial statements.
We carry a full assortment of non-prescription, or front-end, products. The types and number of front-end products in each store vary, and selections are based on customer needs and preferences and available space. No single front-end product category contributed significantly to our sales during fiscal 2022. Our Retail Pharmacy segment’s principal classes of products in fiscal 2022 were the following:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-----------------------------------------------+---+---------------+--
​ | | Percentage of | 
Product Class | | Sales | ​
Prescription drugs | | 70.0 | %
Over-the-counter medications and personal care | | 11.0 | %
Health and beauty aids | | 4.5 | %
General merchandise and other | | 14.5 | %

​
We offer a wide variety of own brand products to meet the needs of our customers in virtually every non-pharmacy department. We continue to focus on increasing own brand sales and penetration by expanding our assortment, redefining our brand architecture and brands, refreshing our package design, and driving greater support through our marketing. We believe that today’s consumer expects high quality, differentiated own brand products that deliver performance equal to national brands at a better value. A refresh of our own brand offering is critical to improving our gross margin and reducing our working capital investment in inventory.
Through Elixir, we provide a fully integrated suite of PBM offerings including technology solutions, mail delivery services, specialty pharmacy, network and rebate administration, claims adjudication and pharmacy discount programs. In addition to its PBM offerings, Elixir also offers fully integrated mail-order and specialty pharmacy services

through Elixir Pharmacy. Through Elixir Insurance (“EI”), Elixir also serves seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D. In addition, Elixir, through its Laker Software, performs prescription adjudication services for its own claims.
Technology
All of our stores are integrated into a common pharmacy system, which enables our customers to fill or refill prescriptions in any of our stores throughout the country, identifies adverse drug interactions, and enables our pharmacists to fill prescriptions more accurately and efficiently. Our customers may also order prescription refills online, at www.riteaid.com, using our mobile app, or over the phone through our telephonic automated refill systems for pick up at a Rite Aid store or home delivery from a majority of our stores. We have automated pharmacy dispensing units in high volume stores, which are linked to our pharmacists’ computers that fill and label prescription drug orders. We utilize central fill technology to facilitate the automated picking, packaging, and labeling of prescriptions in a central filling location, which are sent to certain retail stores for delivery to the customer. We also utilize workload sharing technology within our stores, whereby stores within a close proximity can shift the fulfillment of prescriptions to stores with excess capacity. The efficiency of these processes allows our pharmacists to spend more time consulting with and answering our customers’ questions and concerns about their prescription medications and health conditions. Additionally, each of our stores employs point-of-sale technology that supports sales analysis and recognition of customer trends. This same point-of-sale technology facilitates the maintenance of perpetual inventory records which, together with our sales analysis, drives our automated inventory replenishment process.
We launched our new website, mobile application, and e-commerce solution in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.  This personalized user experience is built on a modern and scalable platform that will serve as the foundation for our digital and omni-channel solutions. Through RxEvolution, we will continue to enhance and modernize the technology platforms that support our company, with a meaningful focus on customer experience and design.
We continue to enhance our Elixir mobile app with a focus on providing members with the best and most effective low cost medications, in a manner that is completely personalized. It will not simply facilitate transactions, but rather advance a members ability to improve whole health.
Elixir continues to modernize the technology platforms that service its core PBM business as well as other PBMs. Initial focus is on the customer care experience, clinical operations, client implementations and data exchange. We see an opportunity to further enhance our technology leadership in this market and improving operational efficiencies both internally as well as externally for our clients. We are leveraging a cloud platform shaped with our decades of experience in scalable claims adjudication, customer care and clinical programs while transforming our products and services to offer a PBM-as-a-Service (PBMaaS) model. This ecosystem will serve our target markets to include small to mid-sized PBMs and mid to large health plans. 
​
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Since fiscal 2015, under our pharmaceutical purchasing and delivery agreement (“Purchasing and Delivery Agreement”) with limited exceptions, we purchased all of our branded pharmaceutical products and almost all of our generic (non-brand name) pharmaceutical products from McKesson. If our relationship with McKesson were disrupted, we could temporarily experience difficulties filling prescriptions for branded and generic drugs until we execute a replacement wholesaler agreement or develop and implement self-distribution processes.
We purchase our non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers. We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the non-pharmaceutical merchandise we carry and that the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on our business.
We sell private brand and co-branded products that generally are supplied by numerous sources. The GNC branded vitamin and mineral supplement products that we sell in our stores are developed by GNC, and along with our Rite Aid brand vitamin and mineral supplements, are manufactured by GNC.

10



Customers and Third Party Payors
During fiscal 2022, our stores filled approximately 238.1 million prescriptions and served over one million customers per day. The loss of any one customer would not have a material impact on our results of operations.
In fiscal 2022, substantially all of our pharmacy sales were to customers covered by third party payors (such as insurance companies, prescription benefit management companies, government agencies, private employers or other managed care providers) that agree to pay for all or a portion of a customer’s eligible prescription purchases based on negotiated and contracted reimbursement rates. During fiscal 2022, the top five third party payors accounted for approximately 77.4% of our pharmacy sales. The largest third party payor, Caremark, represented 32.1% of our pharmacy sales. The loss of, or a significant change to the prescription drug reimbursement rates by, a major third party payor could decrease our revenue and harm our business.
During fiscal 2022, Medicaid and related managed Medicaid payors sales were approximately 18.2% of our pharmacy sales, of which the largest single Medicaid payor was approximately 2.1% of our pharmacy sales. During fiscal 2022, approximately 38.2% of our pharmacy sales were to customers covered by Medicare Part D.
Through our Pharmacy Services segment we provide innovative pharmaceutical solutions for our clients which are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, managed Medicaid plans, Medicare plans, and other sponsors of health benefit plans, and individuals throughout the United States.
During fiscal 2022, Medicare Part D payor revenue was approximately 56.1% of our Pharmacy Services Segment revenue, of which the largest single Medicare Part D payer was approximately 41.1% of our Pharmacy Services Segment revenue. During fiscal 2022, approximately 10.1% of our Pharmacy Services Segment revenue was to customers covered by Commercial payors.  During fiscal 2022, approximately 6.3% of our Pharmacy Services Segment revenue was to customers covered by Medicaid payors.
Competition
The retail drugstore and pharmacy benefit management industries are highly competitive. Some of our competitors are larger, better capitalized, have access to greater financial and other resources, are diversified through other industries and have an international presence. Additionally, some of our competitors are vertically integrated, allowing them to leverage healthcare, health plan, and PBM operations together with their retail pharmacy footprint. Increasingly, these competitors are expanding in our existing markets. Greater competition exerts pressure on our pricing and promotional models and may force us to modify or reduce our prices.
Our retail drugstore operations compete with, among others, retail drugstore chains, such as Walgreens and CVS, along with independently owned drugstores, supermarkets such as Kroger, mass merchandisers like Walmart and Target, discount stores, wellness offerings, dollar stores and mail order and internet pharmacies. We compete on the basis of store location, payor access, convenience, price, customer service, and product selection.
Our pharmacy benefit management company competes with other pharmacy benefit managers, such as Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx and mid-market PBMs. We will increasingly compete on the basis of our PBM service offerings flexibility, clinical offerings, network management, Rite Aid as an anchor (in Rite Aid markets), omni-channel consumer engagement and the strength of client facing teams.
We believe continued consolidation in the healthcare industry, and the aggressive pricing on front-end products by supermarkets and mass merchandisers and other PBM service providers will further increase competitive pressures in our industries.
Marketing and Advertising
In fiscal 2022, we advanced efforts to provide a seamlessly connected omni-channel customer experience. We continued to take a holistic approach to managing our media mix while shifting towards a digital-centric strategy. Marketing and advertising expense was approximately $146.1 million. This spend encompasses digital marketing to support pharmacy and front end sales, the wellness+ program and customer relationship marketing, in-store 

11



communication, weekly circular (print and digital), marketing campaign support including television, radio, and direct mail. During fiscal 2022, our marketing activities were primarily focused on the following:

● | Driving the awareness of COVID-19 vaccination and testing, as well as flu and ancillary immunizations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing to drive the awareness of the new Rite Aid brand through in-store, digital, broadcast, and print media. This was a significant portion of our marketing spend, and we continue to reinforce the new brand proposition into fiscal 2023. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supporting the launch of new items and brands as part of our merchandising refresh, including the support of new own brand items.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continued optimization of print media to drive marketing spend into more efficient and effective digital channels. We executed a multi-phase test and control program to determine where print advertising was less productive than digital spend, and adjusted marketing investment by channel throughout the year based on these learnings. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continued weekly promotional marketing as an important component of our marketing message mix, as we focused on promotions of items and categories that were most relevant to our customers during COVID-19.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supporting our previous loyalty program and launching our new Rite Aid Rewards as a component of our customer proposition.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supporting market-specific initiatives and individual store programs such as grand openings for new and remodeled stores, script file acquisitions, and store divestitures.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focused efforts on our omni-channel marketing initiatives including our Rite Aid mobile app, social media, our riteaid.com website and e-commerce.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additional programs focused on safety and convenience during the pandemic such as delivery and pickup.

Human Capital
Overview
​
As a pharmacy services company that operates in communities throughout the country and supports the whole health of millions of customers through our various lines of business, Rite Aid is positioned to make a meaningful difference in the lives of our customers. Our mission is to serve as the everyday care connector that drives lower health care costs through better coordination, stronger engagement and personalized services that help our customers achieve whole health for life. At the core of delivering on that mission is our associates. 
​
We believe our associates are integral to the success of our business transformation, through our RxEvolution strategy. In order to transform and grow our business, it is important for us to invest in our associates, giving them opportunities to grow professionally, care for themselves and their families, work in diverse and inclusive environments and be whole health ambassadors in their communities.
​
As of February 26, 2022, we employed over 53,000 associates across the United States, including Puerto Rico.
​
Communication and Engagement
​
Because our associates are so essential to our business strategy, we engage with them through formal surveys, town halls, focus groups and listening sessions to measure and understand their perspectives and gather critical feedback. For the past three years, more than 70% of our associates have participated in our surveys. The surveys give us valuable information regarding topics such as career development and growth, well-being, compensation, recognition, leadership and communication effectiveness, and opportunities specific to diversity and inclusion efforts. 

12



​
Training and Development
Growing and developing our talent is key to our future and our ability to lead at our best every day. We seek to inspire a high-performance culture and promote talent development. We offer development on leadership, safety, compliance and other critical skills necessary to run our business. We offer various instructor-led and virtual instructor-led programs and maintain a vast curriculum of relevant, on-demand learning and development resources. 
New to the company is a multi-year project to establish a foundation for how we hire and develop our associates through a competency framework. Working through key business partners, Success Profiles, skills identified to drive success within a particular role, have been established for our pharmacy & retail store associates. Moving forward the company will establish similar profiles for roles throughout the organization. Key offerings include learning modules and resources tied to the identified skills and structured career-pathing opportunities are planned.
We also provide discounted tuition and reimbursement programs for associates to pursue degrees at select colleges or universities as well as offering loan repayment assistance for pharmacy interns. We have been certified as an ACEP, Accredited Provider of Continuing Pharmacy Education, which allows us to offer courses that count toward the CE licensing requirements of our pharmacists. In addition, we offer an accredited pharmacy technician certification program. Both efforts allow us to develop pharmacy associates to meet the demands of our business.
​
Our goal is to grow leaders at all levels and provide associates opportunities to develop and grow the skills needed to meet personal goals and support Rite Aid’s future growth and success. 
​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
​
We continue to advance our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) programs as we enable our RxEvolution. We know that to build change that is meaningful and lasting, we must engage the unique perspectives, experiences and approaches that only come from a diverse workforce. We believe that an inclusive and welcoming workplace is not only desirable but essential, and we are committed to building a workplace in which every associate can thrive. So we are being intentional to bring to life to our DEI Commitment Statement which aligns with our values so that our associates know what behaviors we expect them to demonstrate and our customers, shareholders and other key stakeholders understand our aspirations. 
​
Our new DEI strategy roadmap will help us advance further in our DEI journey. It includes the integration of DEI into human resource policies as well as business processes to create measurable and sustainable improvements. For example, we implemented our Heritage and History Month services to celebrate Diversity, Equity and Inclusion throughout the year to cultivate a more inclusive work environment. We are also placing a strong emphasis on talent acquisition, development and management processes to grow a pipeline for future leaders with unique perspectives, experiences, and approaches. 
​
As of December 31, 2021, 68% of associates self-reported as female. In addition, associates reported their race/ethnicity as: White 54%; Hispanic 15%; Black 14%; Asian 12%; and Other 5%.
​
Total Rewards and Recognition
​
Our associates are critical to our business, and we design compensation, benefit and recognition programs to provide the appropriate security, support and appreciation needed for our associates to thrive. Included within the package of offerings for our associates are annual bonuses, 401(k) plans, healthcare benefits, paid time off, associate assistance programs, and many other services and programs for our eligible associates.
​
We also value and encourage associate recognition in order to celebrate outstanding contributions. Our recognition platform is a leadership tool used to celebrate the great achievements of our teams, reward and encourage exemplary behaviors aligned with our core values of Hustle with Humility, Earn Trust and Keep It and Get There Together and create a community experience for our workforce.

13



​
This past year we, like many other employers, experienced attraction and retention of talent challenges as the pandemic continued to place stress on the labor market. As a result, we developed many supplemental programs to assist with hiring and also extended additional recognition and pay elements to retain our talent. Some of the actions taken are as follows: referral bonuses, sign-on bonuses, recognition awards and bonuses and pay adjustments in hard to staff areas.
​
Research and Development
We do not make significant expenditures for research and development.
Licenses, Trademarks and Patents
The Rite Aid name is our most significant trademark and the most important factor in marketing our stores and private brand products. Additionally, we utilize important tradenames for our Elixir operations and the recently acquired Bartell Drugs. We hold licenses to sell beer, wine and liquor, cigarettes and lottery tickets. As part of our strategic alliance with GNC, we have a license to operate GNC “stores-within-Rite Aid-stores.” We also hold licenses to operate our pharmacies and our distribution facilities. Through our 100% owned subsidiary Elixir, we hold a license to conduct Medicare Part D business with CMS.
Collectively, these licenses are material to our operations.
Seasonality
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations concentrated in the first and fourth fiscal quarters as the result of the concentration of the cough, cold and flu season and the holidays. We tailor certain front-end merchandise to capitalize on holidays and seasons. We increase our inventory levels during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the seasonal fluctuations described above, including flu and other immunizations. Our results of operations in the fourth and first fiscal quarters may fluctuate based upon the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, both of which are unpredictable.
Regulation
Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices concerning the provision of and payment for health care services, including, without limitation: federal, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plan regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the ACA; regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), including regulations governing the purchase, sale, storing and dispensing of controlled substances, listed chemicals, and other products, as well as regulations promulgated by state and other federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and medicine, concerning automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, text messages and emails and the sale, advertisement and promotion of the products we sell, including nicotine products, drugs, medical devices, and alcoholic beverages. We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with our associates, including health and safety, minimum wage requirements, overtime, sick leave, working conditions, equal employment opportunity and unionizing efforts.
The legal environment affecting our business will continue to become more complex as new legal requirements and rules are introduced and existing laws are modified. Such legal changes could also create areas of uncertainty and require that we make material changes in our business operations and practices. Finally, any real or alleged non-compliance with these laws could materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.

Legal Developments Relating to COVID-19
As one of the federal legislative responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, Congress enacted the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the “Families First Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which require insurers and other payors to provide coverage for COVID-19 related medical services, in many cases without member cost-sharing. Pursuant to the government’s implementation of COVID-19 related legislation, the Company has received reimbursement for furnishing COVID-19 related testing, vaccinations, and monoclonal antibody treatment. We received provider relief funds under the CARES Act. We also elected to defer paying our employer share of Social Security tax payments for the period beginning March 27, 2020. We paid the first installment in December 2021 and plan to remit the second installment on or about December 31, 2022. 
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which was signed into law on March 15, 2021, authorized the government to spend approximately $1.9 trillion to address continued impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including approximately $415 billion in increased funding to cover the national vaccination program, COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, research and development, and medical supply manufacturing. Our business began offering COVID-19 testing services at various sites in April 2020 to eligible individuals based on CDC guidelines and vaccinations in its stores during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to eligible individuals based on state and local jurisdiction guidelines. We continue to offer COVID-19 testing services and vaccinations in our stores. With respect to providing COVID-19 testing services, we were not subject to or operated pursuant to waivers of certain obligations required of federal government contractors. However, going forward, our retail pharmacies will likely be subject to additional requirements of companies considered to be federal government contractors and shifting government requirements that may create obstacles for our retail pharmacies’ ability to continue offering testing services. For example, the regulations generally applicable to federal government contractors include those that require contractors to develop and implement affirmative action plans. If we become subject to these requirements, as we expect is likely, the Company will take steps to become compliant with those requirements as quickly as possible.
In addition to the above legislation, we have operated pursuant to a large number of new laws, regulations, and directives from federal, state, county, and city authorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although COVID 19-related mandates and directives are easing across the country and Congress is taking steps to reduce COVID 19-related funding, new more contagious COVID-19 variants, such as the Omicron variant and newly emerging BA.2 variant may necessitate the reintroduction of travel bans and restrictions, mask mandates, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and other stringent regulations. While there is uncertainty regarding the financial and operational impacts of COVID-19 related governmental actions and inactions, such impacts could be material and adverse or could require substantial and permanent changes in the Company’s operations. 
Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws 
Because we submit claims and other information to Medicare, Medicaid, and other government-sponsored health care programs, the Company is subject to various health care fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) and Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), of which many states have similar state counterparts, as well as the federal Physician Self-Referral Law (“Stark Law”), and the beneficiary inducement provision of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMPL”). Violations of these laws can result in various forms of sanctions, including civil and criminal fines, treble damages, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government-sponsored health care programs. FCA lawsuits can be initiated by the government or by individual whistleblowers who pursue qui tam actions on behalf of the government. In order to participate in government health care programs and mitigate our risks under the health care fraud and abuse laws, the Company maintains a compliance program. The Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has the authority to monitor our operations and compliance efforts through audits and investigations, and noncompliance can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from future participation in government programs. 
Medicare Laws and Regulations
We participate in the federal government’s Medicare Part D program as a stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (“PDP”) through our EI subsidiary, and our PBM business contracts to provide drug benefit administration services for 

15



other Medicare plans. Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state, and local regulations, including rules, guidance, memoranda, and updates published by CMS. This includes the governance set forth by the Medicare Part D program, which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible Medicare beneficiaries through private insurers. This program regulates the provision of Medicare outpatient prescription drug coverage, including enrollment, formularies, pharmacy networks, marketing, and claims processing. Some Medicare regulations, including those governing pharmacy network, benefit designs, and product pricing, have been and may continue to be modified. 
Even though the Social Security Act generally preempts state and local laws that relate to Medicare Part D, (including service providers like PBMs) states are increasing their regulatory authority over the Part D program, especially following a 2021 Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, which held that a North Dakota state law could regulate certain aspects of PBMs’ participation in Medicare Part D. The Court recognized that the scope of state regulatory authority extends to imposing certain mandates on Part D PBM relationships with their network pharmacies. 
Along with increasing state regulation over the Part D program, CMS could decrease Medicare reimbursement or increase fees imposed upon PDPs. Among other things, PDPs could be required to pay Medical Loss Ratio (“MLR”) rebates for failure to meet minimum MLRs in a given year and repeated failure to meet such minimum annual thresholds can serve as a basis for program termination by CMS. Because our Medicare plan clients are subject to these same regulations, if they are negatively impacted by legal noncompliance or unexpected reimbursement cuts, they could seek to terminate or renegotiate contractual arrangements with our Company. 
CMS assesses the quality of PDPs through star ratings, which may impact beneficiary enrollment numbers and sustained negative star ratings can result in plan termination. PDPs that fail or are unable to achieve or maintain star ratings can be terminated from Medicare.
Changes to the Medicare Part D program through the proposed Build Back Better Act could exert negative pressure on retail pharmacy reimbursement and limit the revenue for and the negotiating leverage of our Company’s PBM business. Among various other drug-related provisions, the Build Back Better Act would authorize government price negotiation for certain high cost Medicare drugs and cap Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket spending. The former policy change could reduce our retail pharmacy reimbursement within the Part D program and limit our retail pharmacies’ ability to negotiate favorable reimbursement rates. Moreover, such a pricing change could have a spillover effect in the commercial market, negatively impacting our PBM revenue and retail pharmacy reimbursement in the commercial market. Limitations on Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket spending could result in a shift of Part D costs from out-of-pocket spending and government subsidies to our PBM and other PBMs, resulting in reduced revenues to our PBM business and increased limitations on pharmacy reimbursement for our retail pharmacy segment. There is risk that even if the Build Back Better Act is not enacted, some of its policy provisions could be passed into law separately. 
Medicare sequestration cuts reduce federal funding to Medicare Part D plans. On December 10, 2021, President Biden signed the Protecting Medicare & American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, which extends the suspension of sequestration through March 31, 2022, then reduces the sequestration cuts to 1% from April 1 to June 30, 2022. The full 2% sequestration cuts will again take effect beginning July 1, 2022. The Protecting Medicare & American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act also delays certain other sequestration requirements, called PAYGO, that would have imposed a 4% cut in Medicare payments during 2022, until 2023. To the extent that Congress allows the sequestration cuts to take effect, government funding to Medicare Advantage and Part D Plans will be reduced, which in turn, may decrease revenue to our PBM business.
Medicare Enrollment Growth
In recent years, growth in Part D plan enrollment has been driven largely by growth in enrollment in Medicare Advantage and other Medicare managed plans that included Part D, while enrollment in stand-alone Part D plans has decreased over time and is expected to do so. Any increased drop in enrollment in stand-alone Part D plans or increased enrollment in Medicare Advantage or other Medicare managed care plans that offer Part D benefits may adversely affect our stand-alone Part D plan business.

Pharmacy, Professional Licensure, and Controlled Substance Laws and Regulations
We are subject to a wide range of statutes and regulations at the federal and state levels regarding the practice, licensure, and professional regulation of pharmacy and nursing. These statutes and regulations govern our retail, mail order, and specialty pharmacy operations, as well as the professional conduct of our pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurses, and physician assistants. Federal and state law also govern the issuance and filling of prescriptions, the dispensing of drug products (including those containing controlled substances) and the sale of schedule listed chemical products. The DEA has issued waivers of certain of its requirements regarding the prescribing, dispensing and distribution of controlled substances during the COVID-19 public health emergency. The end of the public health emergency and rescission of those waivers may have an impact on our customer base and may translate to a reduction in revenue for our pharmacy business.
Governmental agencies with regulatory authority to audit and/or investigate our Company’s operations in this area include, but are not limited to CMS, DEA, DOJ, FDA, state pharmacy boards, state nursing boards, state controlled substance regulators, and the state attorneys general. These agencies are authorized to impose criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions for failure to comply with these laws and regulations. A failure to comply with federal and/or state laws regarding the distribution or dispensing of products in violation of these laws may result in state enforcement actions, including, under an individual state false claims acts, Our pharmacy technicians who administer COVID-19 vaccines may receive immunity under the PREP Act (42 U.S.C. § 247d-6d) with respect to all claims for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from, the administration or use of FDA-authorized COVID-19 tests; however, such immunity does not extend to willful misconduct that results in serious injury or death.
HIPAA, Privacy, and Security Laws
Our business is also subject to patient and consumer privacy obligations. We are subject to the requirements imposed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as modified by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, including the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. As a HIPAA covered entity, we are required to implement privacy standards, train our associates on the permitted uses and disclosures of protected health information (“PHI”), report breaches of PHI, provide a notice of privacy practices to our pharmacy customers and permit pharmacy customers to access and amend their records and receive an accounting of disclosures of PHI. We are also subject to regulations governing the receipt of remuneration in exchange for PHI and are subject to audit for HIPAA compliance and failure to satisfy HIPAA standards may result in civil and criminal penalties. Corresponding state health privacy laws also apply to our business to the extent they are more stringent than HIPAA, and require additional obligations that may vary by state. These federal and state laws may change and require additional efforts.
Data Protection and Cybersecurity Laws 
Our business is subject to federal and state privacy and data security laws, with respect to our receipt, use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information (“PII”), which laws require us to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 invites business entities to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and directs HHS to create a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for health care entities. In addition, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which established numerous consumer rights including rights of access and deletion of consumer’s data upon request. The approved California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) with a January 1, 2023 compliance deadline amends and expands the CCPA. Virginia, Colorado, and Utah have enacted similar laws to provide for consumer privacy rights and protections. Other states are considering similar laws that would give consumers increased protection and control over their personal data. Other states have more limited protections for consumer data. In addition, certain states have data protection laws that provide for the protection of biometric data of individuals. The scope and reach of these biometric laws vary by state and may continue to change. Courts also may adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC that concern consumer notice, choice, security, and access. Likewise, a number of states that have passed data safeguard legislation, most notably New York’s Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security Act (the “SHIELD Act”), that requires any person or business owning or licensing computerized data that includes the private information of a resident of New York to implement and maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security, 

17



confidentiality, and integrity of the private information. We are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard promulgated by the payment card industry in connection with handling credit card data. This standard contains requirements devised to aid entities that process, store or transmit credit card information to maintain a secure environment.
Our business faces a significant compliance burden in seeking to satisfy federal as well as multiple and sometimes inconsistent state laws regarding privacy and data security. We further anticipate the introduction of new state data security laws that could increase our compliance burdens or negatively impact our future business plans and operations. Additionally, many of the public health insurance exchanges (“Public Exchanges”) governed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) impose their own privacy and security standards. Because these standards may impact downstream entities, such as PBMs, they may impose additional compliance burdens for our business.
Consumer Protection Laws 
In addition to the protection of personal data, our business is required to comply with other federal and state consumer protection laws. Applicable federal laws include the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Federal Postal Service Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Act. Our retail pharmacies and clinics are also subject to federal and state laws regarding the accessibility of goods and services to people with disabilities. Moreover, our website operations and electronic marketing and customer communications must be employed in compliance with certain consumer protection requirements. Under these laws, regulated entities may be subject to legal action and government investigations in regards to a wide array of customer-facing matters, including product pricing and expiration, disability access, and member loyalty and other financial incentive programs. 
Telemarketing and Other Outbound Contacts
The Company also engages in certain telemarketing activities that involve outbound phone calls, texts and emails. Accordingly, we are subject to various federal and state laws, including, but not limited to the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and similar state laws and the federal Telemarketing Sales Rule, under which federal and state regulators and private individuals may be authorized to take legal action and seek financial penalties for violations. 
The Affordable Care Act
Pursuant to the ACA, the Company’s PBM and PDP businesses, and its health plan clients, have been subjected to greater government oversight and regulation, including in relation to minimum MLR requirements, benefit plan design mandates, and group rating and pricing practices. Parts of the ACA continue to change over time through federal and state regulatory and policy actions and related litigation. Even though, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected another legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA, possibilities remain for future litigation challenging the ACA and/or the U.S. Congress to take action to repeal, modify, or expand the ACA in the future. While the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 increased federal subsidies for insurance obtained under the health exchange marketplace, this increase is temporary and it is unclear whether or not Congress will extend the subsidies beyond their current expiration date at the end of 2022. As a result, there is significant uncertainty regarding the ACA, potential future changes to the ACA and its ongoing impacts.
340B Drug Pricing Program 
Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which is overseen by HHS and the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), drug manufacturers are required to sell outpatient prescription drugs to certain safety net covered entities at discount prices. Drugs covered under the 340B Program may be dispensed by the covered entity or through contract pharmacies. In recent years, there has been litigation and enforcement actions regarding the dispensing of program drugs by contract pharmacies and the payment of mandatory 340B Program drug discounts by drug manufacturers. To the extent litigation and/or enforcement actions could restrict the scope of the 340B Program or contract pharmacy arrangements, our Company’s participation in the program could be significantly impacted. Congressional action with respect to the program might also have an impact. 

18



Environmental, Safety, Hazardous Materials Laws
In connection with the ownership and operations of our stores, distribution centers and other sites, we are subject to laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels relating to the protection of the environment, public health, and occupational safety matters, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations could result in fines or other government-imposed sanctions.
Pharmacy Network, Audit, and Plan Design Legislation 
Medicare Part D and many states have implemented “any willing provider” laws and related legal provisions that regulate the ability of drug benefit plans and PBMs to utilize limited pharmacy networks. In addition, an increasing number of states have imposed conditions restricting or modifying the ability of health plans and PBMs to audit pharmacies and recover overpayments. Finally, CMS and the various states may regulate the design and structure of prescription drug formularies with regard to Medicare Part D and ACA-regulated plans. Some of these regulations may limit the ability of PBMs and health plans to impose formulary conditions or restrictions, such as copayment differentials and drug tiering designs, which may be used to manage drug benefits and promote cost-efficient utilization. These laws can significantly affect the ability of PBMs to develop and enforce pharmacy networks, formularies, and other plan design features to manage costs and to effectively conduct audits aimed at recovering overpayments for our health plan clients. Additionally, an increasing number of states have passed legislation limiting the ability of PBMs and health insurers to provide special benefit structures for use with affiliated pharmacies. Such limitations could hinder the ability of our PBM to generate greater savings for insurer clients.
Medicare November 2020 Rebate Rule
Our Medicare PDP and PBM businesses could be impacted by the HHS final rule issued in November 2020, which would eliminate AKS safe harbor protection for rebates offered by drug manufacturers to PDPs and their contracting PBMs in exchange for formulary placement. The final rule would replace the previous safe harbor with two narrower safe harbors, one of which applies to certain point-of-sale rebates and the other to certain fixed service fees paid by manufacturers to PBMs. The final rule has been the subject of industry legal challenge, and in November 2021, pursuant to passage of the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act, its implementation date has been delayed until at least January 1, 2026. It is currently unclear whether the final rule will survive legal challenge and be implemented as currently drafted, or whether it will be struck down, modified, or rescinded. Moreover, even if implemented in its current form, it is unclear what the final rule’s resulting impact could be to the Company and its PBM and PDP businesses. 
Antitrust and Unfair Competition Laws 
The Company falls under the oversight of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and state regulatory authorities that are charged with investigating and enforcing laws relating to unfair and deceptive trade practices and “unfair methods of competition.” Some government investigations and prosecutions have focused on competitive and trade practices employed by PBMs with regard to vertical integration, rebates, drug pricing, and pharmacy reimbursement practices, as well as various other business practices of PBMs and retail pharmacies. The FTC has announced that it is seeking input under its Rule 6(b) authority on the scope of a potential study of various PBM practices that may impact the affordability of and consumer access to prescription drugs, with a view toward issuing a report, but the agency’s probe might also include possible rulemaking or issuance of an administrative complaint against PBMs.
In addition, the federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. Antitrust enforcement in the healthcare sector is currently a priority of the U.S. Department of Justice and the FTC. Violations of federal or state antitrust and unfair trade practices laws and regulations could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions, as well as potential liability in private civil litigation. 

19



FDA Regulation
The Company’s business operations include, among other things, the distribution and dispensing of prescription drugs, the sale of over-the-counter medications, including homeopathic drugs, and products, the private labeling of certain drug products and medical devices, and the sale of prepared food, all of which are regulated in whole or in part by the FDA. The FDA is authorized to impose various forms of sanction, including financial penalties, for failure to comply with regulations governing matters within its oversight. FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion regarding the marketing of certain homeopathic drugs without FDA approval and has indicated a willingness to continue to do so. However, a change in FDA’s enforcement posture could impact the Company’s product portfolio. A failure to comply with the FDA’s laws may result in enforcement or other legal action under state consumer protection laws.
ERISA Regulation and Preemption
Our PBM business provides prescription drug administrative services for various employer and union-sponsored health plans, in accordance with plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors. the Company must comply with the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) as well as implementing regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL) comprehensively regulating certain employee benefit plans that contract with us to provide PBM services as well as those plans’ service providers. In some cases, our PBM business may contract with a plan sponsor to assume specific limited ERISA fiduciary responsibilities, such as administration of initial appeals of prescription drug benefit claims. The Company may be subject to direct civil and/or criminal liability under ERISA and DOL regulations for any illegal remuneration provided to or received from plan sponsors.
ERISA generally preempts state and local laws that relate to employee benefit plans, including their service providers like PBMs, but the statute has been a frequent subject of litigation. The states have been aggressive in expanding regulation of PBMs following a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court decision rejecting ERISA preemption and upholding an Arkansas law designed to restrict the ability of PBMs to impose certain financial and operational parameters on network pharmacies. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, in November 2021, expanded on that decision, holding that a North Dakota law could legally regulate certain aspects of PBMs’ participation in Medicare Part D, including imposing certain mandates on PBM relationships with their network pharmacies. To the extent that future cases further limit ERISA’s preemptive scope, including expanding state law regulatory authority over Part D PBMs, our PBM business will be increasingly subject to state-imposed legal requirements and corresponding compliance costs.
PBM Laws and Regulations
Many states have implemented or are considering laws and regulations designed to more stringently regulate PBM activities, which may impact the ability of the Company to standardize its products for inter-state customers, thereby raising the cost of doing business. Those laws and regulations include various licensing and registration requirements for PBMs. Those regulations include imposing certain restrictions on pharmacy audits, transparency mandates, such as disclosure of data to third parties, drug utilization management practices, and restrictions on PBM pharmacy network design and dispensing channels. Some states have also passed legislation to create a reimbursement benchmark mandate, plus a set dispensing fee, for in-network pharmacies. 
An increasing number of states are regulating Maximum Allowable Cost reimbursement (“MAC”), which may be employed by PBMs to determine the reimbursement for dispensed generic pharmaceuticals and encourage plans to purchase generics at the lowest possible costs. State MAC laws are frequently designed to regulate MAC pricing methodologies, price transparency, the types of drugs subject to MAC pricing, and pricing appeals by pharmacies. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a broad opinion allowing states greater latitude to enact and enforce MAC laws. This decision will likely result in restrictions on the ability of PBMs to impose MAC pricing parameters to maximize cost efficiency, as well as possibly leading to more comprehensive regulation of MAC pricing by the states. As a result, our PBM may be subject to regulatory limitations on its ability to set favorable drug reimbursement rates.
In addition, various quasi-regulatory organizations and credentialing organizations have issued (or may propose) model standards or other requirements concerning PBMs, specialty pharmacies, or health plans. While these standards or requirements may not have the force of law, the resulting pressure to comply, in whole or in part, may be a 

20



significant cost for our PBM. Examples include the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), the National Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”), and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (“URAC”), among others. Cumulatively, these efforts could restrict PBMs’ leeway to manage costs and lead to greater inconsistency among state standards and laws, thereby increasing PBM compliance burdens.
PBMs are also subject to various federal and state fraud, waste, and abuse laws, including the FCA, AKS, and state false claims act and anti-kickback laws. Failure to comply with any of these laws could invite financial penalties and/or civil or criminal sanctions.
Government Agreements and Mandates
The Company may, from time to time, be subject to certain agreements or mandates imposed by federal, state, and local authorities in the form of consent orders, corporate integrity agreements, corrective action plans, and settlements. Currently, our business is subject to consent orders that pertain to information security, tobacco, pricing and product expiration dates.
Among other actions, the Company maintains a comprehensive security program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of personal information collected from or about our consumers. Compliance with these consent orders requires regular assessments and reports and our compliance activities may occasionally be subject to audit or inspection. Any failure to abide by the terms of these consent orders could result in civil, criminal, or administrative remedies or penalties.
Consumer Financial Laws 
The Company offers various financial products and services at certain of our retail store locations that include money (wire) transfer services, bill payment, money orders, check cashing, prepaid gift cards, and digital payment platforms. Accordingly, our business is subject to certain international, federal, and state anti-money laundering and consumer financial laws. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in civil and criminal penalties as well as reputational harm.
Corporate Governance and Internet Address
We recognize that good corporate governance is an important means of protecting the interests of our stockholders, associates, customers and the community. We have closely monitored and implemented relevant legislative and regulatory corporate governance reforms, including provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”), the rules of the SEC interpreting and implementing Sarbanes-Oxley and the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE.
Our corporate governance information and materials, including our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Corporate Governance Guidelines, the charters of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee, our Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and our Related Person Transaction Policy are posted on the corporate governance section of our website at www.riteaid.com and are available in print upon request to Rite Aid Corporation, 30 Hunter Lane, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania 17011, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Our Board of Directors will regularly review corporate governance developments and modify these materials and practices as warranted.
Our website also provides information on how to contact us and other items of interest to investors. We make available on our website, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, Extensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”) data files of our annual report and quarterly reports, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these reports with, or furnish them to, the SEC.
