ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 24, 2008 as JB Clothing Corporation. Until July 10, 2009, our principal business objective was the offering of active/leisure fashion design clothing.

On July 10, 2009 we abandoned our efforts in the field of active/leisure fashion design clothing when we acquired 100% of the share capital of Entest BioMedical, Inc., a California corporation, (“Entest CA”) from Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc. (“BMSN”) for consideration consisting of 10,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company and the cancellation of 10,000,000 shares of the Company owned and held by Mr. Rick Plote. On July 12, 2009, the Company changed its name to Entest BioMedical, Inc.

On June 18, 2015 Entest established Zander Therapeutics, Inc., a then wholly owned subsidiary. Zander was established to engage primarily in the development and commercialization of veterinary medical therapies which we intend to license from other entities as well as develop internally

The Company changed its name to Entest Group, Inc. on February 12, 2018.

On May 5, 2018, the Company declared the distribution on a pro rata basis as a dividend in kind of 3,000,000 of the common shares of Zander Therapeutics, Inc., par value $0.0001, currently owned by Entest Group, Inc

Shareholders of the Company received one (1) common share of Zander Therapeutics, Inc. for each 17 common and/or preferred shares of the Company held as of the record date. The distribution of the 3,000,000 common shares of Zander Therapeutics, Inc. to the common and preferred shareholders of the Company occurred on June 11, 2018.

As a result of the payment of the abovementioned property dividend, the Company’s percentage of ownership of Zander fell below 50% resulting in the deconsolidation of Zander and during the quarter ended November 30, 2018, the Company divested itself of its Zander stock.
