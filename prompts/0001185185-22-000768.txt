ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History



IGC has two business segments: Infrastructure and Life Sciences. We are a Maryland corporation established in 2005 with a fiscal year that is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on March 31.
Infrastructure Segment 



The India based infrastructure segment involves the execution of construction contracts.



Life Sciences Segment



Biopharmaceutical: Since 2014, this part of our business has focused primarily on the potential uses of phytocannabinoids, including Tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) and Cannabidiol (“CBD”), in combination with other compounds to treat multiple diseases, including Alzheimer’s. As a company engaged in the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical industry, we focus our research and development efforts, subject to results of future clinical trials, on seeking pharmaceutical solutions that may a) alleviate neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, and depression associated with dementia in Alzheimer’s disease; and b) halt the onset, progression, or cure Alzheimer’s disease. We currently have one investigational new drug candidate, “IGC-AD1”, in a Phase 2 clinical trial for agitation in dementia from Alzheimer’s. IGC-AD1 is a cannabis-based compound, which is made up of ultra-low doses of THC along with another compound as active ingredients. The second molecule, TGR-63, is an enzyme inhibitor that has been shown, in pre-clinical trials, to reduce neurotoxicity in Alzheimer’s cell lines. Neurotoxicity causes cell dysfunction and death in Alzheimer’s disease. If shown to be efficacious in halting this process, this inhibitor has the potential to treat Alzheimer’s disease by ameliorating Aβ plaques.
Over the Counter Products: We have created a cannabinoid-based women’s wellness brand, Holief™ available through online channels and a CBD-caffeine-infused energy drink, Sunday Seltzer™, available through wholesale channels.

Alzheimer’s disease



The National Institute on Aging (“NIA”) at the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) defines Alzheimer’s as an irreversible progressive brain disorder that destroys memory and thinking skills. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, approximately 10% of Americans over 65 have Alzheimer’s disease and many more could be undiagnosed. Some researchers suspect that half of the 80 and over population will develop Alzheimer’s (Piedmont Healthcare, (n.d); Alzheimer’s Association, 2021). Alzheimer’s is the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and cancer. (NIA, 2019). The Alzheimer’s crisis is growing and by 2030, World Health Organization (“WHO” 2020), estimates that 55 million people worldwide will have dementia. With no approved cure the global cost of dementia is expected to rise to about $2.8 trillion by 2030.



Dementia is a broader term used to describe the loss of cognitive functioning, including thinking, remembering, reasoning, and behavioral abilities. The WHO believes Alzheimer’s may be responsible for up to 70% of dementia. Alzheimer’s disease, and the dementia associated with it, is a progressive disease. Symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance (sundown syndrome), delusions, and hallucinations often begin to appear in patients in their mid-60s.

The NIA categorizes Alzheimer’s in three stages - mild, moderate, and severe (NIA, 2019). Symptoms of mild Alzheimer’s can include wandering (getting lost, not remembering the way home), trouble handling money and paying bills, repeating questions, and personality or behavior changes. As the disease progresses to moderate, there is damage to the areas of the brain that control language, reasoning, sensory processing, and conscious thought. Patients can have difficulty with multistep tasks such as getting dressed. Behavioral problems including hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and impulsive behavior can also increase. When severe Alzheimer’s sets in, plaques and tangles spread throughout the patient’s brain and the brain shrinks significantly. People with severe Alzheimer’s are completely dependent on others for care. They cannot communicate, and near the end of their life, they may be largely bed-ridden as the body shuts down (NIA, 2021).



Currently, there are limited options to help Alzheimer’s patients with the debilitating symptoms of the disease or relief for the burden placed on their caregivers (Cheng, 2017). Our Phase 1 trial for IGC-AD1 may provide hope for those patients suffering from mild to severe dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease.



Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) Pathology



Alzheimer’s pathology can be divided into two categories, familial or inherited AD and sporadic AD. The histopathology of early onset familial AD and late onset sporadic AD are indistinguishable. Both forms of AD are characterized by extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (Gӧtz, et al., 2011). Simplistically, in normal brain functioning a large protein called Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is cleaved into smaller fragments called Aβ proteins. In a normal brain these are subsequently broken down further and cleared. However, in AD brains these Aβ proteins are not broken down and cleared; they instead stick to one another, and deposit as inter neuronal sticky plaque—that is, they deposit as plaque between neurons. In the brain, within a neuron tau (τ) is a key protein that holds together the transport scaffold. As an analogy, it is the brick and mortar of the highway over which nutrients are transported within a neuron. In an AD brain, tau breaks down due to a process called hyperphosphorylation and is unable to hold the transport highway. The breakdown results in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and eventually leads to neuronal death.



The misfolded structure of Aβ proteins, along with NFTs, generate a characteristic tendency for their aggregation (Chiti & Dobson, 2006) around damaged or dead neurons and within cerebral vasculature in the brain. It manifests by memory loss followed by progressive dementia. It has long been believed that Aβ1–40 (Aβ40) and Aβ1–42 (Aβ42) aggregates are the constituents of the insoluble plaques that are characteristic of AD. This disease is also associated with neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress (Campbell & Gowran, 2007; Rich, et al., 1995). However, the continuous aggregation of Aβ proteins along with hyperphosphorylation of tau protein inside the cell, causing NFT formation, are generally accepted as the major etiological factors of the neuronal cell death associated with the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (Octave, 1995; Reitz, et al., 2011; Pillay, et al., 2004).



IGC-AD1 Studies on Alzheimer’s



While investigating cannabinoid-based combination therapies, researchers at the University of South Florida (“USF”) discovered the potential for cannabis to play a role in treating Alzheimer’s. The discovery was featured on Dr. Sanjay Gupta’s CNN show Weed 2. This work also led to several patent filings including one that was granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). In the fiscal year 2018, IGC acquired exclusive rights to the research data and patent filing. The research on the active ingredients of IGC-AD1 (IGC-AD1 Actives) showed that they, in combination, had potentially positive effects on Alzheimer’s disease. Specifically, the pre-clinical research on the IGC-AD1 Actives showed the following:



Impact on plaque levels:  Cao et al., (2014) reported a dose-dependent decrease in Aβ40 levels in N2a/APPswe cells (AD cell lines) in the presence of the IGC-AD1 Actives, after 24 hours of incubation. Furthermore, repeated exposure reduced Aβ40 levels without changing APP levels, a novel non-obvious and important finding as APP is a key protein associated with brain functioning. The mode of action is attributed to its direct interaction with Aβ protein and inhibition of Aβ aggregation (Cao et al., 2014).



Impact on Tau Protein: IGC-AD1 Actives lowered the level of phosphorylated Tau (pTau) expression in N2a/APPswe cells in a dose-dependent manner. The mode of action was attributed to the direct interaction of IGC AD1 Actives with GSK3 protein kinase, which lowers pTau expression (Cao et al., 2014).



Impact on neurotoxicity: Analysis on the neurotoxicity at various doses in N2a/APPswe cells after incubation for up to 24 hours showed that the Actives were non-toxic to cells at all doses (Cao et al., 2014).



Impact on Mitochondria: In a novel and non-obvious finding it was discovered that THC in low doses has the unique property of enhancing mitochondrial functioning in isolated mitochondria obtained from N2a/AβPPswe cells (Cao et al., 2014). This finding is contrary to what THC does at higher doses, alluding to a bi-phasic nature of THC.

Results with a mouse model: Cao’s group extended their in vivo study to aged APP/PS1 mice to evaluate THC’s neuroprotective effects on behavioral models. They used a radial arm water maze (RAWM) to test spatial memory. RAWM tests revealed that treating aged APP/PS1 mice with low doses of THC for three months increased their spatial learning skills in a dose-dependent way (Wang et al., 2022).



Based on the evidence, we hypothesize that IGC-AD1 may have several AD modifying benefits, including:




● | Reduction in Aβ expression without a reduction in APP.
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduction in Aβ aggregation and consequently plaques.
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhanced mitochondrial functioning.
--+------------------------------------


● | Reduction in the phosphorylation of tau and consequently a reduction in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Research has shown that micro-dosing of THC could increase the functioning of mitochondria on AD cell lines and potentially promote the growth of new pathways (neurogenesis) (Suliman, et al., 2017). Micro-dosing of THC affects the brain radically differently from the normal dosing in the FDA-approved prescription drug, Dronabinol. For example, there is a significant body of research showing that THC is neuro-toxic at normal levels, but micro-doses of THC have been shown to be non-toxic to neurons. With the exciting results of these pre-clinical studies, the Company developed an oral formulation, IGC-AD1, and completed a Phase 1 trial on AD patients.



IGC-AD1 Clinical Trial Data



To the best of our knowledge, the Company’s Phase 1 clinical trial testing the safety and tolerability of IGC-AD1 is the first human clinical trial using low doses of THC, in combination with another molecule, to treat symptoms of dementia in Alzheimer’s patients. THC is a naturally occurring cannabinoid produced by the cannabis plant. It is known for being a psychoactive substance that can impact mental processes in a positive or negative way depending on the dosage. THC is biphasic, meaning that low and high doses of the substance may affect mental and physiological processes in substantially different ways. For example, in some patients, low doses may relieve a symptom, whereas high doses may amplify a symptom. IGC’s trial is based on low dosing and controlled trials on patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.



A double blind, single-site, randomized, three cohort, multiple-ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial (FDA IND Number: 146069, NCT04749563) was conducted using the investigational new drug (IND) IGC-AD1. IGC received approval to proceed with the Phase 1 clinical trial from the FDA on July 30, 2020. The primary objective was safety and tolerability in elderly patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. The secondary objective was measuring changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) using the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) as well as to assess the risk of suicide using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The exploratory objective was to measure the pharmacokinetics (PK) and the impact of polymorphisms of the gene CYP2C9 on PK. In all three cohorts, ten participants received IGC-AD1 and two received a placebo. There were at least four days of washout between the cohorts. In Cohort one, Cohort two, and Cohort three the doses were q.d. (once per day), b.i.d. (twice per day), and t.i.d. (three times per day), respectively. The trial concluded that all three dosing levels were safe with no serious or life-threatening events or deaths reported.



On December 1, 2021, IGC submitted the Clinical/Statistical Report (CSR) to the FDA on its Phase 1 trial titled “A Phase I Randomized Placebo-Controlled MAD Study to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of IGC-AD1 In Subjects with Dementia Due to Alzheimer’s Disease.” Data that is relevant to the Phase 1 protocol and the design of the Phase 2 trial are presented here. The data presented here is not exhaustive.



Primary Endpoint: Safety & Tolerability (S&T)



S&T was assessed by recording both solicited and non-solicited Adverse Events (AEs). The solicited AEs, assessed daily, were somnolence, falls, dizziness, asthenia, suicidal ideation, hypertension, psychiatric symptoms, and paradoxical nausea. All AEs were graded as mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, and serious (SAE).



● In all three Cohorts, a) there were no SAEs, b) no life-threatening AEs, and c) no deaths.



● One AE, mild dizziness, reported in Cohort 1, was deemed to be related to IGC-AD1. All other AEs across all cohorts were deemed to be not related to IGC-AD1 or to the placebo.



● In Cohort 1, in the group that received IGC-AD1 (N=10), 50% reported hypertension, 40% reported asthenia, 30% reported somnolence and dizziness, 20% reported psychiatric symptoms, and 10% reported falls. One case of dizziness was deemed by the principal investigator (PI) to be related to IGC-AD1. In the placebo group (N=2) 100% reported hypertension, and 50% reported somnolence and falls.

● In Cohort 2 for the IGC-AD1 group, 60% reported psychiatric symptoms, 50% reported somnolence and asthenia, 30% reported hypertension, 20% reported nausea and dizziness, and 10% reported falls and suicidal ideation. In the placebo group 100% reported somnolence, 50% reported dizziness and hypertension.



● In Cohort 3 for the IGC-AD1 group, 70% reported somnolence, 60% reported psychiatric symptoms, 50% reported dizziness and asthenia, and 30% reported hypertension. In the placebo group 100% reported somnolence, and 50% reported hypertension and psychiatric symptoms.



Secondary Endpoints: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)



Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (NPS) such as delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, sleep disorders, and appetite/eating disorders are prevalent in patients who have Alzheimer’s disease (Phan et al., 2019). NPS in Alzheimer’s is a significant burden on patients and caregivers, and at some point, in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, more than 97% of patients suffer from at least one symptom. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (Cummings et al., 1994) measures the severity of each symptom and establishes both individual symptom scores as well as an overall NPI score. Separately, the NPI also scores caregiver distress (NPI-D). The NPI is used by about 50% of neurologists to assess and treat Alzheimer’s patients (Fernandez et al., 2010).



In the Phase 1 trial conducted on patients with Alzheimer’s disease, we measured changes in NPS as assessed by the NPI-12 as well as caregiver distress as assessed by the NPI-D. In the Phase 1 trial (N=10), seven received the active medication and at baseline they had symptomatic Agitation with domain scores between two and twelve. In Cohorts two and three six Participants had symptomatic Agitation. We measured and analyzed the change in the mean NPI score for Agitation between Day 1 and Day 10 and between Day 1 and Day 15 for all three cohorts.




● | As shown in Table below, our analysis shows Cohort 2 had the largest absolute change in the mean Agitation score between Day one and Day ten (53% drop, p=.085) as well as between Day 1 and Day 15 (67% drop, p=.05).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Table 1: NPI analysis for each of the three cohorts




Domain | Cohort 1 (n=7) | Cohort 2 (n=6) | Cohort 3 (n=5)
-----------------+----------------+----------------+---------------
Agitation | Baseline | Day | Day | Baseline | Day | Day | Baseline | Day 10 | Day 
Day 0 | 10 | 15 | Day 0 | 10 | 15 | Day 0 | 15 
Mean Score | 4.7 | 3.3 | 3 | 4.3 | 2.1 | 1.5 | 4.2 | 3.2 | 1.4 
Mean Change | - | 1.4 | 1.7 | - | 2.2 | 2.8 | - | 1 | 2.8 
Mean Change% | - | 37% | 48% | - | 53% | 67% | - | 23% | 67% 
p-values | - | 0.058 | 0.045 | - | 0.085 | 0.05 | - | 0.29 | 0.045
P(T<=t) two-tail | | | | | | | | | 




According to the NPI Test, a reduction of 4 points or 30% in the score is considered clinically meaningful. In addition, we also used a paired 2-tailed t-test with 9 degrees of freedom to assess the statistical significance of the decrease both in the overall NPI and individual NPI domains.



● In Cohort 1 for those on IGC-AD1, the mean NPI decreased from a baseline 31.5 (SD 27.2) to 16.7 (SD 16.2) on day 10 (p = 0.0044) and 14.8 (SD 16.0) on day 15 (p = 0.0095).



o Individual domains that showed improvement were in Agitation (p = .05), Dilutions (p = .05), Anxiety (p = .09), and Appetite and Eating Disorders (p = .01).



● In Cohort 2 for those on IGC-AD1, the mean NPI decreased from a baseline of 22.2 (SD 14.8) to 10.4 (SD 11.5) on day 10 (p = 0.0026) and 12.4 (SD14.7) on day 15 (p = 0.0127).



o Individual domains that showed improvement were Agitation (p = .06), Irritability (p = .04), and Depression (p = .01).

● In Cohort 3 for those on IGC-AD1 the mean NPI decreased from a baseline of 16.0 (SD14.7) to 14.6 (SD10.9) on day 10 (p = 0.6751) and 7.9 (SD 9.0) on day 15 (p = 0.0113).



o Individual domains that showed improvement was Agitation (p = .06).



Phase 2 Clinical Trial Update



The Company has initiated a protocol titled “A Phase 2, Multi-Center, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo- controlled, trial of the safety and efficacy of IGC-AD1 on agitation in participants with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease”. The protocol is powered at 146 Alzheimer’s patients with half receiving placebo and is a superiority, parallel group study. While subject to changes, we expect to conduct the trial at four sites, two in Canada and two in the U.S. The primary end point is agitation in dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease as rated by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) over a six-week period. The Phase 2 trial will also look at eleven exploratory objectives, including, changes in anxiety, changes in cognitive processes such as attention, orientation, language, and visual spatial skills as well as memory, changes in depression, delusions, hallucinations, euphoria/elation, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, sleep disorder, appetite, quality of life, and caregiver burden. In addition, the trial will evaluate the impact of CYP450 polymorphisms and specifically CYP2C9 on each of the NPS and assess any reductions in psychotropic drugs, among others. Each participant will receive two doses of IGC-AD1 (b.i.d.) or two doses of placebo per day for six-weeks.
Rationale For IGC-AD1 Phase 2



The rationale for targeting agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer’s:



Currently, there is no approved medication for agitation associated with dementia in AD, and about 76% of AD patients suffer from agitation as rated by the CMAI (Van der Mussele, et al., 2015). While there can be no guarantee, we expect the Phase 2 trial to take between 12 and 18 months to complete, barring a variety of unknown factors such as a resurgence of COVID and the enforcement of lockdowns and travel restrictions.



Symptoms of AD depend on the stage of the disease: preclinical, mild, moderate, or severe. NPS like agitation, apathy, delusions, hallucinations, and sleep impairment are common accompaniments of dementia. Loss of functionality, including progressive difficulty in performing instrumental and basic activities of daily living are also seen with disease progression (Tang et al., 2019). There is a spectrum of behavioral disorders that can affect patients with AD. These include Agitation (including “sundown syndrome”), anxiety, disturbance of sleep cycle, depression, inappropriate sexual behavior, disinhibition, and irritability, among others (Lyketsos et al., 2011). These behavioral disturbances not only affect patient’s quality of life but also cause extreme emotional distress for the caregivers. These disturbances can become very difficult to manage, so most of the time, combinational therapy is used (Matsunaga, et al., 2015). This can cause secondary undesirable effects, such as excessive sleepiness, which diminishes the capability of the patient to be active and alert during the day; dizziness, which can increase the risk for falls (Allan, et al., 2005); worsening of cognitive function, which in turn worsens functionality (Paterniti S, et al., 2002); and even death due to cardiovascular complications (Qiu, et. Al., 2006).



NMI Compounds 



Researchers at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (“JNCASR”), in India, conducted approximately 10 years of research and discovery work on naphthalene monoimide (“NMI”) compounds and the role of NMI compounds on neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer’s. In Alzheimer’s patients, neurotoxicity is linked to beta amyloid (Aβ) plaques and Neuro Fibrillary Tangles (NFT). JNCASR’s research based on Alzheimer’s cell lines identified one lead NMI molecule, TGR-63, from a family of NMI molecules, with the potential to reduce beta amyloid (Aβ) plaques. Further, they demonstrated that the molecule reduces cognitive decline in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s. Their results were published in Advanced Therapeutics under the title “Naphthalene Monoimide Derivative Ameliorates Amyloid Burden and Cognitive Decline in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease” on January 28, 2021.



On November 11, 2021, Hamsa Biopharma India Pvt. Ltd. (“Hamsa Biopharma”), a directly owned subsidiary of the Company, executed a Term Sheet with JNCASR, and on March 28, 2022, entered into an agreement for exclusive global rights corresponding to the molecules, technology, patent, and patent filings. The completion of outstanding items in the agreement occurred on May 10, 2022, and the agreement with JNCASR was filed on Form 8K on May 12, 2022. Pursuant to the agreement, IGC (through Hamsa Biopharma) acquired exclusive global rights to the molecule, which it intends to pursue as a drug development candidate, subject to further study, research, and development.

Rationale for the Acquisition of TGR-63



As described above, IGC is currently engaged in human trials with IGC-AD1 that targets certain symptoms associated with dementia in Alzheimer’s. IGC-AD1 is currently being tested as a symptom modifying agent. Subject to further study, research, and development, TGR-63, on the other hand, could give the Company a potential disease modifying agent to expand the Company’s pursuit of a drug that can potentially treat or modify Alzheimer’s.



Intellectual Property



Our goal is to use our intellectual property (“IP”) to develop products that we can bring to market in one or more of the following channels:



1. Pharmaceutical products that are subject to FDA-approvals. We currently have one Alzheimer’s symptom modifying investigational drug candidate (IGC-AD1) in Phase 2 clinical trials under an INDA filed with the FDA, and a potential Alzheimer’s disease modifying drug development candidate (TGR-63) in a pre-clinical stage.



2. Branded wellness and lifestyle products to be sold in multiple retail and online channels, subject to applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.



3. Partnerships and licensing agreements with third parties who can accelerate bringing our IP to market.



The Company holds all rights to the patents that it filed with the USPTO. In Fiscal 2017, the Company also acquired exclusive rights to the data and the patent filing from USF. Subsequent to Fiscal 2022, the Company acquired exclusive rights to the data and the patent filing from JNCASR.



The Company believes the registration of patents is an important part of its business strategy and future success. However, the Company cannot guarantee that these patent filings will lead to a successful registration with the USPTO. Please see Item 1A, Risk Factors- “We may not successfully register the provisional patents with the USPTO.”

COVID-19 Update



The infrastructure business, based in India and Hong Kong, had significantly lower revenue in Fiscal Year 2022 due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions imposed by governmental entities. We have limited visibility into when economic conditions will recover in India and Hong Kong. Specifically:

1. | We incurred increased expenses on a $1.2 million road-building contract in India due to COVID-19 restrictions. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | We manufactured, distributed, and donated alcohol-based hand sanitizers to help communities hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. We incurred the expense to provide hand sanitizers to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”), the Navajo Nation in Arizona, the Crow reservation in Montana, and the Sioux reservation in South Dakota.
3. | Pandemic restrictions made it impossible to transport and process our harvested hemp crop in Arizona on a timely basis. This resulted in a $1.7 million adjustment to our inventory that also impacted our SG&A. 

Products & Services



In Fiscal 2022, we created and began marketing two brands, Holief™ and Sunday Seltzer™, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Our brands generated $287,000 in revenue. Although there can be no assurance, we believe these brand concepts have significant potential in the growing cannabinoid-based wellness and lifestyle market. However, COVID-19 did force the Company to delay and limit the marketing of our brands that include Holief™ and Sunday Seltzer™:
Holief™



In Fiscal 2022 we completed the development and branding of Holief™. The word “Holief” was created by combining the words “holistic” and “relief.” The brand includes multiple, hemp-based CBD-infused products for women. Holief™ includes a patented formulation with menthol and CBD, for treating the pain and symptoms of Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and period cramps. These products provide an all-natural alternative to opioids and other pain medications. The Holief™ product line includes creams, gummies, and herbal extracts. Additional plant-based ingredients that have been shown to relieve PMS symptoms such as primrose oil and peppermint oil are included in many Holief™ formulations. Holief™ is developing a cloud-based platform to connect the 31.3 million women (Statista, 2021) that suffer dysmenorrhea and PMS with health care professionals who can help. The products are available online and through Amazon and other online channels.
Sunday Seltzer™



In Fiscal 2022 the Company completed the development and branding of Sunday Seltzer™, a premium hemp-based CBD infused seltzer. Sunday Seltzer™ is an all-natural, organic, carbonated energy drink with natural caffeine from green tea extract, CBD, vitamins B, vitamin C, no added sugars, and no preservatives. The energy drink is available in two flavors, pomegranate-lemon, and peach-ginger. In addition, Sunday Seltzer™ is available in four flavors with no caffeine.



Infrastructure segment



The Company’s infrastructure business has been operating since 2008, it includes: (i) Execution of Construction Contracts – The Company is executing a $1.2 million road-building contract in Kerala, India and was recently awarded another road reconstruction project for $289 thousand; and (ii) Rental of Heavy Construction Equipment – We rent equipment, such as a motor grader and rollers, to construction contractors. There was minimal revenue from rentals in Fiscal 2022 due to seasonality and COVID-19 pandemic disruptions.



Business Strategy

We believe developing a drug for either symptoms or as a disease modifying agent has considerable risk due to the need for multi-year trials and FDA approval. However, there is considerable upside and significant value creation to the extent we obtain first-to-market advantage, of which there can be no assurance. If we were to obtain first-to-market advantage, such advantage could result in significant growth if and when an approved drug launches. Our Holief™ strategy includes expanding the line of products and developing online services that connect women with healthcare professionals who can help with PMS and dysmenorrhea. Building an online community that brings women together can create brand equity and loyalty.



We believe that additional investment in clinical trials, research, and development (“R&D”), facilities, marketing, advertising, and acquisition of complementary products and businesses will be critical to ongoing growth of the Life Sciences segment. These investments will fuel the development and delivery of innovative products that drive positive patient and customer experiences. We hope to leverage our R&D and intellectual property to develop ground-breaking, science-based products that are proven effective through clinical trials, subject to FDA approval. We believe this strategy can improve our existing products and lead to the creation of new hemp-based products that can provide treatment options for multiple conditions, symptoms, and side effects.



Our Infrastructure strategy includes:




● | competitively bidding on construction contracts, such as building roads, bridges, and other civil works in Kerala, India, and;

Markets and Distribution



Life Sciences segment



There is a growing awareness around the perceived benefits of CBD-infused personal care products. U.S. sales of cannabis and hemp-derived CBD products are expected to increase in all channels—dispensary, general retail, and pharmaceutical, to $20.5 billion by 2025, a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of more than 40% (BDSA, 2020). With diversified CBD-based brands in multiple markets, including infused seltzer (Sunday Seltzer™) and pain relief (Holief™), we are well positioned to take advantage of these market trends. The U.S. cannabis-infused drink market is expected to reach $1.4 billion by 2023 (Statista, 2020). Approximately 31.3 million (Statista, 2021) women in America suffer from dysmenorrhea and PMS.



Our Life Sciences revenue is less than 1% of the relevant global market, which implies tremendous opportunity for growth. We also plan to market these brands to the fast-growing U.S. Hispanic and Latino market. It is projected that the Hispanic and Latino population will grow from 59 million with a GDP of $2.6 trillion in 2018 to 111.22 million by 2060 (Statista, 2021).



In Fiscal 2022, our sales and suppliers were concentrated which represents some risk. One customer accounted for over 10% of sales. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect our operations and result in lower revenue and/or higher costs in Fiscal 2023.



Infrastructure segment



In Fiscal 2022, our infrastructure business focused on projects in the state of Kerala. While executing this construction project, we took advantage of other opportunities to generate revenue from our infrastructure assets. We also lease our small fleet of heavy construction equipment, including grader, rollers etc. to construction companies.



Our infrastructure business revenue is less than 1% of the global revenue of the rental, construction, and commodities markets. We currently have 1 customer and 1 subcontractor/supplier of infrastructure materials. Our ability to grow is limited by the disruption to the Hong Kong economy and the impact of COVID-19. If and when the economy recovers, there is potential opportunity for growth given the total size of the market.



Business Seasonality



The infrastructure segment has historically experienced seasonality with limited construction work available during the monsoon season. The hemp business also has seasonality as most of the hemp harvest in America occurs in the fall. Pricing pressure is based on the volume of hemp biomass being harvested.

Competition



Competition for the Company’s products and services varies by market:



1. Life Sciences segment: We are developing affordable medical products including products subject to FDA approval, which can help individuals suffering from debilitating diseases like Alzheimer’s. While we face competition from well-funded pharmaceutical companies, our products are differentiated by the use of cannabinoids. With our existing research, patent filings, and experienced team we have an early-mover advantage in cannabinoid-based products to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s. Our wellness and lifestyle products compete with multiple well-established companies, in the food, beverage, and skincare industries. We also face competition from companies with experience in wholesaling hemp crude extract and hemp isolate as well as companies that provide white labeling and tolling services. It is unclear how future FDA guidance and ruling on hemp-based CBD-infused food, beverage, and cosmetic products will impact the market.



2. Infrastructure segment: The infrastructure industry in India and Hong Kong is highly competitive. Our differentiation is based primarily on price and local and industry knowledge of construction requirements in the regions where we operate.



Regulatory



Despite the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA has not established guidance or rules on the infusion of hemp-based CBD into food and beverage products. This creates a complicated framework of local rules and regulations that we must navigate. When federal rules are clearly set, we expect the demand for CBD-based food and beverages will increase. We also believe competition will increase as major food and beverage manufacturers will enter the market.



Core business competencies and advantages



Our core competencies include:




● | a network of doctors, scientists with Ph.D. degrees, and intellectual property legal experts with a sophisticated understanding of drug discovery, research, FDA filings, intellectual protection, and product formulation; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | knowledge of various cannabinoid strains, their phytocannabinoid profile, extraction methodology, and impact on various pathways; 
● | knowledge of plant and cannabinoid-based combination therapies; 
● | knowledge of research and development in the field; 
● | patents IGC-501, IGC-502, IGC-504, and IGC-507 for treatment of pain, treatment of seizures in humans and veterinary animals, treatment of cachexia and eating disorders in humans and veterinary animals, and Alzheimer’s Disease, respectively; and 
● | facilities and a team with experience in manufacturing, marketing, and selling products. These competencies have enabled us to make progress on our business goals, specifically completing the Phase 1 clinical trial of IGC-AD1, which has the potential to positively impact the lives of millions of patients suffering from the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, subject to FDA approval.

Licenses, Technology, and Cybersecurity



We have intellectual property attorneys that advise, counsel, and represent the Company regarding the filing of patents or provisional patent applications, copyrights applications, and trademark applications; trade secret laws of general applicability; employee confidentiality and invention assignment. Most of our data, including our accounting data, is stored in the cloud which helps us mitigate the overall risk of losing data. We have a cybersecurity policy in place and are in the process of implementing tighter cybersecurity measures to safeguard against hackers. The Company holds all rights to the patents that have been filed by us with the USPTO.

Governmental Regulations 



In the U.S. we are subject to oversight and regulations, for some or all of our activities, by the following agencies: SEC, state regulators, NYSE, FTC, and the FDA. The cannabis plant consists of several strains or varieties. Hemp and Marijuana are both cannabis plants. Under the 2018 Farm Bill, Hemp is classified as a cannabis plant that has 0.3% or less THC by dry weight. Marijuana is classified as a cannabis plant that has THC above 0.3% by dry weight.



Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, including in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized for medical and or recreational use. On the other hand, the 2018 Farm Bill, which was effective January 1, 2019, contains provisions that make industrial hemp legal. Although hemp is legal at the federal level, most states have created licensing and testing processes for the growing, processing, and sale of hemp and hemp-derived products.



For our business, we must apply for licenses in states where we desire to grow and process hemp. For example, in the state of Arizona, where we grew hemp, we were required to apply for licenses and register with the state the geo-location of all our operations, including the land on which hemp was grown and the facilities where hemp will be processed. These regulations are evolving, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to change.



FDA Approval Process



In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern the research, development, testing, manufacturing, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring, and reporting, sampling, and importing and exporting of pharmaceutical products, among other things. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the imposition of clinical holds, FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (“NDA”), warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.



Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. typically involves pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests and the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. For commercial approval, the sponsor must submit adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show that the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling. The sponsor must also submit substantial evidence, generally consisting of adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to establish that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling. In certain cases, the FDA may determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical study plus confirmatory evidence. Satisfaction of FDA premarket approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity of the product, or disease.



 14

 



Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including the FDA’s good laboratory practices regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (“USDA’s”) regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act. The results of pre-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.



A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not imposed a clinical hold on the IND or otherwise commented or questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.



Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.



The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions.



Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In general, in Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. The FDA may, however, determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical study plus confirmatory evidence. Only a small percentage of investigational drugs complete all three phases and obtain marketing approval. In some cases, the FDA may require post-market studies, known as Phase 4 studies, to be conducted as a condition of approval in order to gather additional information on the drug’s effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Depending on the risks posed by the drugs, other post-market requirements may be imposed.



After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial.



The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the statute and implementing regulations, the FDA has 180 days (the initial review cycle) from the date of filing to issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter, unless the review period is adjusted by mutual agreement between the FDA and the applicant or as a result of the applicant submitting a major amendment. In practice, the performance goals established pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act have effectively extended the initial review cycle beyond 180 days. The FDA’s current performance goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90 percent of standard (non-priority) NDAs within 10 months of receipt and within six months for priority NDAs, but two additional months are added to standard and priority NDAs for a new molecular entity (“NME”).



 15

 



The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with the current GMP is satisfactory, and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.



After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing 90 percent of resubmissions within two to six months depending on the type of information included.



An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained, or problems are identified following initial marketing.



Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information



Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of the investigation, study sites and investigator and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years if the sponsor certifies that it is seeking approval of an unapproved product or that it will file an application for approval of a new indication for an approved product within one year. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.
The Hatch-Waxman Act



Orange Book Listing



In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent the claims of which cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for the marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are considered to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug, are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug in accordance with state law.



The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date, and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement, certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.



 16

 



A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.



Exclusivity



Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking approval of a drug that references a version of the NCE drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that includes the change.



An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification and thus no ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.



For a botanical drug, the FDA may determine that the active moiety is one or more of the principal components or the complex mixture as a whole. This determination would affect the utility of any five-year exclusivity as well as the ability of any potential generic competitor to demonstrate that it is the same drug as the original botanical drug.



Five-year and three-year exclusivities do not preclude FDA approval of a 505(b)(1) application for a duplicate version of the drug during the period of exclusivity, provided that the 505(b)(1) applicant conducts or obtains a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.



Patent Term Extension



After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase — the time between IND submission and NDA submission — and all of the review phase — the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not

exceed 14 years.



For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the PTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.



Orphan Drugs



Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. (or affects more than 200,000 in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. of such drug). Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. If the FDA designates an orphan drug based on a finding of clinical superiority, the FDA must provide a written notification to the sponsor that states the basis for orphan designation, including “any plausible hypothesis” relied upon by the FDA. The FDA must also publish a summary of its clinical superiority findings upon granting orphan drug exclusivity based on clinical superiority. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.



 17

 



Special Protocol Assessment



A company may reach an agreement with the FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”), process as to the required design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. According to its performance goals, the FDA is supposed to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record. Under the FDC Act and FDA guidance implementing the statutory requirement, an SPA is generally binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy after the study begins, public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, the sponsor and the FDA agree to the change in writing, or if the study sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA.



U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement



Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of our lead product candidates, such as IGC-AD1 or any other for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the U.S. will depend in part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction, or denial by payors.



The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. Medicare Part D, Medicare’s outpatient prescription drug benefit, contains protections to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oral oncology products, and all Part D prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all oral anti-cancer agents. However, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Sales of products such as IGC-AD1 or any other product candidates will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payors. Achieving favorable coverage and reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and/or the Medicare Administrative Contractors is typically a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product.



Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
