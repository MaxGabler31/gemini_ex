Item 1. Business
Overview
 MEI Pharma, Inc. is a late-stage pharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of novel cancer therapies intended to improve outcomes for patients. Our portfolio of drug candidates has four clinical-stage assets, including zandelisib (f/k/a ME-401), currently in multiple ongoing clinical studies intended to support marketing applications with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other regulatory authorities globally. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “MEIP.”
 Our approach to building our pipeline is to license or acquire promising cancer agents and build value in programs through development, commercialization and strategic partnerships, as appropriate.
 In January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 outbreak”) and the risks to the international community. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. As a result of the ongoing and rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic, various public health orders and guidance measures have been implemented across much of the United States, and across the globe, including in the locations of our office, clinical trial sites, key vendors and partners. Despite the relaxation of many governmental orders earlier this year, COVID-19 still impacts the normal conduct of business. In addition, although the FDA authorized vaccines for the treatment of COVID-19, and although a significant portion of the U.S. population has been vaccinated, the vaccination rate of the population and the effectiveness of the vaccines, particularly with respect to the COVID-19 Delta variant, as well as other variants, continues to create uncertainty. Furthermore, the COVID-19 virus may continue to mutate into different strains, which could be more contagious or severe or for which current vaccines and treatments are not effective or available.
While we continue to enroll and dose patients in our clinical trials, certain of our clinical trials have been delayed due to COVID-19 and our clinical development program timelines may continue to be subject to potential negative impacts from the ongoing pandemic in the U.S. and globally. The extent to which the ongoing pandemic continues to impact our business, including our preclinical studies, chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) studies, manufacturing, and clinical trials, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness and timing of distribution of treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease and to minimize its economic impact, including vaccination rates and effectiveness.
 We may experience enrollment delays and suspensions, patient withdrawals, postponement of planned clinical or preclinical studies, redirection of site resources from studies, and study deviations or noncompliance. We may also need to maintain or implement study modifications, suspensions, or terminations, the introduction of additional remote study procedures and modified informed consent procedures, study site changes, direct delivery of investigational products to patient homes or alternative sites, which may require state licensing, and changes or delays in site monitoring. The foregoing may require that we consult with relevant review and ethics committees, Institutional Review Boards ("IRBs"), and the FDA. The foregoing may also impact the collection, tabulation, analysis and integrity of our study data. The COVID-19 outbreak may further increase the need for clinical trial patient monitoring and regulatory reporting of adverse effects, may impact trial data collection and recording at the clinical research sites, and may delay regulatory authority meetings, inspections, or the regulatory review of marketing or investigational applications or submissions.
 Not only might the continuing COVID-19 pandemic impact the conduct of our clinical trials, but it may also impact our ability to procure the necessary supply of our investigational drug products, as well as any ancillary supplies necessary for the conduct of our studies. This could happen for a variety of reasons, including manufacturing shortages or shutdowns, or a manufacturer need to prioritize other products or customers over us, including under the Defense Production Act. Third party manufacturers may also need to implement measures and changes, or deviate from typical manufacturing requirements that may otherwise adversely impact our product candidates.
 In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, the FDA issued a number of new guidance documents. Specifically, as a result of the potential effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on many clinical trial programs in the U.S. and globally, the FDA issued guidance concerning potential impacts on clinical trial programs, which guidance the FDA has continually updated. In addition, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) as well as various country regulatory authorities (EU and UK) have issued similar guidance. We have adapted the FDA and EMA/UK guidance for study procedures, data collection, and oversight resulting from the pandemic.
 Although the U.S, federal government has implemented various economic stimulus programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, none of such programs have had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.


Clinical Development Programs
 We build our pipeline by licensing or acquiring promising cancer agents and creating value in programs through development, commercialization and strategic partnerships, as appropriate. Our objective is to leverage the mechanisms and properties of our pipeline drug candidates to optimize the balance between efficacy and tolerability to meet the needs of patients with cancer. Our drug candidate pipeline includes:
 •Zandelisib (f/k/a ME-401), an oral phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (“PI3K”) delta inhibitor; 
 •Voruciclib, an oral cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (“CDK9”) inhibitor; 
 •ME-344, a mitochondrial inhibitor targeting the oxidative phosphorylation (“OXPHOS”) complex; and
 •Pracinostat, an oral histone deacetylase (“HDAC”) inhibitor.
        1.Phase 2 study intended to support accelerated approval marketing applications with the FDA. 
 2.Study arm initiated under clinical collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd. 
 3.Investigator-initiated trial. 
 4.Initiation of clinical studies is subject to opening of a new Investigational New Drug Application ("IND") with the FDA.
 Zandelisib (f/k/a ME-401): PI3Kδ Inhibitor in Multiple Trials Intended to Support Marketing Approvals in Relapsed or Refractory Follicular and Marginal Zone Lymphomas
 Zandelisib is an oral, once-daily, selective PI3Kδ inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. In March 2020, the FDA granted zandelisib Fast Track designation for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (“r/r”) follicular lymphoma (“FL”) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. In April 2020, we entered into a global license, development and commercialization agreement to further develop and commercialize zandelisib with Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. (“KKC”). MEI and KKC will co-develop and co-promote zandelisib in the U.S., with MEI recording all revenue from U.S. sales. KKC has exclusive commercialization rights outside of the U.S.
We are conducting multiple ongoing studies evaluating zandelisib. Our studies include TIDAL, a Phase 2 study evaluating zandelisib as a monotherapy in patients with r/r FL and marginal zone lymphoma (“MZL”) patients who have received at least two prior lines of treatment. Enrollment in the FL primary efficacy population of TIDAL completed in April 2021; enrollment of the MZL arm remains ongoing. Subject to the results, data from TIDAL is intended to support submissions for accelerated approval marketing applications with the FDA in r/r FL and MZL patients receiving at least two prior lines of treatment.
 Also ongoing is COASTAL, a Phase 3 study evaluating zandelisib in combination with rituximab in patients with r/r FL and MZL who have received at least one prior line of treatment. COASTAL is intended to support full marketing applications in the U.S. and globally in r/r FL and MZL patients receiving at least one prior line of treatment. COASTAL is also intended (subject to FDA agreement) to act as the required confirmatory study for the potential U.S. accelerated approvals of zandelisib based on the TIDAL study.

We are also conducting a multi-arm, open-label, Phase 1b dose finding and expansion trial evaluating zandelisib as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Other initiated studies include Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies being conducted by KKC evaluating zandelisib as a monotherapy in patients in Japan with indolent B-cell malignancy pursuant to our agreement with KKC.
 Zandelisib: Potentially Highly Differentiated Pharmaceutical Properties within a Clinically Validated Class of Treatments
 While PI3Kδ inhibitors as a group are a clinically validated class for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, the FDA approved orally administered products, idelalisib (marketed as Zydelig®), duvelisib (marketed as COPIKTRA®), umbralisib (marketed as UKONIQ), and the intravenously administered PI3Kδ/α inhibitor copanlisib (marketed as Aliqopa®), are challenged by dose-limiting toxicities, modest efficacy and/or inconvenience of administration route. We believe this provides an opportunity for the development of a next-generation candidate with pharmaceutical properties that may better maximize the therapeutic potential of PI3Kδ inhibition by limiting toxicities and improving upon modest efficacy, which together hinder clinical utility.
The molecular structure and pharmacodynamic characteristics of zandelisib are distinct from the FDA approved PI3Kδ inhibitors. Zandelisib’s distinct characteristics include prolonged target binding, preferential cellular accumulation, high volume of distribution throughout the body tissues, and an approximately 28-hour half-life suitable for once daily oral administration. The properties of zandelisib support exploration of flexible dosing regimens such as an intermittent dosing schedule, which has clinically demonstrated to date the potential to maintain clinical benefit while minimizing immune-related toxicities common to other PI3Kδ agents, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapies.
KKC License, Development and Commercialization Agreement
 In April 2020, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with KKC (the “KKC Commercialization Agreement”). We granted to KKC a co-exclusive, sublicensable, payment-bearing license under certain patents and know-how controlled by us to develop and commercialize zandelisib and any pharmaceutical product containing zandelisib for all human indications in the U.S., and an exclusive (subject to certain retained rights to perform obligations under the agreement), sublicensable, payment-bearing, license under certain patents and know-how controlled by us to develop and commercialize zandelisib and any pharmaceutical product containing zandelisib for all human indications in countries outside of the United States (the “Ex-U.S”). KKC grants to us a co-exclusive, sublicensable, license under certain patents and know-how controlled by KKC to develop and commercialize zandelisib for all human indications in the U.S., and a co-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid license under certain patents and know-how controlled by KKC to perform our obligations in the Ex-U.S. under the KKC Commercialization Agreement. The KKC Commercialization Agreement substantially retains and consolidates the terms of the 2018 license agreement with KKC to develop and commercialize zandelisib in Japan.
 KKC will be responsible for the development and commercialization of zandelisib in the Ex-U.S. and, subject to certain exceptions, will be solely responsible for all costs related thereto. We will co-develop and co-promote zandelisib with KKC in the U.S., with the Company recording all revenue from U.S. sales. We will share U.S. profits and costs (including development costs) on a 50-50 basis with KKC. We will also provide to KKC certain drug supplies necessary for the development and commercialization of zandelisib in the Ex-U.S. pursuant to supply agreements to be entered into on customary terms, with the understanding that KKC will assume responsibility for manufacturing for the Ex-U.S. as soon as practicable.
 Under the terms of the KKC Commercialization Agreement, KKC paid us an initial payment of $100 million. We may also earn up to approximately $582.5 million in potential development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments, plus royalties on net sales of zandelisib in the Ex-U.S., which are tiered beginning in the teens.
 Zandelisib Scientific Overview: at the Crossroads of B-cell Signaling Pathways
 The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is an important signaling pathway for many cellular functions such as cell survival, cell cycle progression and cellular growth. PI3Ks are a family of enzymes within this pathway that have been shown to play a critical role in the proliferation and survival of certain cancer cells.
There are several isoforms of PI3K that are expressed in different types of cells. The PI3Kδ isoform is at the crossroads of B-cell receptor signaling pathways that are major drivers of survival and proliferation of many B-cell malignancies. Because the δ isoform is often overexpressed in cancer cells of the B-lymphocyte lineage, such as B-cell leukemias and lymphomas, it is understood to be important for survival of these cells. Zandelisib displays high selectivity for the PI3K delta isoform and functions to inhibit its activity.
Clinical Program Overview
 We are conducting multiple ongoing studies evaluating zandelisib including TIDAL, a global Phase 2 trial evaluating patients with r/r FL and MZL with at least two prior of lines of therapy that is intended to support FDA marketing applications for accelerated approval. Also ongoing is COASTAL, a global Phase 3 study evaluating patients with r/r FL and MZL with at least one prior line of therapy that is intended to support full marketing authorization with the FDA as well as regulatory authorities globally.
Additionally, we are conducting a multi-arm, open-label, Phase 1b dose escalation and expansion trial as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies in patients with FL and other B-cell malignancies. The Phase 1b trial includes an arm exploring zandelisib in combination with zanubrutinib (marketed as BRUKINSA®), an inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase developed by BeiGene, Ltd. (“BeiGene”). This study arm completed the safety evaluation stage in patients with B-cell malignancies and has expanded into disease specific B-cell malignancy cohorts. The evaluation of zandelisib in combination with zanubrutinib is conducted under a collaboration established with BeiGene in October 2018, pursuant to which the cost of the combination trial is being equally shared, and each company is supplying its own investigational agent. We retain all commercial rights to zandelisib (subject to the KKC Commercialization Agreement) and BeiGene retains all commercial rights to zanubrutinib.
Ongoing clinical trials also include Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies conducted by KKC evaluating zandelisib as a monotherapy in patients in Japan with indolent B-cell malignancies. The Phase 2 study is intended to support marketing authorization in Japan.
 In addition to other planned clinical studies sponsored by us, such as initiation of a Phase 2 study evaluating zandelisib plus venetoclax in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ("CLL"), we also plan to support select investigator-initiated studies, including one being conducted at the Cleveland Clinic evaluating zandelisib combined with standard of care in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”).
 Phase 1b Multi-arm Trial
 In May 2021, we reported updated data from the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating zandelisib as a monotherapy and in combination with rituximab and zanubrutinib in patients with r/r FL and other B-cell malignancies as featured in poster discussions at the American Society of Clinical Oncology ("ASCO") 2021 annual meeting.
 Data were reported from 37 patients with r/r FL administered zandelisib 60 mg once daily for two 28-day cycles and then on an intermittent schedule (“IS”) of once daily dosing for the first seven days of each subsequent 28-day cycle. The objective of this data presentation was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of zandelisib as monotherapy or in combination with rituximab in patients with FL who had disease progression within 24 months after initial chemoimmunotherapy ("POD24") or disease progression beyond 24 months ("non-POD24").
The overall response rate in the 37 patients with r/r FL was 87%, with 27% achieving a complete response. The overall response rate was 78% in 18 patients administered zandelisib as a monotherapy and 95% in 19 patients administered zandelisib in combination with rituximab. The overall response rate in nine evaluable patients with CLL, previously reported separately, was 89%.
Overall Response Rates (“ORR”)
    
 | POD24n = 22 | Non-POD24n = 15 | Total FLn = 37
Overall response rate (ORR) | 18 (82%) | 14 (93%) | 32 (87%) 
Regimen | | | 
Monotherapy | 8/11 (73%) | 6/7 (86%) | 14/18 (78%) 
Combination with rituximab | 10/11 (91%) | 8/8 (100%) | 18/19 (95%) 
Prior lines of therapy | | | 
1 prior | 5/7 (71%) | 9/9 (100%) | 14/16 (88%) 
≥ 2 prior | 13/15 (87%) | 5/6 (83%) | 18/21 (86%) 
CR rate, n (%) | 4 (18%) | 6 (40%) | 10 (27%) 

 Median duration of response in the 37 patients with FL, as reported in a poster presentation at the 16th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma, has not yet been reached, and median follow-up was 16.9 months (range: 1.2 to 33.1 months). Responses appeared durable across patient subsets analyzed (prior lines of therapy (1 vs ≥ 2), treatment group (i.e., monotherapy or in combination with rituximab) or tumor bulk (< 5 cm vs ≥5 cm)).


Duration of Response: Follicular Lymphoma Patients
    
Zandelisib was generally well-tolerated. The rate of drug related grade 3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (“AESI”) in the 37 patients with r/r FL was: diarrhea 5% (2/37); colitis 5% (2/37); rash 8% (3/37); alanine aminotransferase (“ALT”)/ aspartate aminotransferase (“AST”) elevation 8% (3/37); The discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 8% (3/37).
 Data from the arm of the Phase 1b study evaluating 20 patients receiving zandelisib in combination with zanubrutinib was also reported in a poster session at the ASCO 2021 Annual Meeting. In this arm of the study two treatment dosing regimens were explored: Group A received zandelisib 60 mg, oral, daily continuously for eight weeks followed by days 1-7 of each subsequent 28-day cycle, and zanubrutinib, 160 mg oral, twice daily; Group B received zandelisib 60 mg, oral, daily on days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle starting Cycle 1 and zanubrutinib 80 mg, oral, twice daily. Group A enrolled a total of seven patients: one FL, three CLL, one MZL, one mantle cell lymphoma ("MCL"), and one diffuse large B-cell lymphoma/high grade B-cell lymphoma ("DLBCL/HGBCL"). Group B enrolled a total of 13 patients: seven FL, two CLL, one MZL, and three DLBCL/HGBCL. Treatment was continued until disease progression, intolerance or withdrawal of consent.
 The overall response rate in all evaluable patients with r/r indolent B-cell malignancies and CLL was 100%. No response was noted in the two patients with DLBCL/HGBCL. Responses were durable with median follow up for all patients was 6.6 months (0.6 to 21.3 months) with the majority of responders still on treatment.
    Overall Response Rate
 
Evaluablen = 18 | FL(n = 8) | CLL/SLL(n = 5) | MZL(n = 2) | MCL(n = 1) | DLBCL/HGBCL(n = 2)
ORR*, n (%) | 8 (100%) | 5 (100%) | 2 (100%) | 1 (100%) | 0 (0%) 
Group A | 1 (100%) | 3 (100%) | 1 (100%) | 1 (100%) | 0 (0%) 
Group B | 7 (100%) | 2 (100%) | 1 (100%) | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) 

 
*CR/CRi in two of eight patients with FL (25%) and in two of five patients with CLL (40%).
Imaging scans were taken at months 3, 7, 13, and then every six months until disease progression. Response reported based on Lugano criteria and International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ("iwCLL"). Two of 20 patients (one in DLBCL and one in HGBCL) did not have on-therapy scans. One patient had clinical progressive disease ("PD") and one patient had adverse events ("AE") due to prior therapy and discontinued early. Median follow-up time was 6.6 months for all patients (range 0.6 to 21.3 months), 3.6 months for Group A (range 0.6 to 21.3 months), and 6.6 months for Group B (range 1.9 to 14.1 months).
 Group B, which received zandelisib 60 mg orally, daily on days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle starting Cycle 1 and zanubrutinib 80 mg, orally, twice daily, was well tolerated across the various B-cell malignancies in the completed part of the study. The combination administered on the optimized, Group B, dosing regimen did not result in additive toxicity to each agent alone. One of the two patients with Grade 3 AST/ALT increases in Group B was successfully retreated and continued therapy.
       
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Special Interest
 
Grade 3-4 AESI, n (%) | Group A(n = 7) | Group B(n = 13)
ALT / ALT increased | 2 (29%) | 2 (15%) 
Rash | 1 (14%) | 0 (0%) 
CMV colitis | 1 (14%) | 0 (0%) 
Pneumonia | *1 (14%) | 0 (0%) 
Diarrhea | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) 
Atrial fibrillation | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) 

 * 1 DLBCL patient had several Grade 3 AEs on Day 1 attributed to prior therapy and discontinued treatment on Day 17.
 The Phase 1b study is continuing to enroll expansion cohorts in r/r FL and r/r MCL to further evaluate the combination of zandelisib 60 mg administered on days 1-7 starting Cycle 1 and zanubrutinib administered at 80 mg twice daily.
 TIDAL: A Phase 2 Trial Intended to Support Accelerated Approval of Marketing Applications
 TIDAL is a global Phase 2 trial evaluating zandelisib as a monotherapy across two study arms: the first study arm for the treatment of adults with r/r FL and the second study arm for r/r MZL, in both cases after failure of at least two prior systemic therapies including chemotherapy and an anti-CD20 antibody. Subject to the results and discussions with the FDA, data from each study arm are intended to be submitted to the FDA to support marketing applications for accelerated approval. The study is evaluating zandelisib administered once daily at 60 mg for two 28-day cycles and then on an intermittent schedule of once daily dosing for the first seven days of each subsequent 28-day cycle (i.e., IS). The primary efficacy endpoint will be the rate of objective responses to therapy and other endpoints will include duration of response and tolerability of zandelisib. The primary efficacy population sample size for r/r FL is 91 patients and the primary efficacy population sample size for r/r MZL is 64 patients. Total study enrollment in the FL arm will be 120 patients to provide additional safety data for the registration application. Enrollment of the FL arm of the TIDAL study is complete.
COASTAL: A Phase 3 Trial Intended to Support Full FDA and Global Marketing Authorizations
 COASTAL is a global, randomized, two-arm Phase 3 trial comparing zandelisib plus rituximab to standard of care chemotherapy plus rituximab, in patients with r/r FL or MZL who received at least one prior line of therapy, which must have included an anti-CD20 antibody in combination with chemotherapy or lenalidomide. COASTAL is expected to enroll 534 patients. Zandelisib will be administered once daily for two 28-day cycles followed by an intermittent schedule of once daily dosing for seven days of each subsequent 28-day cycle for a total of 24 months, in combination with rituximab (R) in the first six months only. The control arm will consist of six cycles of the standard chemoimmunotherapy regimens R-CHOP or R-bendamustine. The primary efficacy endpoint is progression-free survival; secondary endpoints include overall response rate, overall survival, patient reported outcomes assessments, and safety and tolerability.
COASTAL is intended to support full marketing applications in the U.S. and globally in r/r FL and MZL patients who have received at least one prior line of treatment. COASTAL is also intended (subject to FDA agreement) to act as the required confirmatory study for the potential U.S. accelerated approval of zandelisib based on the ongoing Phase 2 TIDAL study evaluating patients with r/r FL and MZL patients who have received two or more prior lines of treatment.
Impact of COVID-19 on the TIDAL and COASTAL Studies
 The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the progress of the zandelisib development program, including the enrollment and completion of the COASTAL and TIDAL studies, is subject to future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Currently, we believe that the integrity of the program and individual studies remains intact; however, the pandemic did have a negative impact on the rate of enrollment in the TIDAL study. The development program remains ongoing and is continuing to enroll patients, although enrollment may potentially occur at a reduced rate. Topline data from the Phase 2 TIDAL study is expected in the fourth calendar quarter of 2021. We will continue to closely monitor for potential negative impacts on the development program related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We will also continue efforts to be proactive in managing the impact from the pandemic, including various actions to communicate with sites and investigators, and making accommodations to patients consistent with FDA guidance and guidance from other regulatory authorities, as we may deem appropriate.
Voruciclib: CDK Inhibitor with CDK9 Inhibition in Phase 1 Studies
Voruciclib is an orally administered CDK inhibitor differentiated by its potent in vitro inhibition of CDK9 in addition to CDK6, 4 and 1. Voruciclib is being evaluated in a Phase 1b trial evaluating dose and schedule in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) and B-cell malignancies. Voruciclib is also being evaluated in pre-clinical studies to explore the potential synergistic activity in various solid tumor cancers of voruciclib in combination with drug-candidates that directly inhibit KRAS as well as other targets in the RAS signaling pathway.
 Voruciclib Scientific Overview: Cell Cycle Signaling
 CDK9 has important functions in cell cycle regulation, including the modulation of two therapeutic targets in cancer:
 •CDK9 is a transcriptional regulator of the myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein ("MCL1"), a member of the family of anti-apoptotic proteins which, when elevated, may prevent the cell from undergoing cell death. Inhibition of CDK9 blocks the production of MCL1, which is an established resistance mechanism to the B-cell lymphoma ("BCL2") inhibitor venetoclax (marketed as Venclexta®).
 •CDK9 is a transcriptional regulator of the MYC proto-oncogene protein ("MYC") which regulates cell proliferation and growth. Upregulation of MYC is implicated in many human cancers and is frequently associated with poor prognosis and unfavorable patient survival. CDK9, in addition to being a transcription factor for MYC, also decreases phosphorylation of MYC protein that is implicated in stabilizing MYC in KRAS mutant cancers. Targeting MYC directly has historically been difficult, but CDK9 is a promising approach to target this oncogene.
Voruciclib: Inhibition of MCL1
 In pre-clinical studies voruciclib shows dose-dependent suppression of MCL1; in December 2017, a study of voruciclib published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports reported that the combination of voruciclib plus the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax was capable of inhibiting two master regulators of cell survival, MCL-1 and BCL-2, and achieved synergistic antitumor effect in an aggressive subset of DLBCL pre-clinical models.
 Additionally, a peer reviewed manuscript published in 2020 by Luedtke et al, concluded that the inhibition of CDK9 by voruciclib synergistically enhances cell death induced by the Bcl-2 selective inhibitor venetoclax in preclinical models of acute myeloid leukemia.
 The research presented suggests that voruciclib could be an attractive therapeutic target for treating cancers in combination with venetoclax or other BCL-2 inhibitors.
 Voruciclib: Inhibition of MYC
 KRAS mutated cancers are frequently associated with overexpression of MYC, a transcription factor regulating cell proliferation and growth. CDK9 is a known regulator of MYC transcription and a modulator of MYC protein phosphorylation. Data reported at the American Association for Cancer Research ("AACR") Annual Meeting 2021 in preclinical models demonstrates that voruciclib:
 •Results in a rapid decrease in the phosphorylation of proteins that promote MYC transcription;
 •Rapidly decreases phosphorylation of MYC protein on Ser62, a site implicated in stabilizing MYC in KRAS mutant cancers;
 •Possesses single agent activity against multiple KRAS mutant cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo;
 •Synergistically inhibits KRAS G12C mutant cancer cell lines in combination with KRAS G12C inhibitors, both in vitro and in vivo.
 The research presented suggests that voruciclib could be an attractive therapeutic target for cancers driven by KRAS mutations.
 Clinical Program
 We are evaluating patients with hematological malignancies in a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating the dose and schedule of voruciclib. The trial is initially intended to evaluate the dose and schedule of voruciclib as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell malignancies and AML after failure of prior standard therapies to determine the safety, preliminary efficacy and maximum tolerated dose. Once initial dose levels and schedules have been established, we plan in parallel, subject to FDA agreement, to evaluate the dose and schedule of voruciclib in combination with a BCL2 inhibitor such as venetoclax to assess synergies and the opportunity for combination treatments, initially in patients with AML and subsequently across multiple indications.
 Preliminary data to date from the Phase 1b study evaluating voruciclib as a monotherapy at the doses studied demonstrates that voruciclib has not been associated with drug related gastrointestinal toxicity or neutropenia. Also, favorable pharmacokinetics have been observed, including a half-life supporting once-a-day oral dosing and dose proportional C-max. Our projections suggest that doses of 150-200 mg may be sufficient to achieve plasma concentrations sufficient to inhibit the molecular target. Early signs of biological activity have also been observed in patients with AML.
 Voruciclib was also previously evaluated in more than 70 patients with solid tumors in multiple Phase 1 studies. The totality of the clinical data, along with data from pre-clinical studies, suggests voruciclib’s ability to inhibit its molecular target at a projected dose as low as 150 mg daily. In one clinical study, voruciclib was evaluated in combination with vemurafenib (marketed as Zelboraf®) in nine patients with

BRAF mutated advanced/inoperable malignant melanoma. Three of three BRAF/MEK naive patients achieved a response: two partial responses and one complete response. In this study voruciclib was dosed at 150 mg daily plus vemurafenib 720 mg or 960 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. The most common adverse events were fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, arthralgia and headache. One instance of grade 3 fatigue was dose limiting and no serious adverse events related to voruciclib were reported. Other clinical studies evaluated voruciclib at doses up to 850 mg in patients with solid tumors, demonstrating additional evidence of potential biologic activity and an adverse event profile generally consistent with other drugs in its class.
 Impact of COVID-19 on the Voruciclib Clinical Development Program
 While the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the progress of the voruciclib clinical development program, including the ongoing Phase 1b study, is subject to future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, the study remains ongoing and is continuing to enroll patients; however, the rate of enrollment of patients has been negatively impacted by the pandemic. We will continue efforts to be proactive in managing the impact from the pandemic, including various actions to communicate with sites and investigators, and making accommodations to patients consistent with FDA guidance as we may deem appropriate.
ME-344: Clinical Stage Mitochondrial Inhibitor with Combinatorial Potential
 ME-344 is our novel and tumor selective, isoflavone-derived mitochondrial inhibitor drug candidate. It directly targets the OXPHOS complex 1, a pathway involved in adenosine triphosphate ("ATP") production in the mitochondria. ME-344 was studied in an investigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized clinical trial in combination with the vascular endothelial growth factor (“VEGF”) inhibitor bevacizumab (marketed as Avastin ®) in a total of 42 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (“HER2”) negative breast cancer.
ME-344 Scientific Overview: Cancer Metabolism
 Tumor cells often display a high metabolic rate to support cell division and growth. This heightened metabolism requires a continual supply of energy in the form of ATP. The two major sources of ATP are the specialized cellular organelles termed mitochondria and through the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids.
 ME-344 was identified through a screen of more than 400 new chemical structures originally created based on the central design of naturally occurring plant isoflavones. We believe that some of these synthetic compounds, including our drug candidate ME-344, interact with specific mitochondrial enzyme targets, resulting in the inhibition of ATP generation. When these compounds interact with their target, a rapid reduction in ATP occurs, which leads to a cascade of biochemical events within the cell and ultimately to cell death.
 Clinical Program
 ME-344 demonstrated evidence of single agent activity against refractory solid tumors in a Phase 1 trial, and in pre-clinical studies tumor cells treated with ME-344 resulted in a rapid loss of ATP and cancer cell death. In addition to single agent activity, ME-344 may also have significant potential in combination with anti-angiogenic therapeutics. In pre-clinical studies, it was shown that one outcome of anti-angiogenics was to reduce the rate of glycolysis in tumors as a mechanism to slow tumor growth. However, tumor metabolism was able to shift to mitochondrial metabolism for energy production to support continued tumor proliferation. In such cases of tumor plasticity in the presence of treatment with anti-angiogenics, targeting the alternative metabolic source with ME-344 may open an important therapeutic opportunity.
Support for this combinatorial use of ME-344 was first published in the June 2016 edition of Cell Reports; pre-clinical data from a collaboration with the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre in Madrid demonstrated mitochondria-specific effects of ME-344 in cancer cells, including substantially enhanced anti-tumor activity when combined with agents that inhibit the activity of VEGF. These data demonstrating the potential anti-cancer effects of combining ME-344 with a VEGF inhibitor due to an inhibition of both mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism provided a basis for commencement of an investigator-initiated trial of ME-344 in combination with bevacizumab in HER2 negative breast cancer patients.
 Results published in the November 2019 issue of Clinical Cancer Research from a multicenter, investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label, clinical trial that evaluated the combination of ME-344 and bevacizumab in 42 women with early HER2-negative breast cancer further support the combinatorial use of ME-344 with anti-angiogenic therapeutics.
 The primary objective of the trial was to show proof of ME-344 biologic activity as measured by Ki67 reductions in the presence of the nuclear protein Ki67 (expression of which is strongly associated with tumor cell proliferation and growth) from days 0 to 28 compared to the

control group who received bevacizumab alone. Secondary objectives included determining whether ME-344 biologic activity correlates with vascular normalization. The data demonstrate significant biologic activity in the ME-344 treatment group:
 •In ME-344 treated patients, mean absolute Ki67 decreases were 13.3 compared to an increase of 1.1 in the bevacizumab monotherapy group (P=0.01).
 •In ME-344 treated patients, mean relative Ki67 decreases were 23% compared to an increase of 186% in the bevacizumab monotherapy group (P < 0.01).
 •The mean relative Ki67 reduction in patients experiencing vascular normalization in the ME-344 treated patients was 33%, compared to an increase of 11.8% in normalized patients from the bevacizumab monotherapy group (P=0.09). Approximately one-third of patients in each arm had vascular normalization.
 Treatment was generally well tolerated; three grade 3 adverse events of high blood pressure were reported, two in the ME-344 arm and one in the bevacizumab monotherapy arm.
 Results from our earlier, first-in-human, single-agent Phase 1 clinical trial of ME-344 in patients with refractory solid tumors were published in the April 1, 2015 issue of Cancer. The results indicated that eight of 21 evaluable patients (38%) treated with ME-344 achieved stable disease or better, including five who experienced progression-free survival that was at least twice the duration of their last prior treatment before entry into the trial. In addition, one of these patients, a heavily pre-treated patient with small cell lung cancer, achieved a confirmed partial response and remained on study for two years. ME-344 was generally well tolerated at doses equal to or less than 10 mg/kg delivered on a weekly schedule for extended durations. Treatment-related adverse events included nausea, dizziness and fatigue. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed at both the 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose levels, consisting primarily of grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. We are planning to advance ME-344 in combination with the anti-angiogenic antibody bevacizumab in a Phase 2 study evaluating patients with relapsed colorectal cancer.
Pracinostat: HDAC Inhibitor Candidate in a Phase 2 Clinical Trial
 Pracinostat is an oral HDAC inhibitor being evaluated in a Phase 2 trial in patients with high or very high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”) who are previously untreated with hypomethylating agents (the “POC study”). All patients in the study have completed therapy, the study has closed, and analyses are ongoing in preparation of a final study report.
In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license, development, manufacturing and commercialization agreement with Helsinn Healthcare SA, a Swiss pharmaceutical corporation (“Helsinn”) for pracinostat (the “Helsinn License Agreement”) as a treatment for patients with MDS or AML. Under the agreement, Helsinn is primarily responsible for funding global development and commercialization costs for pracinostat. We are responsible for conducting the POC study, the cost of which was shared equally with Helsinn. Any future development and commercialization costs after the completion of the POC study will be the responsibility of Helsinn.
 A Phase 3 study evaluating pracinostat in combination with azacitidine in patients with AML who are unfit to receive standard intensive chemotherapy was discontinued by Helsinn, the study sponsor, in July 2020 after an interim futility analysis undertaken by the study Independent Data Monitoring Committee demonstrated it was unlikely to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival compared to the control group. In connection with the discontinuation of the Phase 3 study, the FDA has withdrawn the breakthrough therapy designation previously granted for pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients with AML. Following the discontinuation of the Phase 3 AML study, Helsinn communicated to us their plan to continue therapy and observation of the patients currently in the Phase 2 MDS study and that further development of pracinostat, including for the treatment of MDS, is under review. The POC study of pracinostat for the treatment of MDS described under “Clinical Program” below was completed in December 2020. There are currently no plans to commence any additional studies for pracinostat.
 Pracinostat Scientific Overview; Epigenetics
 HDACs play a key role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression by regulating chromatin structure. Acetylation of positively charged lysine residues present in histone proteins by the histone acetyltransferase (“HATs”) reduces the affinity between histones and negatively charged DNA, resulting in the opening of the chromatin structure. This makes it easier for the transcriptional machinery to access the DNA, enhancing RNA transcription. Conversely, deacetylation by the HDACs closes the chromatin structure leading to a repression of gene transcription. In normal cells, HDACs and HATs together control histone acetylation levels to maintain a balance. In diseases such as cancer, this regulation can be disturbed. HDAC inhibitors cause accumulation of acetylated histones, enhance transcription and result in changes to a variety of cellular responses including differentiation, proliferation, migration, survival and response to metabolic and hypoxic stress. In general, tumor cells are more susceptible than normal cells to the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of HDAC inhibitors.
Clinical Program
 Pracinostat is being investigated in the POC study, which is a Phase 2 dose optimization trial evaluating patients with high and very high-risk MDS who are previously untreated with hypomethylating agents. All patients in the study have completed therapy and analyses are ongoing in preparation of a final study report. This patient group represents the highest unmet need in MDS, with median survival estimates of 1.6 years and 0.8 years, respectively (Greenberg et al, Blood 2012). The POC Study is an open-label trial evaluating a 45 mg dose of pracinostat in combination with the standard dose of azacitidine. The trial is designed to evaluate tolerability of the combination, with the intent of maintaining patient enrollment longer than in an earlier Phase 2 trial evaluating a 60 mg dose. A prolonged treatment may result in a systemic exposure to pracinostat and azacitidine sufficient to achieve the desired treatment effect; data from the earlier Phase 2 trial suggested that insufficient exposure to treatment may have limited the treatment effect of the combination.
 A pre-planned interim analysis of the POC study demonstrated a 10% discontinuation rate among the first 20 evaluable patients treated, meeting the predefined threshold in the first 3 treatment cycles. The 10% rate is consistent with the discontinuation rate for azacitidine given as a monotherapy in earlier studies with pracinostat. Having met this threshold, the trial expanded open-label enrollment to a total of 60 patients in the study. An interim analysis presented at the 2018 American Society of Hematology annual meeting demonstrated a discontinuation rate due to adverse events in the first three cycles of 4%, substantially lower than the rate of 26% reported in our prior Phase 2 trial.
The POC study completed enrollment and patients are being followed for at least two years to evaluate safety and efficacy. The primary endpoints of the trial are 1) safety and tolerability and 2) overall response rate, defined as complete remission (“CR”), partial remission (“PR”) and marrow CR. Secondary endpoints include CR rate, overall hematologic improvement (“HI”) response rate, clinical benefit rate (defined as rate of CR + PR + HI + Marrow CR), rate of cytogenetic complete response/remission, duration of response, rate of leukemic transformation, event-free survival, progression-free survival and overall survival.
Data from the POC study (n=64) presented as part of the ASCO 2020 Virtual Scientific Program in June 2020 demonstrated an estimated median overall survival (“OS”) rate of 23.5 months with a one-year OS rate of 77%. The median follow-up was 17.6 months (range, 15.7–18.8) and the overall response rate (“ORR”) was 33% (21/64), all of which are complete responses (“CR”). The clinical benefit rate (CR, mCR plus hematologic improvement (“HI”), mCR with no HI, or HI with no mCR) was 77% (49/64). Twenty-seven percent of patients (17/64) proceeded to a stem cell transplant while on study. Eleven percent of patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. The most common grade ≥3 treatment emergent adverse events were hematologic, and included decreased neutrophil count (50%), anemia (39%), febrile neutropenia (34%), decreased platelet count (33%), thrombocytopenia (27%), and decreased white blood cell count (20%). The POC study results have reached maturity leading to closing the study; as of the end of December 2020 no patients are being treated or followed in the study.
Competition
 The marketplace for our drug candidates is highly competitive. A number of other companies have products or drug candidates in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development that are intended for the same therapeutic indications for which our drug candidates are being developed. Some of these potential competing drug candidates are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized sooner. Even if we are successful in developing products that receive regulatory approval, such products may not compete successfully with products produced by our competitors or with products that may subsequently receive regulatory approval.
 Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors developing oncology drugs have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization than we do. They compete with us in recruiting sites and eligible patients to participate in clinical studies and in attracting development and/or commercialization partners. They also license technologies that are competitive with our technologies. As a result, our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and products that would render our technologies or our drug candidates obsolete or non-competitive.
 Intellectual Property
 We own, by assignment or exclusive license, worldwide rights to each of our current drug candidates. Our intellectual property portfolio includes approximately 40 issued U.S. patents, 330 issued foreign patents, 20 pending U.S. patent applications, and 165 pending foreign applications.
We have acquired, by assignment, worldwide rights to zandelisib and other related compounds from Pathway Therapeutics, Inc. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) has issued five patents covering zandelisib as composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of use to treat cancer. The issued U.S. patents with composition of matter claims covering zandelisib are projected to expire in January 2031 and December 2032, not including any patent term extension. There are approximately 47 foreign patents granted or

allowed. There are eight pending U.S. patent applications, one pending international patent application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT application), and approximately 96 pending foreign patent applications directed to zandelisib and related compounds.
 We have acquired exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize voruciclib from Presage Biosciences, Inc. (“Presage”). The USPTO has issued three patents covering the composition of matter and pharmaceutical compositions of voruciclib which are projected to expire between April 2024 and September 2028, not including any patent term extension. In total there are currently 17 allowed or issued U.S. patents, 81 allowed or issued foreign patents, five pending U.S. patent applications, and 23 pending foreign patent applications for voruciclib, related compounds, and related methods of use.
 We have acquired, by assignment, patents and patent applications from Novogen, our former majority shareholder, relating to a family of isoflavonoid compounds, including ME-344. The USPTO has issued 11 patents covering ME-344 as composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of use to treat cancer. There are approximately 70 foreign patents granted or allowed. The issued U.S. patents with composition of matter claims covering ME-344 are expected to expire in March 2027 and November 2031, not including patent term extension. There are three pending U.S. patent applications, one pending PCT application, and three pending foreign patent applications directed to ME-344 and related compounds.
We have acquired, by assignment, patents and patent applications from S*Bio Pte Ltd (“S*Bio”) relating to a family of heterocyclic compounds, including pracinostat. The USPTO has issued nine patents covering pracinostat as composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of use to treat proliferative diseases. There are approximately 132 foreign granted or allowed patents. The issued U.S. patents with composition of matter claims covering pracinostat are projected to expire in May 2028, not including patent term extension. In the Helsinn License Agreement, we granted to Helsinn an exclusive (subject to certain retained rights to perform obligations under the agreement), sublicensable, payment-bearing, license under and to certain patents and know-how controlled by us to develop, manufacture and commercialize pracinostat and any pharmaceutical product containing pracinostat for all human and animal indications. There are four pending U.S. patent applications and approximately 43 pending foreign patent applications directed to pracinostat and related compounds.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies, compounds and information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection for our key inventions, including drug candidates we identify, routes for chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical formulations. There is no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue, or that any of our patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant product or method. In addition, we regularly review our patent portfolio to identify patents and patent applications that we deem to have relatively low value to our ongoing business operations for potential abandonment. There is also no assurance that we will correctly identify which of our patents and patent applications should be maintained and which should be abandoned. The term of most of our other current patents commenced, and most of our future patents, if any, will commence, on the date of issuance and terminate 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. Because any marketing and regulatory approval for a drug often occurs several years after the related patent application is filed, the resulting market exclusivity afforded by any patent on our drug candidates and technologies will likely be substantially less than 20 years.
 As most patent applications in the U.S. are maintained as confidential until published by the USPTO at 18 months from filing for all cases filed after November 29, 2000, or at issue, for cases filed prior to November 29, 2000, we cannot be certain that we or Presage were the first to make the inventions covered by the patents and applications referred to above. Additionally, publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind the actual discoveries. Moreover, pursuant to the terms of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, patents filed on or after June 8, 1995 have a term of twenty years from the date of such filing except for provisional applications, irrespective of the period of time it may take for such patent to ultimately issue. This may shorten the period of patent protection afforded to therapeutic uses of zandelisib, voruciclib, ME-344 or pracinostat as patent applications in the biopharmaceutical sector often take considerable time to issue. However, in some countries the patent term may be extended.
 In order to protect the confidentiality of our technology, including trade secrets and know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, we require all of our consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into agreements that prohibit the use or disclosure of information that is deemed confidential. These agreements also oblige our consultants, advisors and collaborators to assign to us, or negotiate a license to developments, discoveries and inventions made by such persons in connection with their work relating to our products. We cannot be sure that confidentiality will be maintained by those from whom we have acquired technology or disclosure prevented by these agreements. We also cannot be sure that our proprietary information or intellectual property will be protected by these agreements or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or intellectual property.
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and patents may have been applied for by, and issued to, other parties relating to products competitive with zandelisib, voruciclib, ME-344 or pracinostat. Use of these compounds and any other drug candidates may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties, existing now and in the future. An adverse claim could subject us to significant liabilities to such other parties and/or require disputed rights to be licensed from such other parties. We cannot be sure that any

license required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we may encounter delays in product market introductions, or may find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses may be precluded.
 Research and Development
 The objective of our research and development program is the generation of data sufficient to achieve regulatory approval of our drug candidates in one or more dosage forms in major markets such as the U.S., to meet medical needs and develop a clinical and commercial profile with attractive attributes, and/or to allow us to enter into a development and/or commercial relationship with another party. The data are generated by our pre-clinical studies and clinical trial programs.
 The key aspects of our research and development program are to provide more complete characterization of the following:
 •the relevant molecular targets of action of our drug candidates;
 •the relative therapeutic benefits and indications for use of our drug candidates as a monotherapy or as part of combinational therapy with other agents; and
 •the most appropriate therapeutic indications and dosage forms for zandelisib, voruciclib, ME-344 and pracinostat.
 Government Regulation
 U.S. Regulatory Requirements
 The FDA, and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries, regulate and impose substantial requirements upon the research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, labeling, manufacture, quality control, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, import, and export of pharmaceutical products including biologics, as well as significant reporting and record-keeping obligations. State governments may also impose obligations in these and other areas.
 In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and other laws, including in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. We believe, but cannot be certain, that our products will be regulated as drugs by the FDA. The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 •pre-clinical laboratory evaluations, including formulation and stability testing, and animal tests performed under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") regulations to assess pharmacological activity and toxicity potential;
 •submission and approval of an IND application, including results of pre-clinical tests, manufacturing information, and protocols for clinical tests, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin in the U.S.;
 •obtaining approval of IRBs to administer the products to human subjects in clinical trials;
 •adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for the product’s intended use;
 •development of manufacturing processes which conform to FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), as confirmed by FDA inspection;
 •submission of results for pre-clinical, toxicology, and clinical studies, and chemistry, manufacture and control information on the product to the FDA in an NDA; and
 •FDA review and approval of an NDA, prior to any commercial sale or shipment of a product.
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 The results of the pre-clinical studies, together with initial specified manufacturing information, the proposed clinical trial protocol, and information about the participating investigators are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may begin human clinical trials in the U.S. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with federal regulations and Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements, and with investigational products that follow cGMP. GCPs include, among other requirements, the requirements related to monitoring, drug accountability, data integrity, and that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Additionally, an independent IRB must review and approve each study protocol and oversee conduct of the trial. An IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, the IND sponsor must resolve the FDA’s concerns before clinical trials can begin. Pre-clinical tests and studies can take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND we submit based on such tests and studies will become effective within any specific time period, if at all.
 Sponsors must make certain reports and submissions to FDA and global health authorities, as appropriate, and to clinical investigators who, in turn, make certain reports and submissions to the IRB or ethics committee, including annual reports, and reports of investigator financial interests, serious adverse events and other significant safety information, study amendments, and new study protocols. Information

about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must also be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on the clinicaltrials.gov website. Sponsors of investigational products for serious diseases must also have a publicly available policy on requests for expanded access.
 Investigational drugs and active ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA. Further, the export of investigational products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
 •Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety and dosage tolerance. Absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion testing is generally performed at this stage.
 •Phase 2: The drug is studied in controlled, exploratory therapeutic trials in a limited number of subjects with the disease or medical condition for which the new drug is intended to be used in order to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the preliminary or potential efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or medical conditions, and to determine dosage tolerance and the optimal effective dose.
 •Phase 3: When Phase 2 studies demonstrate that a specific dosage range of the drug may be effective and the drug has an acceptable safety profile for further investigation, controlled, large-scale therapeutic Phase 3 trials are undertaken at multiple study sites to demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population. Typically, two Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for product approval. Under some limited circumstances, however, the FDA may approve an NDA based upon a single Phase 3 clinical study plus confirmatory evidence or a single large multicenter trial without confirmatory evidence.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional non-clinical and toxicology studies and must also develop additional information about the CMC of the product candidate.
 Some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data monitoring committee. This group reviews data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of the trial. This group may also review interim data to assess the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. The data monitoring committee may advise the sponsor to halt the clinical trial, modify the clinical trial, or continue the clinical trial depending on safety results and the trial’s likelihood of success.
 We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete clinical testing of our products within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRB or we may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable safety risk or noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
 Results of pre-clinical and toxicology studies, and clinical trials, as well as detailed information about the manufacturing process, quality control methods, and product composition, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA seeking approval to market and commercially distribute the product on the basis of a determination that the product is safe and effective for its intended use. Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review, before it accepts the application for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the goals agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, (“PDUFA”), the agency currently aims to review 90% of all applications for new molecular entities within ten months of the 60-day filing date for a standard review. The PDUFA date is only a goal, thus, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the sponsor provides substantial additional information regarding the submission.
 The FDA may refer certain applications to an advisory committee, which is a panel of experts that make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and may inspect the sponsor, clinical study vendors, and clinical sites at which the product candidate was studied and will not approve the product unless cGMP and GCP compliance are satisfactory. If applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, the FDA may issue a complete response letter (“CRL”) to the sponsor requiring additional non-clinical or clinical studies or data or additional CMC information. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either: resubmit the marketing application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing.


Once the FDA determines that the approval requirements are met, it will issue an approval letter that authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of approval, the FDA also may require post-marketing commitments and requirements, including studies, and/or surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. The FDA also may require a Medication Guide and also a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("REMS"), or other conditions for a product's approval or following approval to ensure that the benefits of the product candidate outweigh the risks. Moreover, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications or populations for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a black box warning, impose other conditions, such as post-approval studies, or may not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing.
 Even after an NDA is approved, the FDA may impose additional obligations or restrictions (such as labeling changes, or clinical post-marketing requirements), or even suspend or withdraw a product approval or require additional testing or label revisions on the basis of data that arise after the product reaches the market, or if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained. We cannot be certain that any NDA we submit will be approved by the FDA for full or accelerated approval on a timely basis, if at all. Also, any such approval may limit the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. Any refusal to approve, delay in approval, suspension or withdrawal of approval, or restrictions on indicated uses could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects.
 Each NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee pursuant to the requirements of the PDUFA and its amendments. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances. Following product approval, drug products are also subject to annual program fees. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. A written request can be submitted for a waiver for the application fee for the first human drug application that is filed by a small business, but there are no small business waivers for program fees. Product candidates that are designated as orphan products are not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication and may be exempt from program fees if certain criteria are met. We are not at the stage of development with our products where we are subject to these fees, but they are significant expenditures that may be incurred in the future and must be paid at the time of application submissions to the FDA.
 Satisfaction of FDA requirements typically takes many years. The actual time required varies substantially, based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the pharmaceutical product, among other things. Government regulation imposes costly and time-consuming requirements and restrictions throughout the product life cycle and may delay product marketing for a considerable period of time, limit product marketing, or prevent marketing altogether. Success in pre-clinical or early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent marketing approval. Even if a product receives marketing approval, the approval is limited to specific clinical indications. Further, even after marketing approval is obtained, the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
 After product approval, there are continuing significant regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements, obligations to report adverse side effects in patients using the products, and restrictions on advertising and promotional activities. Quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs, and the FDA periodically inspects facilities to assess cGMP compliance. Additionally, post-approval changes in ingredient composition, manufacturing processes or facilities, product labeling, or other areas may require submission of an NDA Supplement to the FDA for review and approval. New indications will require additional clinical studies and submission of an NDA Supplement.
 Failure to comply with the FDA's regulatory requirements may result in an enforcement action by the FDA, including clinical holds, refusal to approve marketing applications or supplements, Warning Letters, product recalls, suspension or revocation of product approval, seizure of product to prevent distribution, impositions of injunctions prohibiting product manufacture or distribution, and civil and criminal penalties, among other actions. Maintaining compliance is costly and time-consuming. We cannot be certain that we, or our present or future suppliers or third-party manufacturers, will be able to comply with all FDA regulatory requirements, and potential consequences of noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects.
 The FDA’s policies may change, and additional governmental regulations may be enacted that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval of our products or affect our ability to manufacture, market, or distribute our products after approval. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of healthcare costs in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to commercialize future products will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other third-party payers. European Union member states and U.S. government and other third-party payers increasingly are attempting to contain healthcare costs by consideration of new laws and regulations limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs. Our failure to obtain coverage, an adequate level of reimbursement, or acceptable prices for our future products could diminish any revenues we may be able to generate. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.


Our activities also may be subject to state laws and regulations that affect our ability to develop and sell our products. We are also subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, clinical, laboratory, and manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future, and the failure to comply may have a material adverse impact on our business prospects.
 The FDCA includes provisions designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs and biological products intended for treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such conditions or present a significant improvement over existing therapy. These provisions set forth a procedure for designation of a drug as a “fast track product”. The fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and specific indication for which it is being studied. A product designated as fast track is ordinarily eligible for additional programs for expediting development and review, such as increased FDA interactions and rolling submission of the application.
 Products that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may also be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug approval under the accelerated approval regulations may be based on evidence of clinical effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. A post-marketing clinical study will be required to verify clinical benefit, and other restrictions to assure safe use may be imposed. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug or biologic from the market on an expedited basis.
 A third potential designation that may be available is breakthrough therapy designation. A breakthrough therapy is a product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Products designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for intensive FDA guidance, a commitment from the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative and cross-disciplinary review, rolling submission of the application, and the facilitation of cross-disciplinary review.
 Finally, if a product is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of the condition, the product may be eligible for priority review meaning that FDA’s goal for the review of an NDA is shortened to six months (after a two month period during which the FDA decides whether the application is ready for filing) rather than the standard review of ten months from application acceptance. Currently, we have fast track designation for one of our clinical programs (zandelisib for patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma who have received at least two prior systemic therapies). If we should seek additional designations for any of our programs, we cannot be assured that it will be granted by the FDA. There is also no guarantee that we will be able to maintain any designation that we have received or may receive.
 Following the FDA's approval of an NDA, sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug. These patents are published in the FDA’s list of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can be cited by potential competitors as a reference listed drug in support of a 505(b)(2) NDA or an Abbreviated New Drug Application, (“ANDA”). In an effort to clarify which patents must be listed in the Orange Book, in January 2021, Congress passed the Orange Book Transparency Act of 2020, which largely codifies FDA's existing practices into the FDCA.
 A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use as a previously approved product. ANDA applicants generally must only scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
 Generally, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA unless the reference listed drug’s Orange Book listed patents have expired and/or if the applicant certifies that it is not seeking approval for a patented method of use. FDA may approve these applications, however, if the 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA sponsor certifies that the Orange Book listed patents for the reference listed drug are invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This later certification is called a paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has made a paragraph IV certification, following notice to the NDA and patent holders, the NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit. If a lawsuit is brought, the FDA may not make an approval effective until the earlier of 30 months from the patent or application owner’s receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent is favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court.


Recently, Congress and U.S. federal administrative agencies have taken certain measures to increase drug competition and thus decrease drug prices, including by facilitating 505(b)(2) NDAs and ANDAs, and by introducing additional products into the U.S. market. By example, the FDA finalized a rule and a guidance to facilitate drug importation. Congress also passed a bill requiring sponsors of NDA products to provide sufficient quantities of drug product on commercially reasonable market-based terms to entities developing generic and 505(b)(2) products. This bill also included provisions on shared and individual REMS for generic drug products.
 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, a sponsor may obtain marketing exclusivity for a specified period of time following FDA approval of certain drug applications. By example, new drugs containing new chemical entities that have not been previously approved by the FDA may obtain five years of exclusivity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a paragraph IV certification. This exclusivity is not absolute. For instance, it will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; though, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
 Following NDA approval, a patent owner may obtain an extension of a single unexpired patent that has not previously been extended for a period equal to one-half the period of time elapsed between the filing of an IND and the filing of the corresponding NDA plus the period of time between the filing of the NDA and FDA approval, with a five year maximum patent extension. The total patent life of the product with the extension cannot exceed fourteen years from the product’s approval date. The period of patent extension may also be reduced for any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence. We cannot be certain that we will be able to take advantage of either the patent term extension or marketing exclusivity provisions of these laws or that, if received, they will adequately protect any approved products from competition.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”), signed into law on January 4, 2002, was reauthorized and amended by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (“FDAAA”). The reauthorization of BPCA adds an additional six months of marketing exclusivity and patent protection to unexpired exclusivities and unexpired patents listed with the FDA for NDA applicants that conduct acceptable pediatric studies of new and currently marketed drug products for which pediatric information would be beneficial, as identified by the FDA in a Pediatric Written Request. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly address the agreement between the sponsor and the FDA in the Pediatric Written Request, the additional protection is granted.
 The Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), signed into law on December 3, 2003, also was reauthorized and amended by the FDAAA. The reauthorization of PREA requires that most applications for drugs and biologics include a pediatric assessment (unless waived or deferred) to ensure the drugs’ and biologics’ safety and effectiveness in children. Such pediatric assessment must contain data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the assessment is required, that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or the biological product is safe and effective. The pediatric assessments can only be deferred provided there is a timeline for the completion of such studies. The FDA may waive (partially or fully) the pediatric assessment requirement for several reasons, including if the applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed. Orphan products are also exempt from the PREA requirements. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act signed into law on July 9, 2012, permanently renewed and strengthened BPCA and PREA.
 Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, sponsors submitting original applications on or after August 18, 2020, for product candidates intended for the treatment of adult cancer which are directed at molecular targets that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of pediatric cancer must submit, prior to marketing application submission, submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan ("iPSP") for FDA agreement, and with the application, reports from molecularly targeted pediatric cancer clinical investigations designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data, using appropriate pediatric formulations, to inform potential pediatric labeling. While orphan products are not exempt from this requirement, the FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data.
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan drug designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the already approved product and is intended for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan drug designation does, however, entitle a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and certain user-fee waivers. The tax advantages, however, were limited in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances. If there is already a product approved by FDA that is the same product for the same indication, the orphan designated product will only receive orphan drug exclusivity if the prior hypothesis of clinical superiority is demonstrated.


Foreign Regulatory Requirements
 Outside the U.S., our ability to market our products will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities and compliance with applicable post-approval regulatory requirements. Although the specific requirements and restrictions vary from country to country, as a general matter, foreign regulatory systems include risks similar to those associated with FDA's regulations, described above.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or a decentralized procedure (“DCP”). Under the centralized procedure, a single application to the EMA leads to an approval granted by the European Commission which permits the marketing of the product throughout the EU. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain classes of medicinal products such as new substances for the treatment of oncology. In addition, all medicinal products developed by certain biotechnological means, and those developed for cancer and other specified diseases and disorders, must be authorized via the centralized procedure. The centralized procedure will apply to any of our products that are developed by means of a biotechnology process or are intended for treatment of cancer. The DCP is used for products that are not eligible or required to be authorized by the centralized procedure. The centralized procedure is optional for certain other products. Since the exit of the UK from the European Union, the UK has been excluded from the centralized procedure. It will be necessary for applicants to make a separate application to the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA") for a UK marketing authorization. There is currently no procedure for mutual EU/UK recognition of new medicinal products.
 As with FDA approval, we may not be able to secure regulatory approvals in the EU in a timely manner, if at all. Additionally, as in the U.S., post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution, would apply to any product that is approved in the EU, and failure to comply with such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize any product.
 The conduct of clinical trials in the European Union is governed by the European Clinical Trials Directive ("CTD"), which was implemented in May 2004. This Directive governs how regulatory bodies in member states control clinical trials. No clinical trial may be started without a clinical trial authorization granted by the national competent authority and favorable ethics approval. New legislation to revise and replace the European Clinical Trials Directive (the Clinical Trials Regulation/"CTR") has been passed but is not yet implemented (currently estimated for 31 January 2022). With the exit of the UK from the European Union, the UK will not be implementing the CTR and the UK provisions implementing the current law as set out in the CTD will continue to apply until amended by the UK.
Accordingly, there is a marked degree of change and uncertainty both in the regulation of clinical trials and in respect of marketing authorizations which we face for our products in the EU.
 Manufacturing
 We do not have the facilities or capabilities to commercially manufacture any of our drug candidates. We are and expect to continue to be dependent on contract manufacturers for supplying our existing and future candidates for clinical trials and commercial scale manufacturing of our candidates in accordance with regulatory requirements, including cGMP. Contract manufacturers may utilize their own technology, technology developed by us, or technology acquired or licensed from third parties. FDA approval of the manufacturing procedures and the site will be required prior to commercial distribution.
Human Capital Management
 As of June 30, 2021, we had 76 employees, 18 of whom hold a Ph.D. or M.D. degree. Other personnel resources are used from time to time as consultants or third-party service organizations on an as-needed basis. All members of our senior management team have prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced personnel, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the individuals needed.
Our people are a critical component in our continued success. We strive to create a workplace of choice to attract, retain and develop top talent to achieve our strategic goals. We strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables our employees to further our mission. We adhere to a philosophy that includes, among other things, commitments to create ongoing job opportunities, pay fair wages, and protect worker health and safety.
 We invest in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and benefits. We endeavor to foster a strong sense of ownership by offering stock options under our equity incentive plan. We also offer comprehensive and locally relevant benefits for all eligible employees.
 We focus on our culture through a combination of regular training for employees at all levels, policies and practices in support of these goals, and a variety of internal and community-based events and actions that reinforce the power of our values and the unique characteristics of each of our employees.
 We have implemented COVID-19 policies designed to ensure the safety and well-being of all employees and the people associated with them. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce risk, our employees have been asked to work remotely, and all employees have been asked to avoid all non-essential travel, adhere to good hygiene practices, and engage in physical distancing.


None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage and believe our relationship with our employees is good. Management considers its relations with employees to generally be positive.
