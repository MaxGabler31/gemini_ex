ITEM 1.                BUSINESS.
 
General Development
 
Rego Payment Architectures, Inc. (the “Company,” “we”, or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware on February 11, 2008 under the name Chimera International Group, Inc.  On April 4, 2008, we amended our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to Moggle, Inc.  On August 22, 2011, we filed a Certificate of Ownership with the Secretary of State of Delaware, pursuant to which the Company’s newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Virtual Piggy Incorporated was merged into and with the Company (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger and in accordance with Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the name of the Company was changed from “Moggle, Inc.” to “Virtual Piggy, Inc.”  On February 28, 2017, we amended our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to Rego Payment Architectures, Inc. Our principal offices are located at 18327 Gridley Road, Suite K Cerritos, CA 90703 and our telephone number is (561) 220-0408.
 
As of the date of this report, we have not generated significant revenues.  Our initial business plan was to develop an online game platform to allow game companies to create, monetize and distribute massive multiplayer online games (MMOG). The Company technology was the monetization component of this overall platform (our “Platform”). During 2010, we analyzed the market potential for an expanded Company solution and decided to concentrate our efforts on the delivery of a full-featured Company solution that was not restricted to online gaming. The expanded Company solution is designed to provide a complete online solution for families and parents to teach their children about financial management and spending on gaming, retail, music and entertainment. In late 2013, we rebranded our Company product under the name “Oink®”.  In March 2016, we discontinued our prior Oink product offering.

In April 2016, our former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) resigned and we hired a new CEO who was concentrating on the FinTech industry.  In September 2017, this CEO resigned and we hired a new CEO, whose focus is monetizing the Platform in the FinTech industry and crypto currencies, through technology licensing and similar partnerships.  We are focused on building and improving the existing Platform that will act as the foundation for the strategic alignment with the Financial Technology (“FinTech”) industry.  The FinTech industry is composed primarily of startup companies that use software to provide financial services more efficiently and less costly than traditional financial service companies.  With our COPPA compliant technology as an added feature, we believe we will have better market success.
 
Overview
 
We are a technology company that will deliver an online and mobile payment platform solution for the family. Our system allows parents and their children to manage, allocate funds and track their expenditures, savings and charitable giving on both a mobile device and online through our web portal.   Our system is designed to allow a minor to transact both online and in traditional brick and mortar retail outlets using the telephone handset as a payment device.  The new payment platform automatically monitors regulatory compliance in real-time for all transactions; including protection of vendors from unintended regulatory infractions.  In addition utilizing the same architecture we allow individual parents to create a contract with each child that sets the rules and parameters of how the child may use the mobile payment system with as much or as little parental oversight as the parent determines is necessary.  In addition, we are including specialized technology that increases and improves the security of the system and protects the user’s identity while in use.
 
COPPA applies not only to websites and mobile apps.  It can apply to a growing list of connected devices that is included in the Internet of Things.  Some of these include toys and products that could collect personal information, such as voice recordings or geolocation information.
 
Management believes that building on its COPPA advantage that the future of Rego Payment Architectures, Inc. will be based on the foundational architecture of the system that will allow its use across multiple financial markets where secure controlled payments are needed.  For the under seventeen years of age market, the company will use its OINK. Com brand.  The Company will license in each alternative field of use the ability for its partners, distributors and/ or value added resellers to private label each of the alternative markets.  These partners will deploy, customize and support each implementation under their own label, but with acknowledgement of the Company’s proprietary intellectual assets as the base technology.  Management believes this approach will enable the Company to reduce expenses while broadening its reach.
 
Revenues generated from this system will come from multiple sources depending on the level of service and facilities requested by the parent.  There will be levels of subscription revenue paid monthly, service fees, transaction fees and in some cases revenue sharing with banking and distribution partners.
 
In addition, the team is analyzing specific components of our technology for individual monetization as well as exploring opportunities in the Business to Business (“B2B”) realm. The new architecture lends itself to provide closed network capability that allow B2B transactions outside of the traditional payment processing interchange services.  This reduces the cost of transacting between businesses.  Businesses that join the B2B will be able to perform instant settlements of transactions at lower fees than traditional services.
 
Industry Background
 
There are over 2 billion teens globally in the world and over 26 million teens in our Total Addressable Market (TAM) here in the US alone, most without digital payment capability or traditional card technology.   This is Generation Z: the Pivotal Generation (“Gen Z”), those born after the millennials (from 1997 and 2015) most of whom are currently under the age of 18 and are characterized by growing up in a highly sophisticated media and computer environment with greater internet savvy than any previous generation. Gen Z makes up 26% of the United States population. They use the mobile internet more than any other generation on a daily basis. Marketers have been focused on the millennials for more than a decade. Gen Z is a generation that influences all family purchases and has disposable income. On average Gen Z receive $17/week in allowance which gives them $44 billion spending power in the US per year.

Because there is no direct financial solution for this group, they still use either cash or their parent’s funding source (credit card) and hence there is still a lack of quantification of the dollar size of the kids “spending” market, which is separate from the dollars spent on kids. Marketers and regulators have taken note of the change and made a shift to a more “digital” approach to their overall strategy.  Additionally, kids’ access to increasingly available technology has fueled concerns about security, safety and compliance with government regulations. As children march toward adulthood, parents are providing the means for children to have products (money), and technology and providing them the increasingly easy opportunity to do so.
 
With Gen Z in mind, the Company is focusing on the FinTech industry.  Goldman Sachs has estimated that new FinTech companies could wrestle approximately $4.7 trillion in annual revenue and $470 billion in profit, away from established financial service companies.  Additionally, in 2014 and 2015, venture capitalists infused $23.5 billion into the FinTech industry.  Of that investment, approximately 27% was invested in consumer lending, 23% in payments and 16% in business lending.  The industry is priding itself on utilizing data in more productive ways and making the consumer interface smoother.
 
The FinTech companies are not restricted by regulatory compliance nor antiquated systems with which the established financial services companies contend.  These companies can concentrate on single purpose solutions, which are designed to enhance the user’s experience.  The innovations taking place can be summarized in four categories:
 
 
1. | Peer-to-Peer (“P2P”) value exchanges – Growth of applications has been stimulated by the popularity and use of social networks.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Applications with machine intelligence – Automation becoming a necessity in the do-it-yourself environment.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Data-driven services – The ability to access data and data analytics are leading to more individualized products and lower pricing of financial services.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Less definition between physical and virtual worlds – People are using financial services more in the virtual arena than in visiting physical locations.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



With this as a backdrop, Rego Payment Architectures, Inc. has identified an emerging need to market a financial platform that provides this generation with an alternative solution to traditional banking and solves current limitations on their ability to safely transact using mobile payment solutions for both brick & mortar retail outlets and online shopping.
 
The Company’s Relationship to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)
 
Though the Company does not target or collect the personal information of the under 13 age group, and rather targets parents and families as a whole, the products must still be compliant with COPPA. The new products will meet the requirements imposed by COPPA, including the recent amendments.  The Company has gone further than dealing with the federal rules by mapping all state by state statutes and regulations that deviate from the federal laws and thus having a complete inter-state commerce view of the regulations that assure compliance for all participants in the system.
Other Consumer Privacy Protection Legislation
 
In late 2010, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Department of Commerce (“DOC”) each issued a staff report proposing new frameworks for consumer privacy protection; the FTC report called for federal “Do Not Track” legislation. The FTC has also increased its enforcement actions against companies that fail to live up to their privacy or data security commitments to consumers. A number of privacy and data security bills have been introduced in Congress that address the collection, maintenance and use of personal information, web browsing and geolocation data, and establish data security and breach notification requirements. Some state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate on the Internet, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches. Several Congressional hearings have examined privacy implications for online, offline and mobile data. The DOC recently issued a “green paper” on cybersecurity, and the White House has proposed cybersecurity legislation.  Fundamental to the Company’s operating principles is to implement these regulatory conditions in its system and have the flexibility to adopt to any changes in legislation to meet federal and state compliance requirements.

A number of foreign governments also have either adopted or are considering data privacy and security regulations. For example, the EU is currently reviewing its data privacy directive, which became effective in 1998 and sets baseline standards for the collection, use, disclosure, storage, security and transfer of personal data (collectively referred to as “data processing”). Among the proposed revisions are new rules that strengthen requirements to obtain explicit consent for data processing; special rules requiring parental consent for collecting children’s personal data; data breach obligations for all industry sectors and enhanced remedies for violations of privacy. Different policy options, including new regulations, are being considered at both the EU and member state levels.  The company’s initial target is the U.S. However, the Company has been performing research on compliance issues in the EU and is able to rapidly adopt to these new markets should the Company choose to expand its services into those territories.
 
The Opportunity
 
Gen Z, the core target user of our OINK Mobile payment platform.
 
As consumers, Gen Z has deep pockets, but lacks direct access to funds.
 
Their spending power is significant and growing. According to the U.S. Census, Gen Z, will ultimately number close to 80 million.  In 2015, 9.7% of adults said that their children influence 100% of what they buy, which is up from 7.6% in 2014 and 93% of parents say their children influence family spending and household purchases.
 
In 2015, the average weekly allowance of a Gen Z is $17. This is based on an average of one dollar per week per year of age.  The company’s focus group returns predict an average of $25 per week. Gen Z has a combined buying power of $44 billion in the US, representing the Company’s Total Addressable Market.
 
Social and digital learning is key to Gen Z.
 
52% of Gen Z uses YouTube or social media to research school assignments, while 85% research online and 33% watch lessons online. Sharing their knowledge is of equal importance with 60% of the Gen Z population opting to share their own knowledge with others online.  When this generation makes purchases online 70% do so from a single online source.
 
Gen Z’s financial future and global impact has yet to be written.
 
While 60% of Gen Z say ‘a lot of money’ is a sign of success and 72% of Gen Z want to start a business one day, the details of how to make smart choices about money are not being shared. Only 17 states require a course in personal finance. Financial illiteracy is an epidemic and there’s no educational or private solution that has made an impact to scale. Gen Z is primed for deep engagement around future-focused payments solutions, but the conversation and learning and introduction of new financial technologies for this generation must occur within an experience that complements their values, interests and goals.  To this end, the financial literacy facilities built within the system target both the parent and the child.  These built in guidelines will prepare children for the financial responsibilities they will have in the future and prepare them for the emerging digital economy.

Our Solution
 
Our goal, moving forward is to enable both incumbent and new FinTech participants, as well as key verticals with a large base of ‘family accounts,’ to provide their consumers with safe and empowering youth money management and financial literacy content and tools via the OINK mobile payment platform.
 
Currently, our partner profile includes established brands with large family-focused account bases — including banks, telecommunication companies, faith-based organizations, media distributors, mobile device Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), and merchants.
 
OINK partners will leverage our platform to:
 
Buy vs. Build: Partners can license for their specific market or field of use a safe, compliant system, instead of building one on their own.
 
Safety & Security: Partners can safely engage a younger consumer segment and their families with a new family friendly peer to peer payments approach.  Vendors will be explicitly protected from non-compliant transactions and the underlying technology protects the privacy of the user.
Youth Financial Literacy: Partners can expand their brand story around empowerment and education of youth financial literacy while engaging their ‘future customers’ with Gen Z, a digital native population of post-millennial youth.
 
The OINK mobile payment platform and associated digital wallet technology is designed to enable our partners to engage families with Gen Z through the leading money management, transactional and financial literacy platform that enables young people to make smart decisions about the things they value in life — including their money, their time, their ideas and their connections.  The new platform will enable a new way for individual users to own and monetize their purchasing behavior that is currently unavailable to them.
 
In addition, we are analyzing specific components of our technology for individual monetization as well as exploring opportunities in the Business to Business (“B2B”) realm.
 
Other markets for potential licensed applications are:
 
Government social services payments where control over how benefits allowances are used is required.  This is particularly necessary in some European countries where social benefits are not being used as intended by the government or where benefits are subject to fraud.
 
Closed network consumer to business (C2B) and business to business (B2B).  An example is school lunch programs where the consumer can make direct mobile payments to the provider’s point of sale terminal (POS) without the need to traverse the traditional merchant payment system.  This reduces the cost per transaction for the vendor and provides instant non-repudiated settlement.  Many school lunch programs are now provided by large catering companies.  This is particularly valuable as credit card fees, transaction fees and service fees can exceed 3% in overhead costs per transaction dependent on the negotiated rate.  Removing this overhead can have significant positive financial impact on profitably.  It also allows the closed network to own its own behavioral use data thus obviating the need to pay a third party for the same data.

Our Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual property is important to our business. The Company has four issued patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), entitled “System and Method for Verifying the Age of an Internet User,” “System and Method for Virtual Piggy Bank Wish-List,” ”Parent Match”  and “System and Method for Virtual Piggy Bank.” The Company has filed for one provisional U.S. patent application, as well as twelve non-provisional U.S. patent applications, one of which is pending, four of which have been allowed, and seven of which have been abandoned. Additionally, the Company has been granted two patents, entitled “Virtual Piggy Bank” and “Parent Match,” in each of Germany, Canada, and Australia.  The Company also has patents pending in the Republic of Korea under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”).  Costs associated with the registration and legal defense of the patents have been capitalized and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives of the patents.
 
The following are the names and brief descriptions of certain of our applications:
 
Virtual Piggy Bank.   A method of providing control preferences for a prospective Internet user, the method comprising the steps of establishing a first account, the settings of the first account being stored in a database; establishing a second account, the settings of the second account being stored in the database; linking the first and second accounts such that control settings of the second account are determined through the first account; and making a purchase from the second account consistent with the control settings of the second account.
Parent Match.  A method of providing control preferences set by a person for a second person who is a prospective Internet user, the method comprising the steps of establishing a first account, the settings of the first account being stored in a database; establishing a second account, the settings of the second account being stored in the database; linking the first and second accounts such that control settings of the second account are determined through the first account; and viewing Internet content from the second account consistent with the control settings of the second account.
 
Verifying the Age of an Internet User.  A system and method of verifying the age of a prospective internet user, the method comprising creating an age check account with a service requester; activating the age check system through the account; inputting into the age check system a user’s information; checking user’s information by age check system; and notifying service requester of checked user’s information by the age check system.
 
System and Method for Virtual Piggybank Wishlist. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, storing one or more programs configured for execution, the one or more programs for monitoring, transmitting, and recording usage of a computer or mobile device connected to a network, the one or more programs including instructions for establishing a first account, the settings of the first account being stored in a database; establishing a second account, the settings of the second account being stored in the database, wherein the second account includes a wish-list; linking the first and second accounts such that control settings of the second account are determined through the first account; and  making a purchase from the wish-list of the second account consistent with the control settings of the second account.
 
Until such time as the remaining pending patents are awarded, if ever, we intend to rely on trade secret protection and/or confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, business partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights.  The Company entered into a licensing agreement for the underlying technology used to provide the contract models and real time regulatory oversight disclosed in prior filings. 
 
Furthermore, we have filed trademark applications pertaining to our service with the USPTO, the European Community, and Canada. The USPTO has already granted us service mark registrations for Oink, Oink (stylized), PiggyPick, Virtual Piggy, Virtual Piggy and design (horizontal), the PIG design, Parent Match, Quickconnect, Virtual Piggy Youth Empowered Parent Approved and Design, Youth Empowered. Parent Approved, and Oink.com. The European Community has already granted us registration for Virtual Piggy, Virtual Piggy and Design, Virtual Piggy Youth Empowered Parent Approved and Design, PiggyPick, Wishlist Wednesday, the PIG design, and the PIG design (alternative). The Canadian Intellectual Property Office has already granted the registration for VP Authenticate.

Despite certain precautions taken by us, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization. This risk may be increased due to the lack of patent and/or copyright protection.  If any of our proprietary rights are misappropriated or we are forced to defend our intellectual property rights, we will have to incur substantial costs. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, including diverting the time and effort of our senior management, and could disrupt our business, as well as have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Management will from time to time determine whether applying for and pursuing patent and copyright protection is appropriate for us.  We have no guarantee that any applications will be granted or, if awarded, whether they will offer us any meaningful protection from other companies in our business, or that we will have the financial resources to oppose any actual or threatened infringement by any third party.  Furthermore, any patent or copyrights that we may be granted may be held by a court to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and subject us to the payment of damage awards.
 
In addition, we cannot be certain that our technology will not infringe upon patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. While we know of no basis for any claims of this type, the existence of and ownership of intellectual property can be difficult to verify and we have not made an exhaustive search of all patent filings. We may become subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business. If we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be enjoined from using such intellectual property, and we may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternative technology or obtain other licenses. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses in defending against these third party infringement claims and be diverted from devoting time to our business and operational issues, regardless of the merits of any such claim. 
 
Research and Development
 
During 2017 and 2016, our research and product development expenses were $1.1 million and $830,000 all of which were borne by us.
 
Our Revenue Model    
 
Our ability to generate and grow revenue is affected by consumer spending patterns, merchant and consumer adoption of digital payment methods.  We are relying on the the growth of mobile devices and the applications that will be used by merchants and consumers on those devices, and the transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, including cryptocurrencies. Our strategy to drive revenue in our business includes the following:
 
 
· | Utilize our COPPA compliant platform to capitalize on mobile device applications
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | License our technology for use with compatible technologies focusing on digital forms of payment
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utilize the blockchain component of the platform in conjunction with cryptocurrencies
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



As of the date of this report, we have not generated significant revenue.  Our previous revenues were generated by taking a small percentage of every transaction from an online merchant. Until now this was our only revenue source. As we proceed through 2018, we expect to generate additional revenue streams by generating licensing fees from our co-branding partners.
 

We will seek to derive revenues from:
 

 
· | Private labeling licenses for: particular phones, telecommunication vendors, distributors, and value added resellers (VAR).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | User Subscription fees based on premium services.
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | Transaction and processing fees for both closed and open network transactions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 7
 


 
· | Special services fees for ad hoc special requests.
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | Data analytics sales – using algorithms to analyze use data for sale to data brokers (meta data).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Advertising revenue – for context based push messaging to subscribers
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Shared transaction revenue or rebates from banking partners
--+------------------------------------------------------------

Our Plan of Operation
 
A phased approach to the introduction of our improved Platform is planned. 
 
We plan to launch our branding platform in the second quarter of 2018, however, this is dependent on our ability to generate renewed capital investment for working capital and to sustain operations.  The Company will also enter into strategic partnerships where the strategic partner will provide development capital for special purpose customization or equity where appropriate.
Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
In 2018, we are focusing on onboarding established brands with large family-focused account bases that would enable us to co-brand our platform and reach the Gen Z population through the FinTech industry, telecommunications businesses and global consulting organizations. The Company maintains its view that these channels are most likely to provide rapid adoption of its technology across a broader industry segment.
Seasonality
 
Our new model should not be subject to seasonality.
 
Competition
 
There is a continuous introduction of new entrants into the market and the development of new technologies and product offerings in the global payments industry which is already highly competitive.  Although payment services such as PayPal, Amex Bluebird, FamZoo and Visa Buxx can be viewed as our competitors, we do not believe that these provide the type of family friendly solution that not only teaches young people about saving, spending, and giving, but that is also compliant with COPPA, and other laws that users of all ages need to be aware of, including but not limited to privacy, data collection, and security. Like them, however, we will compete against many companies that are larger than we are in a wide range of businesses, including banks, credit card providers, technology and ecommerce companies and traditional retailers.  These businesses offer other products and services that we do not offer and have been in the industry much longer than we have. We will compete against various forms of payment methods including cash and checks, credit and debit cards, automated clearing house, mobile payments and other online payment services.
 
We believe we have built and continue to build a financial solution that is not only good for the youth market, but one that will be requested by them over other products. To compete effectively, we expect that we will focus a majority of our 2018 resources on technology and product development.
 
Government Regulation
 
The industry which we serve is subject to regulation by the FTC, laws such as COPPA, and other laws relating to collection, use, retention, and security. Complying with these varying U.S. and international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. In addition, we have and post on our websites our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data.  Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect us. In addition, we are subject to the possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.

 The Company has put in preventative measures to reduce the risk of non-compliance and security breaches.  However, as the Company utilizes third party infrastructure, the risk of security breaches cannot be guaranteed but the Company has performed reasonable efforts to mitigate risk.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 11 employees, who were working in the areas of sales, marketing, programming and product development, web development, legal, finance and administration.  None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.   We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
