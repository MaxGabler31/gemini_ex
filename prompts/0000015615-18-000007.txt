ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

We are a leading infrastructure construction company operating mainly throughout North America across a range of industries. Our primary activities include the engineering, building, installation, maintenance and upgrade of communications, energy and utility infrastructure, such as: wireless, wireline/fiber, install-to-the-home and customer fulfillment activities; petroleum and natural gas pipeline infrastructure; electrical utility transmission and distribution; conventional and renewable power generation; heavy civil and industrial infrastructure. Our customers are primarily in these industries. Including our predecessor companies, we have been in business for almost 90 years. We offer our services primarily under the MasTec service mark and, as of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 17,300 employees and 400 locations. We have been consistently ranked among the top specialty contractors by Engineering News-Record for the past several years.
We provide our services to a diversified base of customers. We often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which are generally multi-year agreements. The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require the construction or installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an infrastructure system. Revenue from non-recurring, project specific work may experience greater variability than master service and other service agreement work due to the need to replace the revenue as projects are completed. If we are not able to replace work from completed projects with new project work, we may not be able to maintain our current revenue levels or our current level of capacity and resource utilization. We actively review our backlog of project work and take appropriate action to minimize such exposure. 
We seek to grow and diversify our business organically and through acquisitions and/or other strategic arrangements in order to deepen our market presence, broaden our geographic reach and expand our service offerings. For discussion of our recent acquisitions, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business,” which is incorporated by reference.
We manage our operations under five operating segments, which represent our five reportable segments: (1) Communications; (2) Oil and Gas; (3) Electrical Transmission; (4) Power Generation and Industrial and (5) Other. This structure is generally focused on broad end-user markets for our labor-based construction services.
The Communications segment performs engineering, construction, maintenance and customer fulfillment activities related to communications infrastructure, primarily for wireless and wireline/fiber communications and install-to-the-home customers, and, to a lesser extent, infrastructure for utilities, among others. We perform engineering, construction and maintenance services on oil and natural gas pipelines and processing facilities for the energy and utilities industries through our Oil and Gas segment. The Electrical Transmission segment primarily serves the energy and utility industries through the engineering, construction and maintenance of electrical transmission lines and substations. The Power Generation and Industrial segment primarily serves energy, utility and other end-markets through the installation and construction of conventional and renewable power facilities, related electrical transmission infrastructure, ethanol/biofuel facilities and various types of heavy civil and industrial infrastructure. The Other segment includes equity investees, the services of which vary from those provided by our four primary segments, as well as other small business units that perform construction and other services for a variety of international end-markets.

Industry Trends
Our industry is composed of national, regional and local companies that provide services to customers in a range of industries. We believe the following industry trends affect demand for our services: 
Industry Opportunities in our Communications Segment 
Significant advances in technology and rapid innovation in service offerings to data consumers have substantially increased demand for faster and more reliable wireless and wireline/fiber communications network services. In its 2017 Visual Networking Index: Forecast and Methodology, 2016-2021 report (the “2017 VNI report”), Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) predicts that global network traffic will increase nearly threefold over the next five years, with an expected compound annual growth rate of approximately 25%, and that broadband connection speeds will nearly double by 2021, 
5

from 27.5 Mbps to 53 Mbps. With the adoption of mobile devices and advancements in the “internet of things,” the amount of data affecting network traffic is at an all-time high and is expected to continue to substantially increase in the future. Increased mobile consumer and business usage of data, video and voice transmission, including from video and music download services, high definition television, mobile television streaming, home security, home automation and other advanced data services, including machine-to-machine connections such as video surveillance, smart meters and digital health monitors, have increased data traffic resulting in new and upgraded network requirements. One industry publication predicts that the demand for data capacity in ten years could be almost 1,000 times what it is today, and Cisco, in its 2017 VNI report, predicts that the number of devices connected to the network will exceed three times the global population by 2021. 
In response to this growing demand, multiple major carriers have continued expanding wireless network capacity and density with accelerated development and planned implementation of 5th generation (“5G”) wireless technologies. The increased speed and capacity that will result from deployment of 5G technology will require additional and improved tower capacity with higher data frequencies, as well as deployment of numerous higher bandwidth small cells to “densify” network performance. Small cell deployment and other initiatives, such as Verizon Communications Inc.’s recently announced launch of “One Fiber,” an infrastructure designed to improve wireless network performance, will also require carriers to expand and deploy fiber to support wireless network data capacity and speed. These factors are expected to create incremental opportunities for investment in communications infrastructure in addition to the continued expansion and deployment by telephone companies and cable operators of fiber-to-the-home with 1-Gigabit-per-second high-speed internet connectivity. In addition, in March 2017, AT&T was selected to build and run the First Responder Network Authority (“FirstNetTM”), a new wireless official public safety network for first responders throughout the United States that will be constructed over the next several years. AT&T has stated that it expects to spend approximately $40 billion over the next 25 years as it builds and manages the network, along with a potential $6.5 billion federal government sponsored investment by FirstNetTM over the next five years. 
One industry publication predicts that the United States will require an estimated $130 to $150 billion of fiber infrastructure investment over the next five to seven years to support the increases in projected mobile data traffic and related broadband infrastructure needs. Another industry publication anticipates that from $60 to $250 billion will be invested in 5G technologies over the next decade. 
In the install-to-the-home and customer fulfillment markets, we believe that growth opportunities will be driven from customers seeking to expand their service offerings in the areas of install-to-the-home, customer fulfillment, in-home security and automation and commercial energy management solutions.
We believe that we are well positioned as one of the largest providers of communications infrastructure services to significantly benefit from the significant and multiple infrastructure opportunities as previously described. Initial field testing and global standard development for 5G technology has recently been completed, with multiple major market deployments expected to begin in 2018, and we also believe that the buildout and deployment of the FirstNetTM network will also commence during 2018. These initiatives, along with the expected benefit to our customers of lower corporate income tax rates and the accelerated depreciation provisions of the 2017 Tax Act are expected to drive communications infrastructure investment for years to come.
Industry Opportunities in our Oil and Gas Segment
We believe that we are one of the leading pipeline contractors in North America, and have a balanced portfolio of service offerings, including the construction and maintenance of large diameter (“long-haul”) pipeline, midstream pipeline, gathering lines and related compressor and pumping stations and treatment plants, offering both union and non-union services. Demand for pipeline infrastructure and the related level of oil and natural gas pipeline construction activity in North America has grown significantly in recent years. Technological advances have significantly increased producible North American oil and natural gas reserves and changed the geographic sources of North American energy production. This has generated increased demand for pipeline infrastructure for the long-distance transportation of oil and gas production to refining centers, distribution hubs and industrial users throughout North America, most often through conversion from truck and rail transportation to lower cost and safer pipeline infrastructure. For example, in October 2017, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) reported over 2,700 miles of pending natural gas pipeline projects, each with a project length in excess of 100 miles. We anticipate that demand for pipeline infrastructure in North America will provide significant opportunities for years to come, and that our diverse capabilities and expertise will enable us to continue to be a leading service provider in this market.
According to the Department of Energy’s (“DOE”) January 2018 Short-Term Energy Outlook, the U.S. became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017, driven by increased levels of low-cost natural gas production, coupled with rising demand. In addition, natural gas continued to surpass coal in 2017 as the leading fuel type for electric power generation. In its 2018 Annual Energy Outlook, the DOE predicted that the U.S. will become a net exporter of energy, including exports of both oil and natural gas, by the early 2020s. According to a January 2017 Pipeline and Gas Journal report, there were approximately 32,000 miles of new and planned pipeline projects within North America. Technological advances that have increased available oil and gas reserves, combined with increasingly cost-effective production technologies, are expected to continue to drive demand for U.S. oil and gas production, creating expanded opportunities for new pipeline infrastructure throughout North America. In addition, opportunities may exist for upgrades to existing pipeline infrastructure from safety regulations. We believe that these trends, along with the expected benefit to our customers of lower corporate income tax rates and the accelerated depreciation provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, as well as recent trends toward more favorable permitting and regulatory approval processes, will support continued expanded levels of project activity, creating a multi-year cycle of demand for pipeline construction projects.
In addition to potential opportunities in the U.S., Mexico has implemented energy regulation reforms to authorize and attract foreign investment in the energy sector in order to expand and revitalize its energy industry, with public and private infrastructure investments already underway. These initiatives call for a significant shift from fuel oils to more environmentally sensitive and cleaner natural gas, including a program for the long-term importation of natural gas from the U.S. to provide for cleaner and more economical electrical power generation and energy usage. In 2017, MasTec completed construction on two pipelines to move U.S. sourced natural gas to the Mexico / U.S. border. We believe there will be additional pipeline infrastructure opportunities for the delivery of U.S. natural gas to Mexico, as well as opportunities within Mexico, in the coming years. 
Industry Opportunities in our Electrical Transmission Segment 
6

The U.S. electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure requires significant ongoing maintenance, upgrade and expansion to manage power line congestion and avoid delivery failures, as well as to modernize and visually improve the existing electrical system as well as strengthen aging infrastructure to withstand natural disasters and potential cyber attacks. In addition, we believe that regional shifts in population and industry and increasing trends towards the use of electric vehicles, could create incremental demand for transmission and distribution construction and upgrades. Electrical grid expansions in Canada and Mexico may also create opportunities for electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure services. Additionally, the increasing demand for, and expected growth in deployment of, renewable energy electrical power generation has implications for transmission spending.  Wind and solar power generation resources are typically located in remote areas far away from industrial users and major population centers.  As a result, significant spending for renewable energy transmission lines may be required to interconnect these new sources of power with the electrical grid. According to the DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2018, approximately 260 gigawatts of new electricity generating capacity are expected to be added through 2050, requiring significant investment in transmission and distribution by electric utility companies.
We believe significant capital investment in the transmission and distribution system will continue to be required to meet these needs, and that MasTec is well positioned in this sector.
Industry Opportunities in our Power Generation and Industrial Segment
The DOE’s World Energy Outlook 2017 predicts that renewable power generation will contribute 40% of all power generation by 2040. The falling costs of clean energy technologies, coupled with the desire to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports and the desire of more and more customers for increasingly “green” power sources, have created demand for more domestic, environmentally sensitive electrical power production, such as wind and solar collection farms as well as biomass facilities. Currently, almost 40 states, as well as the District of Columbia and four territories, have adopted renewable portfolio standards or goals. The DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2018 projected approximately 80 gigawatts of new wind and solar capacity from 2018 to 2021. These trends, as well as certain tax incentives currently applicable to the renewables industry, are expected to continue to drive demand for construction of renewable resources throughout North America in the coming years. We believe we are one of the leading renewables contractors in North America, with expertise in wind, solar and industrial plant construction, and expect to benefit from these market trends.
The renewable energy industry is somewhat reliant on federal and state tax incentives, which have limited terms.  Currently, there are certain federal tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry, including production and investment tax credits that have historically increased investments in these projects.  Other tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry include accelerated tax depreciation provisions, including bonus depreciation, for certain renewable energy generation assets, such as equipment using solar or wind energy, or energy from geothermal deposits or biomass. Notwithstanding the potential phase-out of these tax incentives, certain rate-based utilities, which comprise many of MasTec’s customers in this industry, have expressed an interest in continued “green” power generation. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - The renewable energy industry is reliant on tax incentives, the availability of which may be uncertain and could adversely affect demand for our services.”
Industrial plant construction opportunities exist in a wide variety of industries, including in the renewable energy industry. The low price of natural gas is expected to spur the construction of new gas-fired electrical generating plants, conversions of coal-fired power plants to cleaner natural gas and the construction of other plants which use natural gas as a fuel source. Industrial facilities and plants that support the biofuels, food processing, natural gas, petroleum and related industries present opportunities as additional domestic energy reserves are produced, transported and processed. 
Competitive Strengths
Our competitive strengths include: 
Diverse Customer Relationships. We serve a diversified customer and industry base. Our customers include some of the largest communications, utility and power companies in North America. We have longstanding relationships and have developed strong alliances with many of our customers, and we strive to maintain these customer relationships and our status as a preferred vendor to our customers.

Generally, key management personnel of acquired businesses continue to work for us under employment or services agreements. 
Environmental, Social and Governance Matters
We are committed to socially responsible investing and corporate practices. We are one of the largest renewables contractors in North America, having constructed a significant percentage of North America’s wind farms. Our renewables business also builds solar power plants and biofuel/biomass 
7

infrastructure. In addition, we have received awards from our customers for our efforts in sustainability practices. We are also committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. 
In our largest fleet operation, we have developed sophisticated routing, scheduling and fuel management programs that significantly reduce our consumption of fuel. In addition, as part of our effort to reduce our overall carbon footprint, we have invested in equipment that is equipped with advanced emissions reduction technologies. We also have recycling programs for discarded materials and programs for the proper disposition of hazardous wastes. 
 In our Oil and Gas segment, we perform engineering, construction and maintenance services on oil and natural gas pipelines and processing facilities for the energy and utilities industries. In many cases, we are helping consumers and customers access cleaner burning natural gas by providing transportation infrastructure for businesses and consumers that wish to switch to these cleaner burning and lower carbon fuel sources. We also provide state-of-the-art pipeline transportation options, which consume fewer hydrocarbons in the transportation process than do traditional truck and rail transport.
We seek to align the interests of our Board of Directors and management with that of our shareholders. We believe that an independent, well-diversified Board makes us a better corporate citizen, and we have a Board with racial, ethnic, gender and skill diversity.  We also believe that our separation of Chairman and CEO further enhances accountability and social responsibility. Our management team and our Board of Directors also have significant ownership in MasTec’s common stock, which further aligns their interests with those of our other shareholders.  
We have detailed governance procedures, including an Audit Committee Charter, a Compensation Committee Charter and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, as well as a comprehensive Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Director and Communication Principles and Board of Director Governance Principles, all of which can be reviewed on the “Investors” page of our website at MasTec.com.
Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are as follows: 
Focus on Growth Opportunities. We believe that our end-markets offer multiple growth opportunities, and we expect continued spending by key customers in many of the industries we serve. We expect development of oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure, wireless and wireline/fiber infrastructure, expansion and upgrades of electrical transmission capacity and the distribution grid, development of power generation infrastructure, including renewable energy sources, and heavy industrial and civil construction projects, to be areas of investment and opportunity in the coming years. We intend to use our broad geographic presence, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, customer relationships and full range of services to capitalize on these trends and grow our business. 
Operational Excellence. We seek to improve our profit margins and cash flows by focusing on profitable services and projects that have high margin potential. We also strive to identify opportunities for leverage within our business, such as deploying resources across multiple customers and projects in order to enhance our operating effectiveness and utilization rates, while continuing to maintain strong working capital management practices. We continue to pursue actions and programs designed to achieve these goals, such as increasing accountability throughout our organization, effectively managing customer contract bidding procedures, evaluating opportunities to improve our working capital cycle time through contractual provisions and certain financing arrangements, hiring and retaining experienced operating and financial professionals, and expanding and further integrating the use of our financial and other management information systems.
Maintain Conservative Capital Structure. We evaluate our capital structure on an ongoing basis and have expanded our financial resources in recent years. We believe that we have sufficient capital resources to fund our planned operations and had approximately $565 million of borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017. We have aggregate borrowing commitments of $1.5 billion under our senior secured credit facility and $400 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2023. We may consider opportunities to borrow additional funds, or to refinance, repurchase or retire outstanding debt or repurchase shares in the future as part of our ongoing capital structure evaluation. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources,” for details pertaining to our debt instruments.
Leverage Core Performance and Expertise through Strategic Acquisitions and Other Arrangements. We may pursue selected acquisitions, investments and strategic arrangements that allow us to expand our operations, service offerings, customer base or geographic reach. We have diversified our business and expanded our service offerings and geographic footprint in recent years, both organically and through acquisition. To maximize the potential of acquired businesses, our strategy includes timely and efficient integration of acquired businesses into our operations and internal control environment. We evaluate our business on a regular basis, and from time to time, we may divest certain businesses or assets, or curtail selected business activities or operations that do not produce adequate revenue or margin, or if they no longer fit within our long-term business strategy.
Services
Our core services are the engineering, building, installing, maintaining and upgrading of infrastructure, primarily for communications, oil and gas, utility and power generation customers. We provide similar services to each of these customers, including: 
Build. We build infrastructure projects for customers across a range of industries. We specialize in building underground and overhead distribution systems, including trenches, conduits, cable and power lines, which provide wireless and wireline/fiber communications; natural gas, crude oil and refined product transport pipelines; electrical power generation, transmission and distribution systems; power generation infrastructure, including renewable energy; heavy industrial plants; compressor and pump stations and treatment plants; water and sewer infrastructure; and other civil construction infrastructure.
Install. We install electrical and other energy distribution and transmission systems, power generation facilities, buried and aerial fiber optic and other cables, satellite dishes, home security, home automation and energy management solutions in a variety of environments for our customers. In connection with our installation work, we deploy and manage network connections that involve our customers’ hardware, software and network equipment. 
8

Maintain and Upgrade. We offer 24 hour/365 days-a-year maintenance and upgrade support to our customers. Our comprehensive service offerings include the regular maintenance of our customers’ distribution facilities, networks and infrastructure, including natural gas and petroleum pipeline, communications, electrical distribution and transmission, power generation and heavy civil infrastructure. We also provide emergency services for accidents or storm damage. Our upgrade work ranges from routine replacements and upgrades to major overhauls. 
Customers 
We have longstanding relationships with many customers, and often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which are generally multi-year agreements. Our master service agreements are typically exclusive up to a specified dollar amount per work order for each defined geographic area, but do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us. Work performed under master service and other service agreements is usually generated through work orders, each of which is performed for a fixed fee. Services provided under these agreements range from engineering, project management and installation work to maintenance and upgrade services. Master service and other service agreements are frequently awarded on a competitive bidding basis, although customers are sometimes willing to negotiate contract extensions beyond their original terms without re-bidding. Our master service and other service agreements have various terms, depending upon the nature of the services provided, and typically provide for termination on short or no advance notice. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 36%, 43% and 48% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from projects performed under master service and other service agreements. 
The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs requiring the construction and installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an entire infrastructure system. Customers are billed with varying frequency, generally monthly or upon attaining specific milestones. Such contracts may include retainage provisions, under which a portion of the contract amount (generally, from 5% to 10% of billings) can be withheld from us until the work has been completed and accepted by the customer. 
We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise and reputation for customer service, as well as the relationships developed between our customers and our senior management and project management teams are important to our being retained by our customers. See Note 13 - Segments and Related Information and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference, for customer concentration information. 
Backlog
Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the next 18 months from future work on uncompleted construction contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. Our estimated backlog also includes amounts under master service and other service agreements and includes our proportionate share of estimated revenue from proportionately consolidated non-controlled contractual joint ventures. Estimated backlog for work under master service and other service agreements is determined based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. We expect to realize approximately 80% of our estimated year end 2017 backlog in 2018. The following table presents 18-month backlog by reportable segment, as of the dates indicated:

Reportable Segment (in millions): | December 31, 2017 | | September 30, 2017 | | December 31, 2016
Communications | $ | 3,628 | | | $ | 3,505 | | $ | 2,824
Oil and Gas | 2,525 | | | 907 | | | 2,223
Electrical Transmission | 354 | | | 268 | | | 257 
Power Generation and Industrial | 577 | | | 331 | | | 109 
Other | 3 | | | 3 | | | 6 
Estimated 18-month backlog | $ | 7,087 | | | $ | 5,014 | | $ | 5,419

Approximately half of our backlog as of December 31, 2017 is attributable to amounts under master service or other service agreements, pursuant to which our customers are not contractually committed to purchase a minimum amount of services. Most of these agreements can be canceled on short or no advance notice. Timing of revenue for construction and installation projects included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of customer delays, regulatory factors and/or other project-related factors. These changes could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. In the past, we have occasionally experienced postponements, cancellations and reductions in expected future work from master service agreements due to changes in our customers’ spending plans, as well as on construction projects due to market volatility and regulatory factors. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or the accuracy of our estimates. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings. 
Backlog is not a term recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”); however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not, however, be comparable to the methodologies used by others. 
Sales and Marketing
Our customers increasingly require resources from multiple disciplines. Therefore, our subsidiary services companies market their services not only individually, but also in combination with other companies, including other MasTec companies and independent companies, to provide what we believe are the most efficient and effective solutions to meet our customers’ demands. Through our unified MasTec® brand and an integrated organizational structure designed to permit rapid deployment of labor, equipment and materials, we are able to quickly and efficiently allocate resources to meet customer needs. We offer services that are branded under the MasTec® service mark and other service marks. 
We have developed a marketing plan emphasizing the MasTec® registered service mark and trade names of certain acquired companies, as well as an integrated service offering to position ourselves as a provider of a full range of service solutions, providing services including installation as 
9

well as sophisticated engineering, design and integration. We believe our longstanding relationships with customers and our reputation for reliability and efficiency facilitate our recurring business. Our marketing efforts are principally carried out by the management of our business units and project groups in coordination with our corporate business development organization. Our management team has many years of industry experience, both at the service provider level, and in some cases, with the customers we serve. Our business unit and project group managers market directly to existing and potential customers for new contracts and also seek our inclusion on lists of vendors invited to submit proposals for service agreements and individual projects. We also market our services in conjunction with certain business partners, strategic investments and arrangements. Our executive management supplements these efforts at the national and international level. 
Safety and Insurance/Risk Management
We strive to instill and enforce safe work habits in our employees, and we require that our employees participate in training programs relevant to their employment, including all those required by law. We evaluate employees in part based upon their safety records and the safety records of the employees they supervise. Our business units have established robust safety programs to monitor and improve compliance with safety procedures and regulations. 
Our business involves the use of heavy equipment and exposure to potentially dangerous workplace conditions. While we are committed to operating safely and prudently, we are subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries that occur in connection with our work. Our insurance policies are subject to high deductibles and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. We maintain insurance policies for workers’ compensation, general liability and automobile liability that are subject to per claim deductibles. We also maintain excess umbrella coverage and an insurance policy with respect to employee group medical claims, which is subject to annual per employee maximum losses. We are required to post letters of credit and provide cash collateral to certain of our insurance carriers and to provide surety bonds in certain states. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. 
Suppliers, Materials and Working Capital
Under many of our contracts, our customers provide the necessary materials and supplies for projects and we are responsible for the installation of, but not the cost or warranty of those materials. Under certain other projects, we purchase the necessary materials and supplies on behalf of our customers from third-party providers. We are not dependent on any one vendor and have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining project-related materials or supplies as and when required for the projects we manage. 
We utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help us manage our work flow. Our independent contractors typically provide their own vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. We are not dependent on any one independent contractor. We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, including the spending patterns of our customers and the effects of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work, both of which can influence the timing of spending to support related customer demand. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Working Capital,” which is incorporated by reference. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate, ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms. The national or large regional firms that compete with us include Quanta Services, Inc., MYR Group, Inc., Dycom Industries, Inc., Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Primoris Services Corporation, Pike Electric, Inc., Bechtel Corporation, D.H. Blattner & Sons, Inc., M.A. Mortenson Company, Black & Veatch and Nexius.
Certain barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate, including adequate financial resources, technical expertise, high safety ratings and a proven track record of operational success. Some of our customers employ their own personnel to perform infrastructure services of the type we provide. We compete based upon our industry experience, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, geographic presence, industry reputation, safety record and reputation for customer service. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they award most of their work through a bid process, and price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected. 
Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally, including laws and regulations related to labor relations, wages, worker safety and environmental protection. While many of our customers operate in regulated industries (for example, utilities regulated by the public service commission or communications companies regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), we are not generally subject to such regulation and oversight. 
As a contractor, our operations are subject to various laws, including: 

• | regulations related to worker safety and health, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and state equivalents;


• | regulations related to vehicle registrations, including those of the states and the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”);


• | contractor licensing requirements;

We are also subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and programs, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, laws governing emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface

water, groundwater and soil, and programs related to the protection of endangered species. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business. In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.” 
We believe we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. However, we could incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.
