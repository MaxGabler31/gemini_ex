ITEM 1. Business
Corporate Overview
 
Nuo Therapeutics, Inc. is a Delaware corporation organized in 1998 under the name Informatix Holdings, Inc. In 1999, Autologous Wound Therapy, Inc., an Arkansas Corporation, merged with and into Informatix Holdings, Inc. and the name of the surviving corporation was changed to Autologous Wound Therapy, Inc. In 2000, Autologous Wound Therapy, Inc. changed its name to Cytomedix, Inc. (“Cytomedix”). In 2001, Cytomedix, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States (“U.S.”) Bankruptcy Code, after which Cytomedix was authorized to continue to conduct its business as a debtor and debtor-in-possession. Cytomedix emerged from bankruptcy in 2002 under a Plan of Reorganization. In September 2007, Cytomedix received 510(k) clearance for the Aurix System (“Aurix”), formerly known as the AutoloGel™ System, from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). In April 2010, Cytomedix acquired the Angel Whole Blood Separation System (“Angel”) and the Angel Business, from Sorin Group USA, Inc. In February 2012, Cytomedix, acquired Aldagen, Inc. (“Aldagen”), a privately held developmental cell-therapy company located in Durham, NC. In 2014, Cytomedix changed its name to Nuo Therapeutics, Inc. In 2016, Nuo filed for and emerged from bankruptcy under Chapter 11 as described below under “- 2016 Bankruptcy and Emergence from Bankruptcy.” Effective May 1, 2019, Nuo furloughed its remaining employees and ceased standard operational activities as it awaited developments concerning its reconsideration request with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) regarding Medicare coverage for Aurix. Based on a favorable National Coverage Determination issued in April 2021, Nuo initiated restart activities for the business beginning in October 2021 with an expectation that the Aurix product will be available for commercial sale by May 2022. Aldagen is a non-operational, wholly owned subsidiary of Nuo. Our principal offices are presently located in Houston, Texas.
Our Business 
 
We are a regenerative therapies company focused on developing and marketing products for chronic wound care primarily within the U.S. We commercialize innovative cell-based technologies that harness the regenerative capacity of the human body to trigger natural healing. The use of autologous (i.e., from self, the patient’s own) biological therapies for tissue repair and regeneration is part of a clinical strategy designed to improve long-term recovery in inherently complex chronic conditions with significant unmet medical needs.
 
Our current commercial offering consists of a point of care technology for the safe and effective separation of autologous blood to produce a platelet-based therapy for the chronic wound care market. This offering is known as “Aurix” or the “Aurix System”. The FDA cleared the Aurix System for marketing in 2007 as a device under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Aurix is one of two platelet derived products cleared by the FDA for chronic wound care use and is indicated for most exuding wounds. The advanced wound care market, within which Aurix competes, is composed of advanced wound care dressings, wound care devices, and wound care biologics, and is estimated to be an approximate $10.8 billion global market in 2021 with the North American market estimated at approximately $4.15 billion in 2020. Estimates remain that 1-2% of population in the developed countries will suffer from a chronic wound at least once in their lifetime. According to the National Institute of Health, treatment of diabetic foot ulcers cost an estimated $9-$13 billion annually in the U.S. alone. An aging population and the still increasing prevalence of diabetes suggests a continued increase in the patient population at risk of developing chronic, non-healing wounds.
 
The Aurix System produces a platelet rich plasma (“PRP”) gel at the point of care using the patient’s own platelets and plasma sourced from a small draw of peripheral blood. Aurix comprises a natural, endogenous complement of protein and non-protein signal molecules that contribute to effective healing. During treatment, the patient’s platelets are activated and release hundreds of growth factor proteins and other signaling molecules that form a biologically active hematogel. Aurix delivers concentrations of the natural complement of cytokines, growth factors and chemokines that are known to regulate angiogenesis (i.e., the development of new blood vessels), cell growth, and the formation of new tissue. Once applied to the prepared wound bed, the biologically active Aurix hematogel can restore the balance in the wound environment to transform a non-healing wound to a wound that heals naturally.

In 2012, a Medicare National Coverage Determination (“NCD”) from CMS reversed a twenty-year old non-coverage decision for autologous blood derived products used in wound care. This NCD allowed for Medicare coverage under the Coverage with Evidence Development (“CED”) program.  CED programs have been employed for a selected number variety of other therapies, including transcatheter aortic valve repair and cochlear implantation.  Under the CED program, CMS provides reimbursement for items or services on the condition that they be furnished in approved clinical protocols or in the collection of additional clinical data.  Under the CED program, a facility treating a patient with Aurix was reimbursed by Medicare when health outcomes data were collected to inform future coverage decisions. The intent of the CED program is to evaluate the outcomes of Aurix therapy for the broader Medicare population when it is used in a “real world” continuum of care.  
 
On May 17, 2019, we transmitted a letter memorandum to CMS’ Coverage and Analysis Group (“CAG”) in support of our complete formal request for reconsideration of the then existing national coverage determination based on clinical data collected and published under the CED program. The complete formal public request for reconsideration was made on May 8, 2019 in accordance with the applicable requirements.
 
On April 13, 2021, CMS issued a final coverage decision memo indicating that Medicare would nationally cover autologous PRP for the treatment of chronic non-healing diabetic wounds for a duration of 20 weeks under Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act. This coverage applies when using devices whose FDA-cleared indications include the management of exuding cutaneous wounds, such as diabetic ulcers. Coverage of autologous PRP beyond 20 weeks for diabetic foot ulcers and for the treatment of all other chronic, non-diabetic, non-healing wounds will be determined by local Medicare Administrative Contractors.
 
Although FDA cleared the Aurix System for marketing in 2007 under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, CMS only established economically viable reimbursement for the product beginning in 2016. For 2022, the CMS national average reimbursement rate for the Aurix System is $1,749 per treatment, which we believe provides appropriate payment to facilities for product usage. We will market the Aurix System at an approximate cost of $800 per treatment to wound care providers.
 
Our Strategy
 
Upon the expected re-initiation of commercial sales activities by May 2022, our immediate focus will be on engagement with providers treating chronic non-healing wounds to describe the clinical benefits we believe result from the use of Aurix in the treatment of complex wounds. Increasing physician awareness of the differentiating attributes of Aurix will be key to establishing a base of product revenues upon which to grow.
 
Over the period from the cessation of normal operational activities in May 2019 through the final NCD in April 2021 leading to the decision to reinitiate business activities, the Company was focused on engaging with CMS as appropriate, monitoring the developments concerning our reconsideration request, advancing our positions during various public comment periods and maintaining overall yet limited corporate viability in the event that a sufficiently favorable coverage and reimbursement setting developed for Aurix.
 
In addition, the Company took actions during this period to address its capital structure by eliminating both its debt and exchanging the Series A Preferred Stock issued at the time of the May 2016 recapitalization for common stock.
 
The Science Underlying Aurix/Platelet Rich Plasma
 
Normal Wound Healing
 
The science underlying wound healing is well-established. An immediate early event critical for wound healing is the influx of platelets to the wound site. Platelets bind to elements within damaged tissue such as collagen fragments and endogenous thrombin molecules and are activated to release a diversity of growth factors and other biomolecules from their alpha and dense granules (Reed 2000, Nieswandt, 2003). These biomolecules provide signals essential for biological responses regulating hemostasis and effective tissue regeneration.
 
    2 

  

Chronic Wounds
 
Dysregulation of numerous cellular and biological responses contribute to the chronic wound phenotype. Chronic wounds have reduced levels of growth factors and concomitant decreases in cellular proliferation (Mast 1996). There is increased cellular senescence (Telgenhoff 2005), and there generally is a lack of perfusion that can inhibit the delivery of nutrients and cells required for regeneration (Guo 2010). As the body attempts to stave off infection, elevated concentrations of free radicals accumulate in the chronic wound and further damage surrounding tissue (Moseley 2004, James 2003).
Aurix Therapy
 
Aurix has been cleared by FDA as safe and effective with an indication for chronic wounds such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, and diabetic ulcers and other exuding wounds such as mechanically or surgically debrided wounds. The Aurix therapeutic is formed by mixing a sample of a patient’s platelets and plasma with pharmaceutical grade thrombin and ascorbic acid. The thrombin activates platelets while ascorbic acid drives the synthesis of high tensile strength collagen, clears damaging free radicals and controls gel consistency. The topical dermal application of Aurix gel bypasses the lack of local perfusion to provide immediate signals for new tissue formation and ultimately healing.
The Efficacy of Aurix Relates to Biological Activity Released by Platelets
 
Regenerative Capacity
 
More than 300 proteins are released by human platelets in response to thrombin activation (Coppinger 2004). Important examples include vascular endothelial cell growth factor (“VEGF”), platelet derived growth factor (“PDGF”), epidermal growth factor (“EGF”), fibroblast growth factor (“FGF”) and transforming growth factor-beta (“TGF-B”) (Eppley 2004, Everts 2006). These proteins are critical for organized wound healing, regulating responses such as vascularization, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and deposition of new extracellular matrix (Goldman 2004). Platelets also release chemokines such as Interleukin-8 (“IL-8”), stromal cell derived factor-1 (“SDF-1”), and platelet factor-4 (“PF-4”) (Chatterjee 2011, Gear 2003) that control the mobilization and migration of stem cells and fibroblasts (Werner 2003 and Gillitzer 2001), which contribute to tissue regeneration.
Anti-infective Activity
 
Populations of bioburden in chronic wounds vary over time and wounds invariably retain or become re-infected with some level of bacteria that is detrimental to healing (Howell-Jones 2005). In addition to regenerative capacity, platelets release anti-microbial peptides effective against a broad range of pathogens including Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (“MRSA”) (Moojen 2007, Jia 2010, Tang 2002, Bielecki 2007).
Clinical Efficacy
 
Multiple efficacy and effectiveness studies have been published in peer reviewed journals documenting the impact of using Aurix to treat chronic wounds. Key data include:
 

● | In the published study of the clinical data collected during the CED program for diabetic foot ulcers, Aurix demonstrated a significant time to heal advantage compared to wounds treated with usual and customary care (including any available advanced therapy). A higher percentage of healing was observed across all wound severities (Wagner Grade 1-4) and in a patient population with significant comorbidities. (Gude W, Hagan D, Abood F, Clausen P: Aurix Gel is an Effective Intervention for Chronic Diabetic Foot Ulcers: A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial. Advances in Skin and Wound Care, 2019; 32(9): 416-426.) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In a double blinded randomized controlled trial, 81% of the most common-sized diabetic foot ulcers healed with Aurix compared with 42% of control wounds. Mean time to healing was six weeks. (Driver V, Hanft J, Fylling, C et al.: A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial of Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma Gel for the Treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers. Ostomy Wound Management, 2006; 52(6): 68-87.) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    3 

  


● | In 285 chronic wounds in 200 patients, 96.5% of the wounds had a positive response within an average of 2.2 weeks with an average of 2.8 Aurix treatments (de Leon J, Driver VR, Fylling CP, Carter MJ, Anderson C, Wilson J, et al.: The Clinical Relevance of Treating Chronic Wounds with an Enhanced Near-physiological Concentration of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Gel. Advances in Skin and Wound Care, 2011; 24(8), 357-368.) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In a retrospective, longitudinal study of 40 Wagner grade II through IV diabetic foot ulcers, most with critical limb ischemia, wounds increased in size in the approximate 100 days prior to the initiation of comprehensive wound care treatment. Upon treatment with debridement, revascularization, antibiotics and off-loading, the wounds continued to increase in size over a subsequent 75-day period. Once they were then treated with Aurix, the wounds immediately changed healing trajectory and 83% of the wounds healed with an average of 6.1 Aurix treatments per wound (Sakata, J., Sasaki, S., Handa, K., et al. A Retrospective, Longitudinal Study to Evaluate Healing Lower Extremity Wounds in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and Ischemia Using Standard Protocols of Care and Platelet-Rich Plasma Gel in a Japanese Wound Care Program. Ostomy Wound Management, 2012; 58(4):36-49.)

Aurix Licensing and Collaboration Arrangements
 
On October 24, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement for Sale of Intellectual Property (the “IP Sale Agreement”) and a License and Service Agreement (the “Service Agreement” and collectively the “Rohto Agreements”) with Rohto Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Rohto”), the licensee of the exclusivity rights to Aurix in Japan.
 
The IP Sale Agreement provided for the sale to Rohto of the intellectual property under license pursuant to the amended license and distribution agreement (consisting of two of our patents in Japan, our know-how in Japan and trademarks for Aurix and AutoloGel (the prior product name for Aurix) in Japan). The IP Sale Agreement provided that, upon the completion of such transfers and payments, the amended license and distribution agreement would be terminated. Under the IP Sale Agreement, we are subject to a five-year non-compete in Japan.
 
Under the Service Agreement, we agreed to the sale of a patent application in Brazil, the grant of a royalty-free license to our know how in the Field of Use in Brazil and India, and the grant of a royalty-free non-exclusive license to the use of our device patent in the Field of Use in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The latter license becomes effective if and only if we cease our business with respect to the Aurix System or grant a non-exclusive license to a third party to use the device patent in the Field of Use in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The “Field of Use” is defined as the use of the Aurix System and a modified medical device being developed by Rohto under the Japan patents sold to Rohto for all wound care and topical dermatology applications in human and animal medicine. Under the Service Agreement, we are subject to a non-compete in Brazil and India.
 
The aggregate consideration received under the Rohto Agreements was $750,000.

Effective as of May 5, 2016, the Company and Boyalife Hong Kong Ltd. (“Boyalife”), an entity affiliated with the Company’s significant stockholder, Boyalife Investment Fund I, Inc., entered into an Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with an initial term of five years, unless the Distribution Agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. Under the Distribution Agreement, Boyalife received a non-transferable, exclusive license, with limited right to sublicense, to use certain of the Company’s intellectual property relating to its Aurix System. In particular, Boyalife is entitled to import, use for development, promote, market, sell and distribute the Aurix Products in greater China (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau) for all regenerative medicine applications, including but not limited to wound care and topical dermatology applications in human and veterinary medicine. For purposes of the Distribution Agreement, “Aurix Products” are defined as the combination of devices to produce a wound dressing from the patient’s blood, as of May 5, 2016 consisting of centrifuge, wound dressing kit and reagent kit. Under the Distribution Agreement, Boyalife is obligated to pay the Company (a) $500,000 within 90 days of approval of the Aurix Products by the China Food and Drug Administration, but no earlier than December 31, 2018, and (b) a distribution fee per wound dressing kit and reagent kit of $40, payable quarterly, subject to an agreement by the parties to discuss in good faith the appropriate distribution fee if the pricing of such kits exceeds the current general pricing in greater China. Under the Distribution Agreement, Boyalife is entitled, with the Company’s approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to procure devices from a third party in order to assemble them with devices supplied by the Company to make the Aurix Products. Boyalife also has a right of first refusal with respect to the Aurix Products in specified countries in the Asia Pacific region excluding Japan and India, exercisable in exchange for a payment of no greater than $250,000 in the aggregate. If Boyalife files a new patent application for a new invention relating to wound dressings, the Aurix Products or the Company’s technology, Boyalife will grant the Company a free, non-exclusive license to use such patent application outside greater China during the term of the Distribution Agreement.
 
Customer Concentration
 
As a result of the circumstances described above, we had no revenues in 2021 or 2020. In 2019, our revenues consisted of product sales of approximately $146,000 as we concluded study treatments under the CED program and sold the remaining Aurix inventory to select wound care facilities.
Licenses and Property Rights 
 
Nuo relies on a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, copyright laws as well as confidentiality agreements, contractual provisions, and other similar measures, to establish and protect its business interests. 
 
On September 28, 2018, Aldagen entered into a first amendment (the “Amendment”) to the existing license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with STEMCELL Technologies Canada, Inc. (previously known as STEMCELL Technologies, Inc.) (“STEMCELL”) to provide for the buyout by STEMCELL of the remaining royalty obligations under the License Agreement in exchange for a payment of $195,000. Upon receipt of the payments of $100,000 on October 31, 2018 and $95,000 on December 15, 2018, STEMCELL had a fully paid up, irrevocable and royalty free license to the intellectual property under the License Agreement for the Aldeflour product sold by STEMCELL. Aldagen additionally agreed to the transfer of the Aldeflour trademark to STEMCELL upon receipt of the final payment described above.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, and other countries extensively regulate pharmaceutical products, biologics, and medical devices. The Company’s products and product candidates are subject to approval or clearance by the governing bodies prior to and during the marketing and distribution of a product. Regulatory requirements apply to, but are not limited to, research and development, safety and efficacy, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, advertising and marketing, and the import and export of products. Before a product candidate is approved by the governing bodies for commercial marketing, rigorous preclinical and human clinical testing may be necessary to conduct to determine the safety and efficacy or effectiveness of the product. If the Company fails to comply with the applicable laws and regulations at any time during the product development process, approval, or clearance process, or during commercialization, it may become subject to administrative and/or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, refusal to approve or clear pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of the Company’s operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Any enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Medical Device Regulation
 
The Company expects to again manufacture and distribute the Aurix System again by May 2022. As such, this and future products manufactured and/or distributed by the Company may be subject to regulations by the applicable governing bodies, including but not limited to, the FDA, Health Canada, the European Medicines Agency, the Japanese Ministry of Health & Welfare, and other regulatory agencies. The Company currently has no meaningful business development initiatives outside of the U.S. Each of the foreign governing bodies noted above serve a similar function as the FDA. As such, the Company and its products and product candidates are subject to the regulations enforced by the outside governing bodies. These regulations include, but are not limited to, product clearance, documentation requirements, good manufacturing practices and medical device reporting. Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, in certain circumstances. Current enforcement policies prohibit the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. Each governing body reviews the labeling and advertising of medical devices to ensure that unapproved uses are not promoted. Before a new medical device can be introduced to the market, the manufacturer must obtain clearance or approval from the applicable regulatory agency, depending upon the device classification. In the U.S., medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, II, or III. The regulations enforced by the FDA and/or the appropriate governing bodies to the medical device(s) provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective. In the U.S., Class I devices are non-critical products that the FDA believes can be adequately regulated by “general controls” which include provisions relating to labeling, manufacturer registration, defect notification, records and reports, and current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, based on the FDA’s Quality Systems Regulations. Most Class I devices are exempt from pre-market notification and some are also exempt from cGMP requirements. Class II devices are products for which the general controls of Class I devices, by themselves, are not sufficient to assure safety and effectiveness and, therefore, require additional controls. Additional controls for Class II devices may include performance standards, post-market surveillance patient registries, and the use of FDA guidelines. Standards may include both design and performance requirements. Class III devices have the most restrictive controls and require pre-market approval by the FDA. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. All of the governing bodies with responsibility over the Company’s products have the ability to inspect medical device manufacturers, order recalls of medical devices in some circumstances, seize non-complying medical devices, and to pursue prosecution of either civil or criminal violations.
 
Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) requires individuals or companies manufacturing medical devices intended for human use to file a notice with the FDA at least ninety days before intending to introduce the device into the market. This notice, commonly referred to as a 510(k) premarket notification, must identify the type of classified device into which the product falls, the class of that type, and a specific product already being marketed or cleared by the FDA and to which the product is “substantially equivalent.” In some instances, the 510(k) must include data from human clinical studies to establish “substantial equivalence.” The FDA must agree with the claim of “substantial equivalence” before the device can be marketed. The statutory time frame for clearance of a 510(k) is ninety days, though it often takes longer. Nuo currently only markets a product that is subject to 510(k) clearance.
 
The Company expects to market the Aurix System by May 2022, consisting of the Aurix Wound Dressing Kit, Aurix Reagent Kit, and Aurix System Centrifuge II. Each component of the Aurix System is a legally marketed product that has been cleared by FDA. The Aurix System Centrifuge II, when used with the Aurix Wound Dressing Kit and Aurix Reagent Kit, are suitable for use on exuding wounds such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and diabetic ulcers, and for the management of mechanically or surgically debrided wounds.
 
As a specification developer, manufacturer, and distributor of medical devices, the Company complies with other regulations and standards, such as the FDCA and implementing regulations set forth in 21 CFR et seq. and also ISO 13485. As a manufacturer and distributor of medical devices, the Company, and in some instances its subcontractors, is required to register its facilities and products manufactured annually with the appropriate governing bodies and certain state agencies. Additionally, the Company is subject to periodic inspections by the governing bodies to assess compliance with cGMP regulations. Facilities may also be subject to inspections by other federal, foreign, state, or local agencies. Accordingly, manufacturers such as the Company must continue to expend time, money, and effort around production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
The Company may also be indirectly subject to federal and state anti-kickback and physician self-referral laws. Federal physician self-referral legislation (commonly known as the Stark Law) prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain designated health services (“DHS”) if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral, and any person collecting any amounts in connection with an unlawful referral is obligated to refund such amounts. CMS has issued numerous regulations containing exceptions to the prohibitions of the Stark Law. If a physician and a DHS entity have financial relationship subject to the Stark Law, then an exception must be met or else the DHS entity cannot bill for the service. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. The penalties for violating the Stark Law also include civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per referral and possible exclusion from federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the Stark Law have also been the basis for False Claims Act actions, discussed below. Various states have corollary laws to the Stark Law (so-called “baby Stark” laws), including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a health care provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider. Both the scope and exception for such laws vary from state to state.
 
The Company may also be subject to federal and state anti-kickback laws. Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Law, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Law is broad, and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are otherwise lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. The Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) has issued regulations, commonly known as “safe harbors” that set forth certain provisions which, if fully met, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Law. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Law, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Law will be pursued. As with the Stark Law, violations of the Anti-Kickback Law can result in a False Claims Act action. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law, and some of these state prohibitions apply to patients for health care services reimbursed by any source, not only federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. 
 
In addition, there are other U.S. health care fraud laws to which the Company may be subject that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers (“fraud on a health benefit plan”) and that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. These laws apply to any health benefit plan, not just Medicare and Medicaid. 
 
The Company may also be subject to other U.S. laws that prohibit submitting, or causing to be submitted, claims for payment or causing such claims to be submitted that are false. Violation of these false claims’ statutes may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health programs. These statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the knowing filing of a false claim (or causing the submission of a false claim) or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the U.S. federal government. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the failure to report and refund an overpayment to the Medicare or Medicaid programs within 60 days of the identification of the overpayment may also be an obligation subjecting the defendant to a False Claims Act action. Finally, a recent U.S. Supreme Court case, Universal Health Services v. United States ex rel. Escobar, upheld the “implied false certification” theory under which a defendant submits a claim for payment that makes a specific representation about the goods or services provider, but fails to disclose the defendant’s noncompliance with a statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement that would be material to the Government’s payment decision. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, the entity must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties. Suits filed under the False Claims Act can be brought by an individual on behalf of the government (a “qui tam action”). Such individuals (known as “qui tam relators”) may share in the amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the False Claims Act. “Qui tam” actions have increased significantly in recent years causing greater numbers of health care companies to have to defend false claim actions, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state health care programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.

Several states also have referral, fee splitting and other similar laws that may restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration in connection with the purchase or rental of medical equipment and supplies. State laws vary in scope and have been infrequently interpreted by courts and regulatory agencies but may apply to all health care products and services, regardless of whether Medicaid or Medicare funds are involved.
 
Employees
 
The Company had only one part-time non-compensated employee as of December 31, 2021. As of January 1, 2022, the Company initiated limited hiring practices and, as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has five employees of which four are compensated as salaried employees. None of the Company’s employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred no costs for research and development activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred approximately $181,000 of costs for research and development activities.
Competition
 
While Aurix has limited competition in the chronic wound care market from any other FDA cleared platelet derived products, we face competition from pharmaceutical companies, biopharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, and other competitors in the areas of advanced wound care dressings, wound care devices, and wound care biologics. Leading companies in the advanced wound care market include Smith and Nephew, 3M, MoInlycke, and ConvaTec.  Leading competitors in the wound care market that offer other biologic products such as tissue-based products include companies such as MiMedx, Organogenesis, Integra Life Sciences, as well as a significant number of smaller companies.  While we believe that Aurix can compete favorably on the basis of broad application across multiple wound etiologies, we expect that many physicians and allied professionals will continue to employ other treatment approaches and technologies, separately and in combination, in an attempt to treat chronic and hard-to heal wounds.  The chronic wound market has many therapies that compete with Aurix that have established habitual use patterns and provider contracts to encourage standardized use.  Furthermore, other companies have developed or are developing products that could be in direct future competition with our current product line.   We may not be able to compete effectively against such companies. Many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources, larger marketing staffs and more experience in commercializing products than we do. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business, Industry, and Regulatory Approval of Our Product -  Our Product Has Existing Competition in the Marketplace.”

A reagent, bovine thrombin (Thrombin JMI), used for our Aurix product is available exclusively through Pfizer. Pfizer may unilaterally raise the price for the reagent. If a temporary or permanent interruption in the supply of the reagent were to occur, or the manufacturing costs charged by Pfizer exceed what we can reasonably afford, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
2016 Bankruptcy and Emergence from Bankruptcy
 
On January 26, 2016, the Company filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, or the Bankruptcy Court, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code, or the Bankruptcy Code, which is administered under the caption “In re: Nuo Therapeutics, Inc.”, Case No. 16-10192 (MFW). We refer to this petition and the related case as the Chapter 11 Case. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Case, the Company continued to operate its business as a “debtor-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.

The Company emerged from bankruptcy protection effective May 5, 2016 in accordance with the Modified First Amended Plan of Reorganization of the Debtor under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, as confirmed by the April 25, 2016 Order Granting Final Approval of Disclosure Statement and Confirming Debtor’s Plan of Reorganization. We refer to May 5, 2016 as the Effective Date, to the order as the Confirmation Order and to the plan of reorganization, as confirmed by the Confirmation Order, as the Plan of Reorganization.
 
Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, as of the Effective Date all equity interests of the Company, including shares of the Company’s common stock (including its redeemable common stock), warrants and options, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date were cancelled, and the Company issued new common stock, warrants and Series A preferred stock. Unless the context otherwise indicates, references in this Annual Report to common stock are to the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share issued by the Company on and after the Effective Date.
 
On the Effective Date, the Company filed a Certificate of Designations of Series A Preferred Stock, or Certificate of Designations, with the Delaware Secretary of State, designating 29,038 shares of the Company's undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, as Series A preferred stock, or Series A Preferred Stock. On the Effective Date, the Company issued 29,038 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to creditors affiliated with Deerfield Management Company, L.P., in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization. We refer to Deerfield Management Company, L.P. and its affiliates Deerfield Private Design Fund II, L.P., Deerfield Private Design International II, L.P., and Deerfield Special Situations Fund, L.P. collectively as Deerfield. The Series A Preferred Stock had no stated maturity date, was not convertible or redeemable and carried a liquidation preference of $29,038,000, which was required to be paid to holders of such Series A Preferred Stock before any payments were made with respect to shares of common stock (and other capital stock not issued on parity or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock) upon a liquidation or change in control transaction. For so long as Series A Preferred Stock was outstanding, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock had the right to nominate and elect one member of our Board of Directors. Lawrence S. Atinsky served as the designee of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock. While he served as a director of the Company, Mr. Atinsky was a Partner of Deerfield. The Series A Preferred Stock had voting rights, voting with common stock as a single class, with each share of Series A Preferred Stock having the right to five votes, then representing less than 1% of the voting rights of the capital stock of the Company, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock had the right to approve certain transactions. Among other restrictions, the Certificate of Designations for our Series A Preferred Stock limited the Company's ability to (i) issue securities that are senior or pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) incur debt (other than for working capital purposes not in excess of $3.0 million), (iii) issue securities that are junior to the Series A Preferred Stock and that provide certain consent rights to the holders of such junior securities in connection with a liquidation or contain certain liquidation preferences, (iv) pay dividends on or purchase shares of its capital stock, and (v) change the authorized number of members of its Board of Directors to a number other than five, in each case without the consent of holders representing at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares Series A Preferred Stock.
 
In accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, as of the Effective Date, the Company issued 7,500,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 6,180,000 shares of common stock to certain accredited investors in a private placement exempt from registration. The terms of the warrants provided for their expiration on May 5, 2021 and were exercisable at any time at exercise prices ranging from $0.50 per share to $0.75 per share.
 
A significant majority of the accredited investors who purchased shares of common stock on the Effective Date furthermore executed backstop commitments to purchase up to 12,800,000 additional shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $3,000,000. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company exercised its rights under the backstop commitments in full and issued an aggregate of 12,800,000 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of $3.0 million.
