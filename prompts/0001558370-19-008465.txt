 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”, “we” or “us”) is a large and growing provider of communications and bandwidth infrastructure in the United States, Canada and Europe. Our products and offerings enable our customers’ mission-critical, high-bandwidth applications, such as cloud-based computing, video, mobile, social media, machine-to-machine connectivity and other bandwidth-intensive applications. Key products include leased dark fiber, fiber to cellular towers and small cell sites, dedicated Wavelength connections, Ethernet, IP connectivity, data center colocation, cloud offerings and other high-bandwidth offerings. We provide access to our bandwidth infrastructure and other offerings over a unique set of dense metro, regional and long-haul fiber network sections and through our interconnect-oriented data center facilities. Our fiber network sections and data center facilities are critical components of the overall physical network architecture of the internet and private networks. Our customer base includes some of the largest and most sophisticated users of bandwidth infrastructure offerings, such as wireless service providers; telecommunications service providers; financial services companies; social networking, media and web content companies; education, research and healthcare institutions and governmental agencies. We typically provide our bandwidth infrastructure solutions for a fixed monthly recurring access fee under contracts that vary between one and twenty or more years in length. We operate our business with a unique focus on capital allocation and financial performance with the ultimate goal of maximizing equity value for our stockholders. Our core values center on partnership, alignment and transparency with our three primary constituent groups - employees, customers and stockholders.
 We were founded in 2007 with the investment thesis of building a bandwidth infrastructure platform to take advantage of the favorable internet, data and wireless growth trends driving the on-going demand for bandwidth infrastructure and to be an active participant in the consolidation of the industry. The growth of cloud-based computing, video, mobile and social media applications, machine-to-machine connectivity and other bandwidth-intensive applications continues to drive rapidly increasing consumption of bandwidth on a global basis. As an early believer in the enduring nature of these trends, we assembled our asset base and built a business model specifically to supply high-bandwidth infrastructure for connectivity to users whose businesses depend most on the continuous and growing demand for bandwidth. Typically, such users are given access to use our bandwidth infrastructure in return for an initial contract of at least one year and generally with options for extensions. As a core tenet of our strategy for capitalizing on these industry trends, we have been a leading industry consolidator and have acquired 45 bandwidth infrastructure businesses and assets to date. Our owned, secure and redundant fiber network and data centers serve as the foundation for our bandwidth solutions and allow us to offer customers dark fiber solutions, network connectivity and colocation and cloud infrastructure solutions. We believe the continuously growing demand for stable and secure bandwidth and infrastructure from users such as service providers, enterprises and consumers, combined with our unique and dense metro, regional and long-haul network sections, position us as a mission-critical infrastructure supplier to the largest users of bandwidth.
 Our network footprint includes both large and small metro geographies, the extended suburban regions of many cities and the large rural, national and international links that connect our metro network sections. We believe our network assets would be difficult to replicate given the geographic reach, network density and capital investment required. As of June 30, 2019, our fiber network spans 133,000 route miles and 13.0 million fiber miles (representing an average of 98 fibers per route), serves 400 geographic markets in the United States, Canada and Europe and connects to approximately 35,000 buildings, including 1,200 data centers. We own fiber network sections in large metro areas, such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Paris and London, as well as smaller metro areas, such as Allentown, Pennsylvania, Fargo, North Dakota and Spokane, Washington. Our network sections allow our customers access to our high-bandwidth infrastructure solutions over redundant fiber facilities between and among key customer locations. We believe our ownership and the location and density of our expansive network footprint allow us to more competitively satisfy our target customers’ bandwidth infrastructure solutions at the local, regional, national and international level relative to other regional bandwidth infrastructure providers or long-haul providers. We also provide our network-neutral colocation and interconnection offerings utilizing our own data centers located within major carrier hotels and other 

 
  1
 
strategic buildings in 51 locations throughout the United States, Canada and Europe and operate approximately 1 million square feet of billable colocation space.
 The density and geographic reach of our network footprint allow us to provide tailored bandwidth infrastructure solutions on our own network (“on-net”) that address the current and future bandwidth needs of our customers. Our dense metro and regional network sections have high fiber counts that enable us to provide our dark fiber solutions, network connectivity, colocation and cloud infrastructure offerings. Our network sections are deep and scalable, meaning we have spare fiber, conduit access rights and/or rights of way rights that allow us to continue to add capacity to our network as our existing and new customers’ demand for our offerings increases. In addition, many of our core network technologies provide capacity through which we can continue to add dedicated Wavelengths to our network without consuming additional fiber. We also believe the density and diversity of our network provides a strong and growing competitive barrier to protect our existing revenue base. We believe our network provides significant opportunity to organically connect to new customer locations, data centers, towers, or small cell locations to help us achieve an attractive return on our capital deployed. Since our founding, we have assembled a large portfolio of fiber network sections and colocation assets through both acquisitions and customer demand-driven investments in infrastructure property and equipment. From our inception to date, we have completed acquisitions with an aggregate purchase consideration, net of cash acquired, totaling approximately $6.7 billion. For the period from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2019, we also invested approximately $2.4 billion in capital expenditures, exclusive of acquisitions and stimulus grant reimbursements, primarily to expand the reach and capacity of our network. As of June 30, 2019, our total debt (including capital lease obligations and before any unamortized discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs) was $6,065.2 million and was primarily incurred in connection with acquisitions.
 Our business model focuses on providing on-net bandwidth infrastructure solutions to our customers, which results in what we refer to as “infrastructure economics.” Infrastructure economics are characterized by attractive revenue visibility and strong margins coupled with operating leverage for new revenue, success-based capital investments with low maintenance capital needs and the ability to generate significant cash flow over time. For the year ended June 30, 2019, approximately 90% of our revenue was recurring in nature. Our capital expenditure investments are primarily success-based, meaning that before we commit resources to expand our network, we have a signed customer contract that will provide us with an attractive return on the required capital investment. After committing capital to connect additional customer sites, our goal is to sell additional high-bandwidth connectivity on these new routes at a relatively low incremental cost, which further enhances the return we extract from our asset base. Finally, the combination of our scale and infrastructure economics results in the ability to generate meaningful free cash flow over time.
 Our management is intensely focused on creating equity value for our stockholders. Our equity value creation philosophy includes regular and rigorous financial and operational measurement, financial transparency (both internally and externally) and clear alignment of interests among employees, management and stockholders. Our real-time measurement and reporting system serves as the foundation for our decision making and our extensive financial and operational disclosure. We also believe in fostering an entrepreneurial culture that aligns the interests of our employees, management and stockholders.
 We are a Delaware corporation formed in 2007. As of June 30, 2019, we had 3,781 employees.
 Our fiscal year ends June 30 each year and we refer to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020 as “Fiscal 2020,” the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as “Fiscal 2019,” the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 as “Fiscal 2018” and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as “Fiscal 2017.”

 Bandwidth Infrastructure Industry
 We are a provider of bandwidth infrastructure solutions and our offerings are a critical component of the broader global communications industry. Bandwidth infrastructure, consisting primarily of fiber network sections and interconnect-oriented colocation facilities, plays a fundamental role in the communications value chain, similar to other types of infrastructure such as data centers and cellular towers. Bandwidth infrastructure assets are a critical resource, connecting data centers, cellular towers and other carrier and private networks to support the substantial growth in global data, voice and video consumption by both business and individual consumers. Industry History
 Our industry has changed substantially over the years. The first phase of the bandwidth infrastructure industry occurred with the advent of the internet and the ensuing dot com era in the late 1990s. This led to the first major wave of fiber network deployments as a number of companies of varying backgrounds and profiles invested billions of dollars in fiber network construction throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe. These fiber network developers included companies with national and international plans (e.g., Level 3 Communications, Qwest Communications, Williams Communications) and more regional plans (e.g., 360networks, Progress Telecom, OnFiber). Following these network builds, many of the fiber companies struggled in the early 2000s due to the lack of sufficient demand for their high-bandwidth offerings. Bandwidth demand during this timeframe was limited by the fact that many bandwidth-intensive applications (e.g., streaming video, cloud, mobile broadband, big data analytics, etc.) were either not yet contemplated or still very early in their life cycle. Instead, the majority of traffic at the time was low-bandwidth offerings such as voice and dial-up modem connections. In addition, the similarity of the fiber routes deployed resulted in significant overcapacity and associated pricing pressure, leaving both a “last mile” gap and heavy competition and overcapacity along these routes. These two primary factors combined to significantly limit the fiber network providers’ operating cash 

 
  3
 
flows, resulting in the majority of these companies transitioning their business models, consolidating and/or seeking bankruptcy protection.
 In the following years, a substantial expansion in computing power and bandwidth-intensive applications drove meaningful bandwidth traffic growth. This growth highlighted the need to address the “last mile” gap by bringing bandwidth capacity directly to both the consumer and business end user. The capacity and performance of the consumer last mile connection was primarily addressed by the expansion of cable networks and through mobile network development by wireless carriers (supported by cellular tower operators). The growing bandwidth demand of business end users was addressed by a number of focused fiber developers constructing new networks to directly connect to data centers, cellular towers, government facilities, schools, hospitals and other locations with high-bandwidth needs. These fiber network companies were generally local or regional in nature and were most often either survivors of the initial fiber development wave, subsidiaries of a utility parent, or owned by entrepreneurs. This period is also noted for increased financial discipline following the large speculative capital deployments of the dot com era. This is the timeframe and industry environment in which our Company was founded.
 The Industry Today
 The acceleration in the development of bandwidth-intensive components and applications has resulted in a significant need to further fill in the “last mile” gap, leading to substantial capital investments in fiber networks by bandwidth infrastructure providers. Bandwidth infrastructure solutions support customer applications such as high-definition television broadcasting and video; online streaming video; cloud applications replacing in-house enterprise software platforms and explosive mobile data consumption. (Cisco found that mobile data traffic will increase sevenfold between 2017 and 2022). Companies whose services require large amounts of bandwidth and enterprises that consume large amounts of bandwidth are struggling to adapt to this rapidly evolving landscape and the bandwidth infrastructure industry is growing in economic importance as it addresses this critical need. In addition to these demand trends, there has been significant consolidation in the bandwidth infrastructure industry, validating a core tenet of our founding investment thesis. Since inception we have made 45 acquisitions in the U.S., Europe and Canada with an aggregate purchase consideration, net of cash acquired, totaling approximately $6.7 billion. Industry Participants
 We view the participants in today’s communications industry in two distinct categories:

· | Providers of Infrastructure. Companies that own and operate infrastructure assets that are used to market and deliver infrastructure offerings. We believe these assets would be difficult to replicate given the significant capital, time, permitting and expertise required. Providers of infrastructure typically enjoy long-term customer contracts, a highly visible and recurring revenue base and attractive margins. We further categorize these providers of infrastructure as follows: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Bandwidth Infrastructure Providers: Owners of bandwidth infrastructure assets comprised of fiber networks and interconnect-oriented colocation facilities. Bandwidth infrastructure offerings include dark fiber, lit fiber (Wavelengths, Ethernet, IP, and SONET) and colocation and interconnection offerings for the purpose of accommodating customers’ mission-critical traffic including data, voice, and video. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Data Center Providers: Owners of data center facilities that include raised floor, power and cooling infrastructure. These facilities house and support customer networking and computing equipment for carrier networks, enterprise cloud platforms, content distribution networks, and other mission-critical applications. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Cellular Tower Providers: Owners of cellular towers, the physical infrastructure upon which customer antennas and associated components are co-located for the wireless carrier industry. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
 
  4
 


· | Users of Infrastructure. Users of infrastructure may purchase infrastructure offerings either to provide value-added services to their customers or for their own private network requirements. We further categorize these users of infrastructure as follows: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Communications Service Providers. Communications service providers, such as wireless service providers, ILECs, CLECs and ISPs, are companies that use infrastructure to package, market, and sell value-added communications services such as voice, internet, data, video, wireless and hosting solutions. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | End Users. End users are public sector entities and private enterprises that use infrastructure for their own internal networks. Note that end users may also address their needs by purchasing value-added services from communications service providers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The Market Opportunity
 The proliferation of smart devices and mobile broadband, real-time streaming video, social networks, online gaming, machine-to-machine connectivity, big data analytics and cloud computing will continue to drive substantial demand for bandwidth infrastructure. Cisco estimates that mobile data traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 46% from 2017 to 2022 and that IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 26% from 2017 to 2022.
 Communications service providers develop and deliver value-added solutions that are tailored to mass market residential and enterprise customers whose needs continue to grow and evolve as bandwidth trends expand. Given this rapid growth and the complexity and cost of building and maintaining networks, communications service providers are increasingly looking to bandwidth infrastructure providers to augment the reach and performance of their own networks and support the delivery of the solutions their customers demand. As this dynamic continues, bandwidth infrastructure providers will become further entrenched as mission-critical partners to the communications service providers.
 Similarly, end users such as private enterprises (e.g., media/content providers, financial institutions and hospital systems) and public sector entities (e.g., governmental agencies and school districts) have experienced significant growth and change in the role that bandwidth infrastructure plays within their organizations. As these needs continue to grow in both volume and criticality, end users will increasingly choose to directly procure bandwidth infrastructure solutions in order to gain more security, control and scale in their internal network operations. An example of this disintermediation is the trend of large school districts, adapting to e-education requirements, directly procuring dark fiber access as a replacement to more value-added solutions. We believe that, as these dynamics play out across all industries, the number of end users directly seeking access to bandwidth infrastructure will continue to expand.
 By focusing on the reach, density and performance of their physical networks, bandwidth infrastructure providers can deliver customized offerings to communications service providers and end users more quickly and with superior economics than these users could otherwise self-provide. Whether providing fiber connectivity to a wireless carrier’s towers to enable mobile broadband, supplying a national communications service provider with a metro fiber footprint in new markets, providing a lit bandwidth connection to multiple enterprise data centers for an industrial company, providing interconnection capabilities to a hosting company within a data center, or solving for the next society-impacting innovation, bandwidth infrastructure providers will continue to invest in and expand their infrastructure assets to meet this growing demand.
 Given the natural economies of scale, there has been significant consolidation among bandwidth infrastructure providers, particularly in the U.S. We believe this consolidation trend will continue in the U.S. and is beginning in Europe and Canada. Combined with the barriers to new entrants, we foresee a decreasing number of bandwidth infrastructure providers against a backdrop of continued strong demand for their solutions.

 Our Bandwidth Infrastructure Assets
 Our bandwidth infrastructure assets consist of our fiber network (including the customer-accessed optronic components used to provide our lit offerings over our fiber network) and our data centers where we provide colocation and interconnection offerings. Our Fiber Network
 Our network footprint includes both large and small metro geographies, the extended suburban regions of many cities and the large rural, national and international fiber links that connect our metro network sections. We believe our network assets would be difficult to replicate given the geographic reach, network density and capital investment required. Our fiber network spans over 133,000 route miles and 13.0 million fiber miles (representing an average of 98 fibers per route), reaches approximately 400 geographic markets in the U.S., Canada and Europe and connects approximately 35,000 buildings, including 1,200 data centers.  Our network allows our customers access to our high-bandwidth infrastructure solutions over redundant fiber facilities between and among key customer locations. We believe the location and density of our expansive network footprint allow us to more competitively satisfy our target customers’ bandwidth infrastructure needs at the local, regional, national and international level relative to other regional bandwidth infrastructure solution providers or long-haul carriers. Our fiber network also has the following key attributes:
· | Extensive Coverage. Our fiber network sections are located across large and small metro geographies, as well as the extended metro and suburban regions of many cities and traverse large rural areas to connect metro markets. This network coverage allows us to address our target customers’ needs in a variety of geographies and for a variety of applications, all while remaining “on-net” and maintaining infrastructure economics. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Scalable Network Architecture. Our network is scalable, meaning we often have spare fiber, conduit access rights and/or rights of way that allow us to continue to add capacity to our network as our customers’ demand for our bandwidth infrastructure increases. In addition, the majority of our core fiber network segments utilize DWDM systems, nearly all of which have spare capacity through which we can continue to add dedicated Wavelengths to our network without consuming additional fiber. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Modern Fiber and Optronics. Our modern fiber network supports current generation optronic components including DWDM systems, carrier class Ethernet switches and IP routers. These customer-accessed components are used to provide our lit offerings. The vast majority of our network is capable of supporting next generation technologies with minimal capital investment. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Metro Fiber Network Sections.    We use our metro fiber network sections to provide access to bandwidth infrastructure within the metro markets where we operate. Our metro network sections are most commonly used in the following two scenarios: first, to provide connectivity between on-net buildings that are located in the same geographic market; second, to connect our on-net buildings within a metro market to another metro market via our regional and/or long-haul network sections. We continue to expand our metro fiber network sections within the metro geography and into the surrounding suburban areas as we extend to additional buildings to meet new demand on a success basis. Success-based expansion means that before we commit resources to expand our network, we have a signed customer contract that will provide us in most cases with an attractive return on required capital. In many of our metro markets, we have high-count fiber cables (sometimes as many as 864 fibers per cable) and in some cases multiple spare conduits on our metro fiber routes. On individual segments where our fiber capacity becomes highly utilized, we seek to augment that capacity also on a success basis.
 Regional and Long-haul Fiber Network Sections.    We use our regional fiber network sections to provide bandwidth infrastructure connectivity between the metro markets where we operate. Our regional and long-haul network sections are most commonly used in the following three scenarios: first, to provide connectivity between on-net buildings that are located in different large markets (for example, between Chicago and New York); second, to connect our on-net buildings in small and mid-sized markets back to major data centers, wireless switching centers and carrier hotels in larger markets (for example, between Lima, Ohio and Cleveland, Ohio); third, occasionally our network sections provide connectivity between on-net buildings in two different small or mid-sized markets located in various 

 
  6
 
parts of our regional network sections (for example, between Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Alexandria, Minnesota). We seek to continue to add new segments and markets to our regional and long-haul network sections on a success basis, supported by a customer contract. We have deployed current generation DWDM technologies across the majority of our regional and long-haul network sections, allowing a current maximum scaling to four terabytes (i.e. 4,000G) of bandwidth and the ability to add capacity as demand for bandwidth increases. We expect that as technology continues to advance, we will augment and invest in our regional and long-haul networks accordingly.
 Fiber-to-the-Tower Network Sections.We operate fiber-to-the-tower network sections across our fiber network footprint and connect to wireless macro and small cell sites. These FTT network sections provide our customers with access to bandwidth infrastructure that offers significantly improved speed, scale, performance and reliability levels relative to legacy copper and microwave networks. Our FTT network sections are scalable, which means we can quickly and easily increase the amount of bandwidth we provide to each of the towers as our customers’ wireless data networks grow. Our FTT markets are generally in areas where we already have dense fiber network sections (either metro or regional), which affords us the ability to offer access to ring-protected mobile infrastructure. We are increasingly providing dark fiber solutions on our FTT network sections.
 Through these fiber network sections, we provide connectivity to approximately 35,000 on-net buildings and are continually making success-based capital investments to increase our on-net building footprint. On-net buildings are buildings that are directly connected via fiber to our long-haul, regional, metro and FTT network sections. Our customers generally purchase our bandwidth infrastructure solutions so they can transport their data, internet, wireless and voice traffic between buildings directly connected to our network. The types of buildings connected to our network primarily consist of the following:

· | Data Centers, Carrier Hotels and Central Offices. These buildings house multiple users of bandwidth infrastructure, serving as telecommunications and content exchange points. Our fiber network generally connects the most important of these buildings in the markets where we operate. We have over 1,800 of these types of facilities connected to our network. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Single-Tenant, High-Bandwidth Locations. Generally, these are other telecom, media or internet content buildings that house a single large user of bandwidth infrastructure. Examples of these buildings include video aggregation sites, mobile switching centers and carrier POPs. Our network is connected to these buildings only when the tenant is a customer. We currently have over 4,000 single-tenant, high-bandwidth locations on-net. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cellular Towers. We connect to cellular towers and other locations that house wireless antennas. Typically, towers have multiple tenants, which provides us with the opportunity to provide our offerings to those additional tenants. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enterprise Buildings. Our network extends to over 21,000 enterprise buildings. This grouping contains a mix of single-tenant and multi-tenant enterprise buildings and includes hospitals, corporate data centers, schools, government buildings, research centers and other key corporate locations that require access to bandwidth infrastructure. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our Data Centers
 Many of our data center facilities are located in some of the most important carrier hotels in North America, including 60 Hudson Street and 111 8th Avenue in New York; 165 Halsey Street in Newark; 401 N. Broad Street in Philadelphia; 1 Summer Street in Boston; 1950 N. Stemmons Freeway and 2323 Bryan Street in Dallas; 2001 6th Street in Seattle and 151 Front Street in Toronto. We have the exclusive right to operate and provide colocation and interconnection offerings in the Meet-Me Room at 60 Hudson Street. We also have colocation facilities located in Atlanta, Ashburn, Austin, Amsterdam, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, McLean, Memphis, Miami, Minneapolis, Montreal, Nashville, Paris, Phoenix, San Diego, Santa Clara, Toronto and four additional locations in Europe. All of our facilities are network-neutral and have ample power to meet customer needs, backup power in the form of batteries and generators, air conditioning, modern fire suppression technology, 24/7 security monitoring and 

 
  7
 
redundant cooling capabilities. We have long-term leases with the owners of each of the buildings where we provide colocation offerings. Our colocation facilities total approximately 1 million square feet of billable colocation space.
 Underlying Rights
 We have the necessary right-of-way agreements and other required rights, including state and federal government authorization, to allow us to maintain and expand our fiber network sections that are located on private property and public rights-of-way, including utility poles. When we expand our network, we obtain the necessary construction permits, license agreements, permits and franchise agreements. Certain of these permits, licenses and franchises are for a limited duration. When we need to use private property, our strategy is to obtain rights-of-way under long-term contracts. Our Segments and Offerings
 We provide high-bandwidth infrastructure products and solutions over our extensive metro, regional and long-haul fiber networks sections and through our interconnect-oriented data center facilities. We provide our products and solutions through our four operating segments: Zayo Networks, Zayo Colocation (zColo), Allstream and Other. Across our segments, we operate individual Strategic Product Groups (“SPGs”). Each SPG has financial accountability and decision-making authority, which promotes agility in the fast-moving markets where we operate. Financial information for each of our operating segments and our domestic and foreign operations is contained in Note 17 – Segment Reporting to our consolidated financial statements.
 During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, with the continued increase in our scope and scale, our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is our Chief Executive Officer, implemented certain organizational changes to the management and operation of the business that directly impact how the CODM makes resource allocation decisions and manages the Company. The changes in structure had the impact of combining our legacy Fiber Solutions, Transport and Enterprise segments into a single new segment, Zayo Networks and re-aligning our Cloud and Cybersecurity SPG from our legacy Enterprise segment to our zColo segment. These changes to our existing reportable segments have been recast for all prior period financial and operating metrics presented in this Annual Report for comparability.
  Zayo Networks.  Our Zayo Networks segment provides access to bandwidth infrastructure. For purposes of this discussion, we have classified the Zayo Networks SPGs into the following categories: Fiber, Transport and Layer 2/3 solutions. In the Fiber business, we lease dedicated fiber pairs to our customers; in our Transport business, we sell lit fiber-based solutions that are point to point in nature and in our Layer 2/3 business we sell lit fiber-based solutions to medium and large enterprises that may be multi-point or encompass a higher service level.
 In our Fiber line of business, we lease dedicated fiber pairs (usually 2 to 12 total fibers) to our customers who often “light” the fiber using their own optronics. Dark fiber is a physically separate and secure, private platform for dedicated bandwidth and is used by sophisticated customers to build out their network connectivity. Within the Fiber business, Zayo provides access to mobile infrastructure (fiber-to-the-tower and small cell). Our mobile infrastructure solutions permit direct fiber connections to cell towers, small cells, hub sites and mobile switching centers. Fiber solutions customers include carriers and other communication service providers, internet service providers, wireless service providers, major media and content companies, large enterprises and other companies that have the expertise to run their own fiber optic networks or require interconnected technical space. The contract terms for fiber solutions customers tend to range from three to twenty or more years.
 Our Transport line of business provides access to lit communications bandwidth infrastructure using customer-accessed optronics to light the fiber and, and our customers pay for access based on the amount and type of bandwidth they require.  We target customers who require a significant amount of bandwidth across their networks. Transport customers include carriers, content providers, financial services companies, healthcare, government entities, education institutions and other medium and large enterprises. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years.  Our two transport solution SPGs are described below:

· | Zayo Wavelength (“Waves”) Offerings. Through our Waves SPG, we provide access to lit communications bandwidth infrastructure to our customers by deploying optical Wavelength technology. The offerings are provided by using DWDM optronic components to “multiplex” multiple channels (i.e., 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  8
 

Wavelengths) of dedicated capacity on a single fiber pair. Access capacity is provided at speeds of 1G, 2.5G, 10G, 40G and, and 100G. Customers include carriers, financial services companies, major media and content companies, healthcare, government institutions, education institutions and other enterprises. The contract terms for Wavelength offerings are typically between one and five years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and in some cases an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Zayo SONET Offerings. Through our SONET SPG, we provide access to lit communications bandwidth infrastructure to our customers by deploying SONET technology. SONET is a standardized time-division protocol that transfers multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. SONET technology is often used to support private line technology. This protocol enables movement of voice, data and video at high speeds. SONET network sections are protected, which provides for virtually instantaneous restoration of connectivity in the event of a fiber cut or component failure. Access capacity is provided at speeds ranging from DS-1 (1.54Mb) to OC-192 (10G). Customers in this group are largely carriers. The contract terms for SONET offerings typically range between one and five years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and in some cases an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. SONET is generally a legacy product that is gradually being replaced by Ethernet, Wavelength and dark fiber solutions. As a result, the SONET SPG generally manages its business to maximize cash generation and deploys minimal growth capital.

· | Zayo IP Transit Offerings. Through our IP Transit SPG, we provide access to lit bandwidth infrastructure to our customers by deploying Internet Protocol technology. IP technology permits the flow of data across multiple circuits over a shared infrastructure from the customer source to the customer required destination. Information leaving the source is divided into multiple packets and each packet traverses the network utilizing the most efficient path and means available, as determined by a network of IP routers. Packets of information may utilize different physical circuits or paths in order to reach the destination, at which point the packets are reassembled to form the complete communication. The offerings are generally used to exchange communication on or access the public internet. Access capacity is provided at speeds ranging from 10Mb to 100G on a single customer port interface. Customers include regional and international telecommunications and cable carriers, ISPs, enterprises, educational institutions and content companies. The contract terms for IP offerings typically range between one and three years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and in some cases a usage-based and/or an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. Pricing is generally a function of bandwidth capacity and the access required to accommodate traffic from the customer location to a public internet exchange.

 Our Operations
 Network Management and Operations
 Our primary network operating center (“NOC”) is located in Tulsa, Oklahoma and provides 24 hours per day, 365 days per year monitoring and network surveillance. As part of our business continuity plan, our primary NOC is backed up by several regional operations centers located in Washington, D.C., Allentown, Pennsylvania and Butte, Montana. We continually monitor for, and proactively respond to, any events that negatively impact or interrupt the network access and services we provide to our customers. Our NOC also responds to customer network inquiries via standard customer trouble ticket procedures. Our NOC coordinates and notifies our customers of maintenance activities and is the organization responsible for ensuring we meet our access and service level agreements. Information Technology
 Our Information Technology systems have been designed and built specifically for the needs of a focused bandwidth infrastructure provider primarily leveraging the salesforce.com platform. This platform was adopted at our inception and has been enhanced over time to integrate all of our acquired companies and increase functionality in every area.

 
  10
 

 Our current systems’ capability is mature and we view our application functionality as a competitive advantage in our industry. Our system is differentiated from the typical telecom industry technology solution consisting of separate and loosely integrated sales force automation, customer relationship management, mapping, inventory, financial, provisioning and other systems with multiple, sometimes conflicting databases.
 We have also developed within our salesforce.com platform a proprietary capability we call Tranzact. Tranzact is a set of tools and processes designed to enhance the speed and simplicity of procuring bandwidth infrastructure solutions. We believe Tranzact will further increase our competitive advantage in delivering bandwidth infrastructure solutions.
 We have a fully implemented business continuity and disaster recovery plan that provides near real-time data access from physically diverse data centers (Dallas and Washington, D.C.). We further protect our data with off-site data storage practices.
 Our Sales and Marketing Organization 
 Our business primarily engages in direct sales through our sales organization, consisting of 312 sales representatives as of June 30, 2019. Each of these sales representatives is part of an enterprise or carrier focused sales team led by a sales director whose team is responsible for meeting a set of quarterly net install booking targets. The sales organization sells access and services across all our SPGs. The sales representatives are directly supported by sales management, engineering, solutions engineering and marketing staff.
 The sales organization is organized into five “Mega-Vertical” sectors; Finance & Professional Services, Media Content & Commerce, Public Sector Health & Utilities, Cloud Software & Infrastructure and Carrier. Each of these channels maintains dedicated sales and solutions engineering support resources. We derive revenues from these sectors using a mix of Direct Sales, Inside Sales and Indirect Channels Partners. These sales channels operate across the US, Canada and Europe, with occasional customer visits to Asia and Central / South America.
 Our direct sales force is compensated through a unique system relative to typical industry practices. Sales staff are compensated through salary and incentive compensation, which is comprised of cash and equity.  Incentive compensation is achieved based upon the net present value (“NPV”) of the contracted access and services sold, the incremental revenue related to contracted access and services sold and the effective management of churn related to the accounts they manage. We believe this compensation system best aligns the interests of our salespeople, management and our stockholders. It also is an example of the financial philosophy and culture we have developed since our inception.
 Separate from the sales groups, we have a Strategic Marketing group that is responsible for our digital programs and presence, field marketing and vertical strategy. Vertical strategy leads are dedicated to supporting each “Mega Vertical” and focus on understanding key trends, marketplace dynamics and articulating back to the business how we can best serve our customers communications infrastructure needs. 
 Our Customers
 Our customers generally have a significant and growing need for the bandwidth infrastructure solutions that we offer. Our customer base consists of wireless service providers, carriers and other communication service providers, media and content companies (including cable and satellite video providers) and other bandwidth-intensive businesses in the education, healthcare, financial services, governmental and technology sectors. Our largest single customer, based on recurring revenue, accounted for approximately 8% of our revenue during the year ended June 30, 2019 and total revenues from our top ten customers accounted for approximately 29% of our revenue during the same period. These customers are multinational organizations with substantial liquidity and access to capital and whose bandwidth needs are mission-critical to their own businesses and strategies. While these large customers generally have a finite set of master contracts with us, they procure a large volume of individual access rights and services from us, each of which has its own access and service level agreement and term.
 The majority of our customers sign Master Customer Agreements (“MCAs”) that contain standard terms and conditions including access and service level agreements, required response intervals, indemnification, default, force 

 
  11
 
majeure, assignment and notification, limitation of liability, confidentiality and other key terms and conditions. Most MCAs also contain appendices that contain information that is specific to each of the access rights and services that we provide. The MCAs either have exhibits that contain customer orders or, alternatively, the terms for access and services ordered are set forth in a separate customer order. Each customer order sets forth the minimum contract duration, the monthly recurring charge and the non-recurring charges.
 Our Business Strategy
 In pursuit of our mission, our Business Strategy includes the following key elements:

· | Focus on Bandwidth Infrastructure. We expect bandwidth needs for mobile applications, cloud-based computing and machine-to-machine connectivity will continue to grow with the continued adoption of bandwidth-intensive devices, as well as the escalating demand for internet-delivered video. We focus on providing high-bandwidth infrastructure solutions, which we believe are essential in the consumption and delivery of bandwidth-intensive applications and services by our customers, enterprise customers and communications service providers. We believe our disciplined approach to providing these critical access rights and to our targeted customers enables us to offer a high level of customer satisfaction, while at the same time being responsive to changes in the marketplace. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Target Large Consumers of Bandwidth. Our asset base and product suite are geared for large users of bandwidth with high connectivity requirements. The majority of our customers require more than 10G of bandwidth; many of our customers require multiple terabytes of bandwidth. Our revenue base is generally characterized by customers with a high bandwidth spend, consisting of a large number of individual access rights and services and increasing bandwidth infrastructure access and service demand. Tailoring our operations around these offerings, services and customers allows us to operate efficiently and meet these large consumers’ requirements for mission-critical infrastructure. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage Our Extensive Asset Base by Selling Offerings on Our Network. Targeting our sales efforts to solutions that utilize our existing fiber network and data centers enables us to limit our reliance on third-party providers. We believe this in turn produces high incremental margins, which helps us expand consolidated margins, achieve attractive returns on the capital we invest and realize significant levered free cash flow. We also believe this enables us to provide our customers with a superior level of customer satisfaction due to the relative ease in responding to customer inquiries over our one contiguous fiber network. Our existing network enables us to offer additional bandwidth access to our existing customers as their capacity needs grow. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to Expand Our Infrastructure Assets. Our ability to rapidly add network capacity to meet the growing requirements of our customers is an important component of our value proposition. We will continue to seek opportunities to expand our network reach where supporting customer contracts provide an attractive return on our investment. The expansion of our network footprint also provides the ancillary benefit of bringing other potential customer locations within reach. We design our network with additional capacity so that increasing bandwidth capacity can be deployed economically and efficiently. Capital expenditures are primarily success-based. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage Our Existing Relationships and Assets to Innovate. We believe we possess a unique set of assets and management systems designed to deliver customer solutions tailored to specific trends we observe in the marketplace. Our high-energy, entrepreneurial culture fosters employee innovation on an ongoing basis in response to specific customer requirements. Furthermore, we plan to continue to commit capital to new lines of infrastructure businesses that leverage our existing assets. For example, we are expanding into small cell infrastructure solutions provided to wireless services providers. These solutions entail us providing dark fiber and related offerings from a small cell location back to a mobile switching center. We provide access for the fiber-based transport over our existing and/or newly constructed fiber network sections. In addition, we provide network-neutral space and power for wireless service providers to co-locate their small cell antennas and ancillary equipment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  12
 

    
· | Intelligently Expand Through Acquisitions. We have made 45 acquisitions to date for an aggregate purchase price, net of cash, of $6.7 billion. We believe we have consistently demonstrated an ability to acquire and effectively integrate companies, realize cost synergies and organically grow revenue post-acquisition. Acquisitions have the ability to increase the scale of our operations, which in turn affords us the ability to expand our operating leverage, extend our network reach and broaden our customer base. We believe our ability to realize significant cost synergies through acquisitions provides us with a competitive advantage in future consolidation opportunities within our industry. We will continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities and are regularly involved in acquisition discussions. We will evaluate these opportunities based on a number of criteria, including expected return on capital, the quality of the infrastructure assets, the fit within our existing businesses, the opportunity to expand our network and the opportunity to create value through the realization of cost synergies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe the following are among our core competitive strengths and enable us to differentiate ourselves in the markets where we operate:

· | Unique Bandwidth Infrastructure Assets. We believe replicating our extensive metro, regional and long-haul fiber assets would be difficult given the significant capital, time, permitting and expertise required. Our fiber spans 133,000 route miles and 13.0 million fiber miles (representing an average of 400 geographic markets in the United States, Canada and Europe) and connects to approximately 35,000 buildings. The majority of the markets that we serve and buildings to which we connect have few other networks capable of providing similar high-bandwidth infrastructure and connectivity solutions. This capability provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage in these markets and positions us as a mission-critical infrastructure supplier to the largest users of bandwidth. We believe the vast majority of customers using our network, including our lit bandwidth, fiber-to-the-tower and dark fiber customers, choose our offerings due to the quality and reach of our network and the ability our network gives us to innovate and scale with their growing bandwidth needs. Additionally, we operate 51 data center facilities, which are located in some of the most important carrier hotels in the U.S., Canada and France. This collective presence, combined with our high network density, creates a network effect that helps us retain existing customers and attract new customers. From July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2019, exclusive of acquisitions, we have invested approximately $2.4 billion of capital in our network, including expansion and maintenance expenditures. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong Revenue Growth, Visibility, and Durability. We have consistently grown our organic revenue, as gross installed revenue has exceeded churn processed in every quarter since we began reporting in March 2010. We believe our exposure to the enduring trend of increasing bandwidth consumption combined with our focused execution have allowed us to achieve this consistent growth. We typically provide access to our bandwidth infrastructure for a fixed monthly recurring fee under multi-year contracts. Our contract terms range from one year to 20 or more years. Our customers use our bandwidth infrastructure to support their mission-critical networks and applications. The switching costs and effort required to replace our solutions can be high, particularly for the solutions within our Zayo Networks segment, given the criticality of our solutions and the potential cost and disruption. We believe increasing bandwidth needs combined with the mission-critical nature of our infrastructure-based solutions provided under multi-year contracts create strong revenue growth, visibility and durability, which support our decision-making abilities and financial stability. We believe our industry’s high barriers to entry, our economies of scale and scope and customer switching costs contribute to our strong financial performance. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Customer Service and Ability to Innovate for Our Customers. Our sales and product professionals work closely with potential and existing customers to design tailored high-bandwidth connectivity solutions across our SPGs to meet specific, varying and evolving customer needs. We are focused on delivering high-quality, reliable access to our customers. We achieve this by leveraging our contiguous network to expand with our customers as they seek to build scale, coverage and/or performance. Additionally, our 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  13
 

focus on targeting the largest and most sophisticated users of bandwidth keeps our sales, engineering and customer satisfaction organizations attuned to the latest technologies, architectures and solutions that our customers may seek to implement. We believe our willingness to innovate for our customers and our dedication to customer satisfaction help establish our position as an important infrastructure supplier and allow us to attract new customers and businesses, sell an increasing amount of access rights and services to our existing customers and reduce customer turnover.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strategic, Operational and Financial Transparency Excellence. As part of our strategy to attract and retain the largest users of bandwidth infrastructure, we have completed and integrated 45 acquisitions to date. Our acquired assets have been combined to create a contiguous network with the ability to provision and maintain local, regional, national, or international high-bandwidth connections across our SPGs. Our entire network, sales and churn activity, installation pipeline, NPV commission plans and all customer contracts are managed through an integrated operating and reporting platform, which gives management strong visibility into the business and improves our ability to drive return-maximizing decisions throughout the organization. Our focus on operational and financial transparency not only allows us to be very nimble in attacking various market opportunities, but also provides us the ability to deliver disclosure that our stockholders and other stakeholders can use to accurately judge management’s performance from a capital allocation, financial and operational perspective. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Financially Focused and Entrepreneurial Culture. Virtually all operational and financial decisions we make are driven by the standard of maximizing the value of our enterprise. Our sales commission plans incorporate an NPV-based approach alongside measures of absolute sales with the goal of encouraging the proper behavior within our sales force and our SPGs are held to group level equity internal rate of return (“IRR”) targets set by management. To align individual behaviors with stockholder objectives, equity compensation is used throughout the Company and our compensation plans include a larger equity component than we believe is standard in our industry. In addition to striving for industry-leading operational and growth outcomes to drive value creation, we are prepared to use debt capacity to enhance stockholder returns, but not at the expense of other stakeholders and only at levels we believe are in the long-term interests of the Company, our customers and our stockholders. Finally, our owners’ manual, mission and investor transparency all serve to enhance cultural alignment across the Company and our stockholders. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Experienced Management with Unique Leadership Approach. We have assembled an experienced management team we believe is well-qualified to lead our Company and execute our strategy. Our management team has substantial industry experience in managing and designing fiber network and network-neutral colocation and interconnection facilities and in selling and marketing bandwidth infrastructure. In addition, our management team has significant experience in acquiring and integrating bandwidth infrastructure and assets. Our management team is a cohesive unit with a common history that in many cases precedes the Company’s founding. We also believe our approach to leadership - operationally, financially, culturally - is unique in our industry and differentiates us from our competitors.

      Our Competition
 Zayo Networks 
 Given the requirement to own the underlying bandwidth infrastructure assets in order to provide infrastructure solutions, the competitive environment tends to be less intensive for these products and the barriers to entry are high. The degree of competition and parties in competition vary by physical infrastructure and by individual market and line of business: Fiber, Transport, and Layer 2/3.

 
  14
 

 Fiber
 Competition in dark fiber solutions tends to be less intense than for lit bandwidth infrastructure solutions primarily because a provider must predominantly own and operate a high count fiber network covering a substantial portion of the geographical demand in order to compete for a customer’s business. The uniqueness, density and depth (i.e., high fiber count) of our metro, regional and long-haul fiber network sections is therefore a key differentiating factor. In addition, given that providing dark fiber solutions often includes some degree of network expansion, dark fiber providers must also have internal project management expertise and access to capital to execute on the expansion aspect of the business. Due to the custom nature of most dark fiber opportunities, many larger lit bandwidth infrastructure providers do not actively market dark fiber as a product, even if they own fiber networks in the desired geographies. As a result, competition is often more limited in the dark fiber market and highly dependent on the local (even sub-market) supply and demand environment. Given this dynamic and the generally longer contractual term of dark fiber solutions, dark fiber pricing tends to be more inflationary in nature.
 Specific dark fiber competitors vary based on geography and often a particular solution can be provided by only one to three providers that have sufficient fiber in place in the desired area or route. Historically, these competitors have fallen into two categories: first, privately owned regional bandwidth infrastructure providers with a similar degree of focus (e.g., Fiber Light) and second, single market dark fiber providers with market and fiber construction expertise (e.g., DQE Communications and Edison Carrier Solutions). More recently, other multi-geography competitors have emerged due to acquisitions in the industry (e.g., Crown Castle and Uniti).
 Transport
     We believe some of the key factors that influence our customers’ selection of us as their Transport solution provider are our ability to provide on-net solutions that utilize our fiber network on an end-to-end basis, the availability of high capacity offerings (up to 100G or higher as optical technology advances), the uniqueness, quantity and latency of available intercity and metro routes, the peering capacity and reach of our IP network, the price of the offerings available and the ongoing level of network availability provided.
 Generally, price competition for our transport solutions varies depending on the location of the customer’s selected endpoints and the uniqueness of network assets. We face direct price competition when there are other fiber-based providers who have intercity networks that leverage similar fiber routes with similar end to end route latency. Often a particular solution can be provided by only one to three providers that have comparable network reach in place. Typically, these competitors are publicly traded communications service providers that also provide bandwidth infrastructure such as Windstream, Telia Company, or Cogent Communications, or in certain geographies are privately-held companies such as EU Networks. We may also compete with large, well-capitalized ILECs that provide bandwidth infrastructure, such as AT&T Inc. and CenturyLink, Inc., who have a well established and global IP offering. We believe price competition will continue where our competitors have comparable existing fiber and optical networks. Some of our competitors have long-standing customer relationships, very large enterprise values and significant access to capital.
 Layer 2/3
 Layer 2/3 focuses on offering network connectivity to large multi-site enterprises. The competition is intense and varied for the enterprise IT business and the specific competitors are based on each of the offering categories and geographies. Our key challenges range from aggressive pricing to an evolving competitive field with the completion of each new merger or acquisition.
 From a network connectivity perspective, our Layer 2/3 competitors range from well capitalized ILECs that also provide bandwidth infrastructure, such as AT&T Inc., CenturyLink, Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., or publicly traded communications service providers that also provide bandwidth infrastructure, such as Cogent and Windstream. In some geographies, we also compete with Crown Castle, GTT and Comcast.
  Many of our competitors in the Layer 2/3 market are well established with long-standing relationships and we must compete in a variety of aspects as Layer 2/3 IT customers are tech savvy and well informed. As an example, purchasers of network solutions generally base their decisions on the best value, which includes price, route (diversity 

 
  15
 
and latency), flexibility and customer satisfaction responsiveness. Two of our key competitive challenges are brand recognition and product set awareness. However, we believe we are very competitive when we can communicate our capabilities that include our dense, global fiber network, our ability to implement complex and unique solutions and our focus on customer satisfaction at a price that meets the customer’s budget. With Layer 2/3, we believe we can aggressively compete with the short list of single source global providers.
 zColo
 The market for our colocation, interconnection, cloud and cybersecurity offerings is very competitive. We compete based on location, availability, quality of facility infrastructure, network carrier density, breadth of network connectivity options, type and quantity of customers in our data centers and the overall geographic reach of our platform. We compete against both public colocation providers who have large enterprise values and privately-held colocation providers who are well funded. Some of our competitors have long-standing customer relationships and significant access to capital, which may enable them to materially increase available data center space and therefore lower overall market pricing for such solutions. A portion of our competitors operate at larger scale in the same markets as us; others compete cross regionally attracting a customer base that values and requires global reach and scale. We differentiate from our competitors by providing our customers with on-net access to our robust fiber network and by allowing spend portability between our entire portfolio of communications infrastructure solutions as their needs change.
 These focused interconnection and colocation providers include Equinix, ‎Coresite, Cologix, Flexential, Digital Realty Trust and QTS Realty Trust. These companies offer similar solutions and operate in similar markets to us. Our ability to compete is based on the strategic location of our assets, a highly complementary global fiber network, an aptitude for commercial flexibility in contracts and a competency in the implementation of colocation and interconnection offerings.
 For cloud services our competition also varies depending on the type of service. For example, we compete with Dell EMC, HPE and NetApp in the Private Cloud market but we compete with AWS, Rackspace and smaller cloud service providers for Object-Based Storage business. In the area of cybersecurity, the competitive field is vast and specialized and will vary depending on the specific security need ranging from infrastructure security, endpoint security, application security, managed security to threat analysis and protection, Internet of Things and data security.
 Allstream
 Allstream serves business customers throughout the United States and Canada. Its communications technologies and services include a range of scalable IP, cloud, voice and data solutions that help organizations communicate and collaborate more efficiently and profitably. Our largest competitors in Canada are the incumbent telecommunications companies Bell, TELUS and Rogers. Our largest U.S. competitors are CenturyLink, Verizon, Comcast, Cox and Ring Central. We also compete with other telecommunications companies, such as established cable and hydro companies and smaller companies or re-sellers that have a more limited network.     Regulatory Matters
 Our operations require that certain of our subsidiaries hold licenses, certificates and/or other regulatory authorizations from the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), state Public Utilities Commissions (“PUCs”), European and Canadian telecommunications regulators (such as, Ofcom and ARCEP in Europe and CRTC in Canada) and other foreign regulators, all of which we have obtained and maintain in the normal course of our business. The FCC, State PUCs and foreign regulators generally have the power to modify or terminate a carrier’s authority to provide regulated wireline offerings for failure to comply with certain federal, state and foreign laws and regulations and may impose fines or other penalties for violations of the same. The State PUCs typically have similar powers with respect to the intrastate offerings that we provide under their jurisdiction. In addition, we are required to submit periodic reports to the FCC, State PUCs and foreign regulators documenting interstate, intrastate and foreign revenue, among other data, for fee assessments and general regulatory governance and in some states are required to file tariffs of our rates, terms and conditions of access and service. In order to engage in certain transactions in these jurisdictions, including changes of control, the encumbrance of certain assets, the issuance of securities, the incurrence of indebtedness, the guarantee of 

 
  16
 
indebtedness of other entities, including subsidiaries of ours and the transfer of our assets, we are required to provide notice and/or obtain prior approval from certain of these governmental agencies. The construction of additions to our current fiber network is also subject to certain governmental permitting and licensing requirements.
 In addition, our business is subject to various other regulations at the federal, state, local and international levels. These regulations affect the way we can conduct our business and our costs of doing so. However, we believe, based on our examination of such existing and potential new regulations being considered in ongoing FCC and State PUC and European, Canadian and other foreign governmental proceedings, that such regulations will not have a significant impact on us.

 On May 3, 2018, we announced we completed the first phase of our investigation on the advisability and feasibility of a conversion to a real estate investment trust for U.S federal income tax purposes (a “REIT”).  As part of the current phase of our evaluation and preparation for a potential conversion to a REIT, we began a direct dialogue with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) in an effort to obtain clarity and support for our position, and we are seeking a private letter ruling (“PLR”) from the IRS that addresses among other things, whether our revenues from dark and lit fiber satisfy applicable REIT income tests.  We submitted the PLR request to the IRS in July 2018, but the IRS may not provide a response until later in 2019 or beyond or may not respond at all.  Our ultimate decision to convert to a REIT may depend upon a favorable PLR from the IRS. 
 Also, we have begun to execute various organizational changes that are required to operate as a REIT, including the adoption of amendments to our organizational documents that, among other things, impose certain stock ownership limitations and transfer restrictions, the realignment of our business segments to clearly delineate the leasing of network assets from ancillary services and, in particular, the separation and potential divestiture or deconsolidation of our Allstream business segment. These organizational changes are not expected to result in any changes to our reportable segments.
 If, following the current phase of our evaluation and preparation, we decide to convert to a REIT and are successful in qualifying for taxation as a REIT, then we will generally be permitted to deduct from federal income taxes the dividends that we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends would not be subject to federal income taxation at the entity level but would be taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (each, a “TRS”), which will hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT-compliant, will be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries will continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through entities that are disregarded from us for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Also, we will be subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized during a specified period (generally five years) following the REIT conversion that are attributable to “built-in” gains with respect to the assets that we own on the date we convert to a REIT.
 Our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT will depend upon our compliance with various requirements following our REIT conversion, including requirements related to the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the distributions to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate income tax rates in the same manner as we are currently taxed. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs described above, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all.
 At this stage of our evaluation and preparation for a potential conversion to a REIT, we cannot accurately estimate the costs required to support any potential conversion, but we anticipate that our costs would include various administrative costs in addition to certain related tax liabilities.
