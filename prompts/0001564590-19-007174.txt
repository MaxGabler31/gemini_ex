ITEM 1.BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 Fauquier Bankshares, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia on January 13, 1984. The Company is a registered bank holding company and owns all of the voting shares of The Fauquier Bank (the “Bank”). The Company engages in its business through the Bank, a Virginia state-chartered bank that commenced operations in 1902. The Company has no significant operations other than owning the stock of the Bank.
THE FAUQUIER BANK
 The Bank’s general market area principally includes Fauquier County, Prince William County and neighboring communities, and is located approximately 50 miles southwest of Washington, D.C. The Bank provides a full range of financial services, including internet banking, mobile banking, commercial, retail, insurance, wealth management, and financial planning services through eleven banking offices throughout Fauquier and Prince William counties in Virginia.
 
The Bank provides retail banking services to individuals and businesses. These services include various types of interest and noninterest-bearing checking accounts, money market and savings accounts, and time deposits.  In addition, the Bank provides secured and unsecured commercial and real estate loans, standby letters of credit, secured and unsecured lines of credit, personal loans, residential mortgages and home equity loans, automobile and other types of consumer financing. 
 
The Bank operates a Wealth Management Services (“WMS” or “Wealth Management”) division that began with the granting of trust powers to the Bank in 1919. The WMS division offers a full range of personalized services that include investment management, financial planning, trust, estate settlement, retirement, insurance and brokerage services.   
 
The Bank, through its subsidiary Fauquier Bank Services, Inc., has equity ownership interests in Bankers Insurance, LLC, a Virginia independent insurance company, and Bankers Title Shenandoah, LLC, a title insurance company which are owned by a consortium of Virginia community banks.  Fauquier Bank Services, Inc. also, previously had an equity ownership interest in Infinex Investments, Inc., a full service broker/dealer, owned by banks and banking associations in various states, whose ownership was sold by Fauquier Bank Services, Inc. in January 2019.
 
The revenues of the Bank are primarily derived from interest on, and fees received in connection with, real estate and other loans, and from interest and dividends from investment securities.  The principal sources of funds for the Bank’s lending activities are its deposits, repayment of loans, the sale and maturity of investment securities, and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”). Additional revenues are derived from fees for deposit and WMS related services. 
 
LENDING ACTIVITIES
 The Bank offers a range of lending services, including real estate and commercial loans, to individuals, as well as, small-to-medium sized businesses and other organizations that are located in or conduct a substantial portion of their business in the Bank’s market area. The majority of the Bank’s loans are made on a secured basis. The interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity, and amount of the loan, and are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, availability of funds and government regulations. The Bank has no foreign loans, subprime loans or loans for highly leveraged transactions.
 
The Bank’s general market area for lending consists of Fauquier and Prince William Counties, Virginia and the neighboring communities. There is no assurance that this area will experience economic growth. Deteriorating economic conditions in Fauquier or Prince William Counties, as well as declines in the market value of local commercial and/or residential real estate may have an adverse effect on the Company and the Bank.
 
The Bank’s loan portfolio includes the following segments: commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and land loans, consumer and student loans, residential real estate loans and home equity lines of credit.  
 
COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS
 The Bank’s commercial loans include loans for working capital, equipment purchases, and various other business purposes. Business assets are the primary collateral for the Bank’s commercial loan portfolio.  Commercial loans have variable or fixed rates of interest. 
 2


Commercial lines of credit are typically granted on a one-year basis. Other commercial loans with terms or amortization schedules longer than one year will normally carry interest rates that vary based on financial indices and will be payable in full in three to five years.
 
Loan originations are derived from a number of sources, including existing customers and borrowers, walk-in customers, advertising, and direct solicitation by the Bank’s loan officers. Certain credit risks are inherent in originating and keeping loans on the Bank’s balance sheet. These include interest rate and prepayment risks, risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral and changes in economic and industry conditions.  In particular, longer maturities increase the risk that economic conditions will change and adversely affect the Bank's ability to collect. The Bank attempts to minimize loan losses through various means, including the debtors’ cash flow as the source of repayment and secondarily the value of the underlying collateral. In addition, the Bank attempts to utilize shorter loan terms in order to reduce the risk of a decline in the value of such collateral. 
 
COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS
 Loans secured by commercial real estate consist principally of commercial loans for which real estate constitutes the primary source of collateral. Commercial real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of risk than single-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of commercial real estate loans may be more vulnerable to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.
CONSTRUCTION AND LAND LOANS
 The majority of the Bank’s construction and land loans are made to individuals to construct a primary residence. Such loans have a maximum term of twelve months, a fixed rate of interest, and loan-to-value ratios of 80% or less of the appraised value upon completion. The Bank requires that permanent financing, with the Bank or some other lender, be in place prior to closing any construction loan. Construction loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than single-family residential mortgage loans. The risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion. The Bank also provides construction loans and lines of credit to developers. Such loans generally have maximum loan-to-value ratios of 80% of the appraised value upon completion. The loans are made with a fixed rate of interest. The majority of these construction loans are made to selected local developers for the building of single-family dwellings on either a pre-sold or speculative basis. The Bank limits the number of unsold units under construction at one time. Loan proceeds are disbursed in stages after inspections of the project indicate that such disbursements are for costs already incurred and that have added to the value of the project. Construction loans include loans to developers to acquire the necessary land, develop the site and construct the residential units. 
CONSUMER AND STUDENT LOANS
 The Bank’s consumer loans include loans to individuals such as auto loans, credit card loans and overdraft loans. The Bank also has U.S. Government guaranteed student loans, which were purchased through and serviced by a third-party and have a variable rate of interest. 
RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS
 The Bank’s 1-4 family residential real estate loan portfolio primarily consists of conventional loans, generally with fixed interest rates with 15 or 30-year terms, and balloon loans with fixed interest rates, and 3, 5, 7, or 10 year maturities utilizing amortization schedules of 30 years or less. The majority of the Bank’s 1-4 family residential mortgage loans are secured by properties located in the Bank’s market area.
HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT
 The Bank’s home equity lines of credit consist of conventional loans, generally with variable interest rates that are tied to the Wall Street Journal prime rate with 10 year terms. The majority of the Bank’s home equity lines of credit are secured by properties located in the Bank’s market area. The Bank allows a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 85% of the value of the property held as collateral at the time of origination.
DEPOSIT ACTIVITIES
 Deposits are the major source of the Bank’s funds for lending and other investment activities. The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).  The Bank considers its interest and noninterest-bearing checking accounts, savings and money market accounts, and nonbrokered time deposits under $100,000 to be core deposits.  Generally, the Bank attempts to maintain the rates paid on its deposits at a competitive level.  The Bank is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) and Insured Cash Sweep Service (“ICS”), to provide customers multi-million dollar FDIC insurance on certificate of deposit investments and deposit sweeps through the transfer and/or exchange with other FDIC insured institutions. CDARS and ICS are registered service marks of Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC.  
 3


INVESTMENTS
 The Bank invests a portion of its assets in U.S. Government-sponsored corporation and agency obligations, state, county and municipal obligations, corporate obligations, and mutual funds. The Bank’s investments are managed in relation to loan demand and deposit growth, and are generally used to provide for the investment of excess funds at reduced yields and risks relative to yields and risks of the loan portfolio, while providing liquidity to fund increases in loan demand or to offset fluctuations in deposits. The Bank’s restricted investments include holdings of FHLB stock and stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the “Reserve Bank”).   
GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The following summary addresses certain provisions of federal and state laws that apply to the Company or the Bank. This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions.
 
EFFECT OF GOVERNMENTAL MONETARY POLICIES. The earnings and business of the Company and the Bank are affected by the economic and monetary policies of various regulatory authorities of the United States, especially the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Federal Reserve, among other things, regulates the supply of credit and money and setting interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions within the United States. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve for those purposes influence in various ways the overall level of investments, loans, other extensions of credits, and deposits, and the interest rates paid on liabilities and received on assets. Federal Reserve monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.
 
SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002. The Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), including the filing of annual, quarterly, and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). As an Exchange Act reporting company, the Company is directly affected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”), which is aimed at improving corporate governance, internal controls and reporting procedures. The Company is complying with applicable SEC and other rules and regulations implemented pursuant to SOX.
 
BANK HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION. The Company is a one-bank holding company, registered with the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”). As such, the Company is subject to the supervision, examination, and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. The Company is required to furnish to the Federal Reserve an annual report of its operations at the end of each fiscal year and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHC Act. The BHC Act generally prohibits the Company from engaging in activities other than banking or managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries and from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect control of any company engaged in any activities other than those activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be sufficiently related to banking or managing or controlling banks. With some limited exceptions, the BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: acquiring substantially all the assets of any bank; acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition it would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares); or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. In addition, and subject to some exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company.
 
BANK REGULATION. The Bank is chartered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and is a member of the Federal Reserve System.  The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve and the Virginia State Corporation Commission (“SCC”) and to other laws and regulations applicable to banks. These regulations include limitations on loans to a single borrower and to the Bank’s directors, officers and employees; requirements on the opening and closing of branch offices; requirements regarding the maintenance of prescribed regulatory capital and liquidity ratios; requirements to grant credit under equal and fair conditions; and requirements to disclose the costs and terms of such credit. The FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank’s customers to the maximum extent provided by law and, as a result, the Bank is also subject to regulation by the FDIC.  The Bank’s regulators have broad enforcement powers over the Bank, including the power to impose fines and other civil or criminal penalties and to appoint a receiver in order to conserve the Bank’s assets for the benefit of depositors and other creditors.
 4


The Bank is also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”). Under the terms of the CRA, the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that bank, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency’s assessment of a bank’s record is made available to the public. Such assessment is required of any bank that has applied to (i) charter a national bank, (ii) obtain deposit insurance coverage for a newly chartered institution, (iii) establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, (iv) relocate an office, or (v) merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company, the Federal Reserve will assess the record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company, and such records may be the basis for denying the application. The Bank received a rating of “satisfactory” at its last CRA performance evaluation as of February 9, 2015.
 
DIVIDENDS. Dividends from the Bank constitute the primary source of funds for dividends to be paid by the Company. There are various statutory and contractual limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, extend credit, or otherwise supply funds to the Company, including the requirement under Virginia banking laws that cash dividends only be paid out of net undivided profits and only if such dividends would not impair the capital of the Bank. The Federal Reserve also has the general authority to limit the dividends paid by bank holding companies and state member banks, if the payment of dividends is deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only if (i) the organization’s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fund fully the dividends and (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Bank does not expect any of these laws, regulations or policies to materially impact its ability to pay dividends to the Company.
 
DEPOSIT INSURANCE. Each of the Bank’s depository accounts is insured by the FDIC against loss to the depositor to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and federal law and regulatory policy impose a number of obligations and restrictions on the Company and the Bank to reduce potential loss exposure to depositors and to the DIF.  The deposit insurance assessment is based on average total assets minus average tangible equity, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”).
 
The FDIC utilizes a “financial ratios method” based on the CAMELS composite ratings to determine assessment rates for small established institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. The CAMELS rating system is a supervisory rating system designed to reflect financial and operational risks that a bank may face, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk (“CAMELS”). CAMELS composite ratings set a maximum assessment for CAMELS 1 and 2 rated banks, and set minimum assessments for lower rated institutions.
 
During 2016, the FDIC raised the DIF’s minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.  The FDIC imposed a 4.5 basis point annual surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The rule granted credits to smaller banks, such as the Bank, for the portion of their regular assessments that contribute to increasing the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%.  The minimum reserve ratio reached 1.35% in the third quarter of 2018.  In addition, all FDIC insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC at an annual rate of approximately one basis point of insured deposits to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019.
 
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  Federal bank regulators have issued substantially similar guidelines requiring banks and bank holding companies to maintain capital at certain levels.  In addition, regulators may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels because of its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
 
The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted rules to implement the Basel III capital framework as outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Capital Rules”). For the purposes of the Basel III Capital Rules, (i) common equity tier 1 capital consists principally of common stock (including surplus) and retained earnings; (ii) Tier 1 capital consists principally of common equity Tier 1 capital plus noncumulative preferred stock and related surplus, and certain grandfathered cumulative preferred stocks and trust preferred securities; and (iii) Tier 2 capital consists principally of Tier 1 capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and preferred stock, and limited amounts of an institution’s allowance for loan losses.  Each regulatory capital classification is subject to certain adjustments and limitations, as implemented by the Basel III Capital Rules.  The Basel III Capital Rules also establish risk weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by community banks, including applying higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans.
 5


The Basel III Capital Rules require banks and bank holding companies to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%); (ii) a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%); (iii) a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter).  The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until it was fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress.  Banking organizations with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
 
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV”).  Among other things, these standards revise the standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital.  Under the proposed framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing-in through January 1, 2027.  Under the current capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company.  The impact of Basel IV on the Company and the Bank will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulatory agencies.
 
The Company meets the eligibility criteria of a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (the “SBHC Policy Statement”). On August 28, 2018, the Federal Res
erve issued an interim final rule required by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, which was signed into law on May 24, 2018 (the “EGRRCPA”), that expands the applicability of the SBHC Policy Statement to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion (up from the prior $1 billion threshold).  Under the SBHC Policy Statement, qualifying bank holding companies, such as the Company, have additional flexibility in the amount of debt they can issue and are also exempt from the Basel III Capital Rules.  The SBHC Policy Statement does not apply to the Bank and the Bank must comply with the Basel III Capital Rules.  The Bank must also comply with the capital requirements set forth in the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as described below.
 
On November 21, 2018, the federal bank regulators jointly issued a proposed rule required by the EGRRCPA that would permit qualifying banks and bank holding companies that have less than $10 billion in consolidated assets to elect to be subject to a 9% leverage ratio that would be applied using less complex leverage calculations (commonly referred to as the community bank leverage ratio or “CBLR”). Under the proposed rule, banks and bank holding companies that opt into the CBLR framework and maintain a CBLR of greater than 9% would not be subject to other risk-based and leverage capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules and would be deemed to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements under the “prompt corrective action” framework.  The rule is in proposed form so the content and scope of the final rule, and its impact on the Company and the Bank (if any), cannot be determined.
 
PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION. Federal banking agencies have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” These terms are defined under uniform regulations issued by each of the federal banking agencies regulating these institutions. An insured depository institution which is less than adequately capitalized must adopt an acceptable capital restoration plan, is subject to increased regulatory oversight and is increasingly restricted in the scope of its permissible activities. 
 
To be well capitalized under these regulations, a bank must have the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8.0%; (iii) a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 10.0%; and (iv) a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%.  As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was considered “well capitalized.”
 
As described above, on November 21, 2018, the federal bank regulators jointly issued a proposed rule required by the EGRRCPA that would permit qualifying banks and bank holding companies that have less than $10 billion in consolidated assets elect to opt into the CBLR framework.  Banks opting into the CBLR framework and maintaining a CBLR of greater than 9% would be deemed to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements under the “prompt corrective action” framework.  The rule is in proposed form so the content and scope of the final rule, and its impact on the Company and the Bank (if any), cannot be determined.

SOURCE OF STRENGTH. Federal Reserve policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
 
FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF ATLANTA. The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides funding to their members for making housing loans as well as loans for affordable housing and community development lending. FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to its members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB in an amount equal to at least 5% of the aggregate outstanding advances made by the FHLB to the Bank. In addition, the Bank is required to pledge collateral for outstanding advances. The borrowing agreement with the FHLB provides for the pledge by the Bank of various forms of securities and mortgage loans as collateral.
 
USA PATRIOT ACT. The USA PATRIOT Act provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering. Among other provisions, the USA PATRIOT Act permits financial institutions, upon providing notice to the United States Treasury, to share information with one another in order to better identify and report to the federal government concerning activities that may involve money laundering or terrorists’ activities. The USA PATRIOT Act is considered a significant banking law in terms of information disclosure regarding certain customer transactions. Certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act impose the obligation to establish anti-money laundering programs, including the development of a customer identification program, and the screening of all customers against any government lists of known or suspected terrorists. Although it does create a reporting obligation and a cost of compliance, the USA PATRIOT Act has not materially affected the Bank’s products, services, or other business activities.
 
OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for administering and enforcing economic and trade sanctions against specified foreign parties, including countries and regimes, foreign individuals and other foreign organizations and entities. OFAC publishes lists of prohibited parties that are regularly consulted by the Company in the conduct of its business in order to assure compliance. The Company is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, prohibited parties identified by OFAC, avoiding unlicensed trade and financial transactions with such parties and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with OFAC requirements could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the Company.
 
MORTGAGE BANKING REGULATION. The Bank’s mortgage banking activities are subject to the rules and regulations of, and examination by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and state regulatory authorities with respect to originating, processing and selling mortgage loans. Those rules and regulations, among other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and, in some cases, restrict certain loan features, and fix maximum interest rates and fees. In addition to other federal laws, mortgage origination activities are subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, S.A.F.E. Act, and the regulations promulgated under these acts. These laws prohibit discrimination, require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs, limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered and require the maintenance and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution and income level.
 
CONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS. The Bank is subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth-in-Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act, and regulations issued under such acts, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such customers.

The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB focuses on (i) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws, (ii) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets, (iii) depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services, and (iv) non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services.
 
The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction.
 
ABILITY-TO-REPAY AND QUALIFIED MORTGAGE RULE. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower's ability-to-repay, and allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a “qualified mortgage” as defined by the Dodd-Frank Act and CFPB regulations. In general, a “qualified mortgage” is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages that are “higher-priced” (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not “higher-priced” (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. The Company is predominantly an originator of compliant qualified mortgages.
 
LOANS TO INSIDERS. The Federal Reserve Act and related regulations impose specific restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders of banks. Specifically, loans to a director, an executive officer and to a principal shareholder of a bank, and some affiliated entities of any of the foregoing, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated entities, the bank’s loan-to-one borrower limit. Loans in the aggregate to insiders and their related interests as a class may not exceed the Bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans exceeding these amounts are prohibited, unless such loan is approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank with any “interested” director not participating in the voting. The FDIC has prescribed the loan amount, which includes all other outstanding loans to such person, as to which such prior board of director approval is required, as being the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (up to $500,000). Loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders are required to be made on terms and underwriting standards substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons.
 
CYBERSECURITY. Federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a financial institution’s board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial products and services. The federal banking agencies expect financial institutions to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, and also expect financial institutions to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack. If the financial institution fails to meet the expectations set forth in this regulatory guidance, the institution could be subject to various regulatory actions, including financial penalties, and any remediation efforts may require significant resources. 
 
INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. Federal bank regulatory agencies issued regulatory guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Bank, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” The findings will be included in reports of examination, and deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. As of December 31, 2018, the Company is not aware of any instances of noncompliance with the guidance.
 
FUTURE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY. Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which the Company and the Bank operate and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an

increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to business strategy, and limit the ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank could have a material, adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Bank.
 
COMPETITION
 The Company encounters strong competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits. In one or more aspects of its business, the Bank competes with other commercial banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, financial technology companies, and other financial intermediaries. Most of these competitors, some of which are affiliated with bank holding companies, have substantially greater resources and lending limits, and may offer certain services that the Bank does not currently provide. In addition, many of the Bank’s nonbank competitors are not subject to the same level of federal regulation that governs bank holding companies and federally insured banks. Recent federal and state legislation has heightened the competitive environment in which financial institutions must conduct their business, and the potential for competition among financial institutions of all types has increased significantly. To compete, the Bank relies upon specialized services, responsive handling of customer needs, and personal contacts by its officers, directors, and staff. Large multi-branch banking institutions tend to compete based primarily on price and the number and location of branches while smaller financial institutions tend to compete primarily on price and personal service.
EMPLOYEES
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank employed approximately 142 full-time equivalent employees. No employee is represented by a collective bargaining unit. The Company and the Bank consider relations with employees to be good.
