ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

Background
IDACORP, Inc. (IDACORP) is a holding company incorporated in 1998 under the laws of the state of Idaho. Its principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power Company (Idaho Power). IDACORP is subject to the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which provides the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state utility regulatory commissions with access to books and records and imposes record retention and reporting requirements on IDACORP.

Idaho Power was incorporated under the laws of the state of Idaho in 1989 as the successor to a Maine corporation that was organized in 1915 and began operations in 1916. Idaho Power is an electric utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, sale, and purchase of electric energy and capacity and is regulated by the state regulatory commissions of Idaho and Oregon and by the FERC. Idaho Power is the parent of Idaho Energy Resources Co. (IERCo), a joint venturer in Bridger Coal Company (BCC), which mines and supplies coal to the Jim Bridger generating plant owned in part by Idaho Power. Idaho Power's utility operations constitute nearly all of IDACORP's current business operations and are IDACORP’s only reportable business segment. Segment financial information is presented in Note 17 – "Segment Information" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. As of December 31, 2017, IDACORP had 1,972 full-time employees, 1,964 of whom were employed by Idaho Power, and 11 part-time employees, 9 of whom were employed by Idaho Power.

IDACORP’s other notable subsidiaries include IDACORP Financial Services, Inc.

UTILITY OPERATIONS
Background

Idaho Power provided electric utility service to more than 545,000 general business customers in southern Idaho and eastern Oregon as of December 31, 2017. Approximately 454,000 of these customers are residential. Idaho Power’s principal commercial and industrial customers are involved in food processing, electronics and general manufacturing, agriculture, health care, and winter recreation. Idaho Power holds franchises, typically in the form of right-of-way arrangements, in 72 cities in Idaho and 7 cities in Oregon and holds certificates from the respective public utility regulatory authorities to serve all or a portion of 25 counties in Idaho and 3 counties in Oregon. Idaho Power's service area is shaded in the illustration on the following page and covers approximately 24,000 square miles with an estimated population of 1.2 million.

Idaho Power is under the jurisdiction (as to rates, service, accounting, and other general matters of utility operation) of the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC), the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC), and the FERC. The IPUC and OPUC determine the rates that Idaho Power is authorized to charge to its general business customers. Idaho Power is also under the regulatory jurisdiction of the IPUC, the OPUC, and the Public Service Commission of Wyoming as to the issuance of debt and equity securities. As a public utility under the Federal Power Act (FPA), Idaho Power has authority to charge market-based rates for wholesale energy sales under its FERC tariff and to provide transmission services under its open access transmission tariff (OATT). Additionally, the FERC has jurisdiction over Idaho Power's sales of transmission capacity and wholesale electricity, hydroelectric project relicensing, and system reliability, among other items. 
Regulatory Accounting
Idaho Power is subject to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, with the impacts of rate regulation reflected in its financial statements. These principles sometimes result in Idaho Power recording expenses and revenues in a different period than when an unregulated enterprise would record such expenses and revenues. In these instances, the amounts are deferred or accrued as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet and recorded on the income statement when recovered or returned in rates or when otherwise directed to begin amortization by a regulator. Additionally, regulators can impose regulatory liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers that are expected to be refunded. Idaho Power records regulatory assets or liabilities if it is probable that they will be reflected in future prices, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence.

Idaho Power is working to continue to provide safe, affordable, reliable service to its customers from a diversified source of generation resources, with a continued commitment to strong, sustainable financial results and strong credit ratings. 
Rates and Revenues
Idaho Power generates revenue primarily through the sale of electricity to retail and wholesale customers and the provision of transmission service. The prices that the IPUC, the OPUC, and the FERC authorize Idaho Power to charge for the electric power and services Idaho Power sells are critical factors in determining IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. In addition to the discussion below, for more information on Idaho Power's regulatory framework and rate regulation, see the “Regulatory Matters” section of Part II, Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A) and Note 3 – “Regulatory Matters” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Retail Rates: Idaho Power continually evaluates the need to request changes to its retail electricity price structure to cover its operating costs and to earn a fair return on its investments. Idaho Power uses general rate cases, power cost adjustment mechanisms in Idaho and Oregon, a fixed cost adjustment (FCA) mechanism in Idaho, balancing accounts and tariff riders, and subject-specific filings to recover its costs of providing service and to earn a return on investment. Retail prices are generally determined through formal ratemaking proceedings that are conducted under established procedures and schedules before the issuance of a final order. Participants in these proceedings include Idaho Power, the staffs of the IPUC or OPUC, and other interested parties. The IPUC and OPUC are charged with ensuring that the prices and terms of service are fair, non-discriminatory, and provide Idaho Power an opportunity to recover its prudently incurred or allowable costs and expenditures and earn a reasonable return on investment. The ability to request rate changes does not, however, ensure that Idaho Power will recover all of its costs or earn a specified rate of return, or that its costs will be recovered in advance of or at the same time as the costs are incurred. 
In addition to general rate case filings, ratemaking proceedings can involve charges or credits related to specific costs, programs, or activities, as well as the recovery or refund of amounts recorded under specific authorization from the IPUC or 
9


OPUC but deferred for recovery or refund. Deferred amounts are generally collected from or refunded to retail customers through the use of base rates or supplemental tariffs. Outside of base rates, three of the most significant mechanisms for recovery of costs are the power cost adjustment mechanisms, FCA mechanism, and energy efficiency rider. The Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms are intended to address the volatility of power supply costs and provide for annual adjustments to the rates charged to retail customers by allowing partial recovery or refund of the difference between net power supply costs included in base rates and actual net power supply costs incurred by Idaho Power. The FCA mechanism is designed to remove Idaho Power’s financial disincentive to invest in energy efficiency programs by separating (or decoupling) the recovery of fixed costs from the variable kilowatt-hour charge for certain Idaho customer classes and linking it instead to a set amount per customer. Separately, Idaho Power collects most of its energy efficiency program costs through an energy efficiency rider on customer bills. 
Wholesale Markets: Idaho Power’s OATT transmission rate is revised each year based primarily on financial and operational data Idaho Power files annually with the FERC in its Form 1. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 granted the FERC increased statutory authority to implement mandatory transmission and network reliability standards, as well as enhanced oversight of power and transmission markets, including protection against market manipulation. These mandatory transmission and reliability standards were developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), which have responsibility for compliance and enforcement of transmission and reliability standards.

Idaho Power participates in the wholesale energy markets by purchasing power to help meet load demands and selling power that is in excess of load demands. Idaho Power's market activities are guided by a risk management policy and frequently updated operating plans. These operating plans are impacted by factors such as customer demand for power, market prices, generating costs, transmission constraints, and availability of generating resources. Some of Idaho Power's 17 hydroelectric generation facilities are operated to optimize the water that is available by choosing when to run hydroelectric generation units and when to store water in reservoirs. Idaho Power at times operates these and its other generation facilities to take advantage of market opportunities. These decisions affect the timing and volumes of market purchases and market sales. Even in below-normal water years, there are opportunities to vary water usage to capture wholesale marketplace economic benefits, maximize generation unit efficiency and meet peak loads. Compliance factors such as allowable river stage elevation changes and flood control requirements also influence these generation dispatch decisions. Idaho Power's off-system sales revenues depend largely on the availability of generation resources above the amount necessary to serve customer loads as well as market power prices at the time when those resources are available. A reduction in either factor leads to lower off-system sales revenue. 

Energy Sales: Weather, seasonal customer demand, and economic conditions all impact the amount of electricity that Idaho Power sells as well as the costs it incurs to provide that electricity. Idaho Power's utility revenues are not earned, and associated expenses are not incurred, evenly during the year. Idaho Power’s retail energy sales typically peak during the summer irrigation and cooling season, with a lower peak in the winter. Extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating, and moderate temperatures decrease sales. Increased precipitation levels during the agricultural growing season reduce electricity sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps. The table that follows presents Idaho Power’s revenues and sales volumes for the last three years, classified by customer type. Approximately 95 percent of Idaho Power’s general business revenue originates from customers located in Idaho, with the remainder originating from customers located in Oregon. Idaho Power’s operations, including information on energy sales, are discussed further in Part II, Item 7 - MD&A - "Results of Operations - Utility Operations.”

Competition: Idaho Power's electric utility business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly. Idaho Power's rates for retail electric services are generally determined on a “cost of service” basis. Rates are designed to provide, after recovery of allowable operating expenses including depreciation on capital investments, an opportunity for Idaho Power to earn a reasonable return on investment as authorized by regulators. However, alternative methods of generation, including customer-owned solar and other forms of distributed generation, compete with Idaho Power for sales to existing customers. Also, development of new technologies and services to help energy consumers manage energy in new ways could continue to alter demand for Idaho Power's electric energy. Idaho Power also competes with fuel distribution companies, including natural gas providers, in serving the energy needs of customers for space heating, water heating, and appliances.
Idaho Power also participates in the wholesale energy markets and in the electric transmission markets. Generally, these wholesale markets are regulated by the FERC, which requires electric utilities to transmit power to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers and make available, on a non-discriminatory basis, transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services. 
In return for agreeing to provide service to all customers within a defined service area, electric utilities are typically provided with an exclusive right to provide service in that service area. However, certain prescribed areas within Idaho Power's service area, such as municipalities or Native American Tribal reservations, may elect not to take service from Idaho Power and instead operate as a municipal electric utility or otherwise as a separate entity. In such cases, the entity would be required to purchase or otherwise obtain rights (such as by contract) to Idaho Power's distribution infrastructure within the municipal or other designated area. Idaho Power would have no responsibility for providing electric service to the municipal or separate entity, absent Idaho Power's voluntary execution of an agreement to provide that service. Separately, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, located in southeastern Idaho, have considered the adoption of a utility code applicable to electric utilities operating within the Shoshone-Bannock Tribal Reservation (Reservation). The tribal utility code, if adopted, could ultimately lead to Idaho Power's cessation of its historical provision of service to the Reservation and could result in either no or a limited electric service relationship with the Reservation, or could result solely in Idaho Power's sale of power to the Reservation pursuant to a power purchase agreement. Idaho Power estimates that the average load for the Reservation over the prior five years is approximately 14 Megawatts (MW).
Power Supply

Overview: Idaho Power primarily relies on company-owned hydroelectric, coal-fired, and gas-fired generation facilities and long-term power purchase agreements to supply the energy needed to serve customers. Market purchases and sales are used to 
11


supplement Idaho Power's generation and balance supply and demand throughout the year. Idaho Power’s generating plants and their capacities are listed in Part I, Item 2 - “Properties.”

Weather, load demand, supply constraints, economic conditions, and availability of generation resources impact power supply costs. Idaho Power’s annual hydroelectric generation varies depending on water conditions in the Snake River Basin. Drought conditions and increased peak load demand cause a greater reliance on potentially more expensive energy sources to meet load requirements. Conversely, favorable hydroelectric generation conditions increase production at Idaho Power’s hydroelectric generating facilities and reduce the need for thermal generation and wholesale market purchased power. Economic conditions and governmental regulations can affect the market price of natural gas and coal, which may impact fuel expense and market prices for purchased power. Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms mitigate in large part the potentially adverse financial statement impacts of volatile fuel and power costs.
Idaho Power’s system is dual peaking, with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer. The all-time system peak demand was 3,422 MW, set on July 7, 2017. On January 6, 2017, Idaho Power tied its highest all-time winter peak demand of 2,527 MW, which was originally set on December 10, 2009. During these and other similarly heavy load periods, Idaho Power’s system is fully committed to serve load and meet required operating reserves. The table that follows shows Idaho Power’s total power supply for the last three years.

 | Power Supply | Percent of Total Generation
 | 2017 | 2016 | | 2015 | 2017 | 2016 | | 2015
 | (thousands of MWh) | | 
Hydroelectric plants | 8,900 | | 6,408 | | 5,910 | | 65 | % | 53 | % | 47 | %

Hydroelectric Generation: Idaho Power operates 17 hydroelectric projects located on the Snake River and its tributaries. Together, these hydroelectric facilities provide a total nameplate capacity of 1,706 MW and annual generation of approximately 8.5 million MWh under median water conditions. The amount of water available for hydroelectric power generation depends on several factors—the amount of snowpack in the mountains upstream of Idaho Power’s hydroelectric facilities, upstream reservoir storage, springtime precipitation and temperatures, main river and tributary base flows, the condition of the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer and its spring flow impact, summer time irrigation withdrawals and returns, and upstream reservoir regulation. Idaho Power actively participates in collaborative work groups focused on water management issues in the Snake River Basin, with the goal of preserving the long-term availability of water for use at Idaho Power’s hydroelectric projects on the Snake River. 
In 2017, above normal winter and spring precipitation resulted in 8.9 million MWh of hydroelectric generation, a significant increase from the past two years. In 2016, low upstream reservoir carryover (primarily in the upper Snake River basin) resulted in reduced downstream flow releases. Additionally, although snowpack accumulation was near-normal on April 1, 2016, the snowpack melted earlier than usual. The combined effect was lower than median hydro production of 6.4 million MWh in 2016. In 2015, below-normal snow accumulation resulted in a lower than median hydro production of 5.9 million MWh. During low water years, when stream flows into Idaho Power’s hydroelectric projects are reduced, Idaho Power’s hydroelectric generation is reduced, resulting in a greater reliance on other generation resources and power purchases. For 2018, Idaho Power estimates annual generation from its hydroelectric facilities to be between 7.5 million MWh and 9.5 million MWh. 

Idaho Power obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the FERC, similar to other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways. The licensing process includes an extensive public review process and involves numerous natural resource and environmental agencies. The licenses last from 30 to 50 years depending on the size, complexity, and cost of the project. Idaho Power is actively pursuing the relicensing of the Hells Canyon Complex, its largest hydroelectric generation source. Idaho Power also has three Oregon licenses under the Oregon Hydroelectric Act, which applies 
12


to Idaho Power’s Brownlee, Oxbow, and Hells Canyon facilities. For further information on relicensing activities, see Part II, Item 7 – MD&A – "Regulatory Matters – Relicensing of Hydroelectric Projects.”
Idaho Power is subject to the provisions of the FPA as a “public utility” and as a “licensee” by virtue of its hydroelectric operations. As a licensee under Part I of the FPA, Idaho Power and its licensed hydroelectric projects are subject to conditions described in the FPA and related FERC regulations. These conditions and regulations include, among other items, provisions relating to condemnation of a project upon payment of just compensation, amortization of project investment from excess project earnings, and possible takeover of a project after expiration of its license upon payment of net investment and severance damages.

Coal-Fired Generation: Idaho Power co-owns the following coal-fired power plants:

• | Jim Bridger, located in Wyoming, in which Idaho Power has a one-third interest;


• | North Valmy, located in Nevada, in which Idaho Power has a 50 percent interest; and


• | Boardman, located in Oregon, in which Idaho Power has a 10 percent interest.

BCC supplies coal to the Jim Bridger power plant. IERCo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Idaho Power, owns a one-third interest in BCC and PacifiCorp owns a two-third interest in BCC and is the operator of the Bridger Coal Mine. The mine operates under a long-term sales agreement that provides for delivery of coal through 2024 from surface and underground sources. Idaho Power believes that BCC has sufficient reserves to provide coal deliveries for at least the term of the sales agreement. Idaho Power also has a coal supply contract providing for annual deliveries of coal through 2021 from the Black Butte mine located near the Jim Bridger plant. This contract supplements the BCC deliveries and provides another coal supply to fuel the Jim Bridger plant. The Jim Bridger plant’s rail load-in facility and unit coal train, while limited, provides the opportunity to access other fuel supplies for tonnage requirements above established contract minimums.

NV Energy is the operator of the North Valmy power plant (Valmy Plant). Idaho Power's existing coal inventory at the Valmy Plant is expected to meet Idaho Power's projected coal requirements at the plant through at least 2018. Idaho Power expects to be able to obtain future coal requirements through coal supply contracts. In 2017, Idaho Power established a process approved by the IPUC and OPUC for recovery of costs related to Idaho Power’s plan to end its participation in coal-fired operations at the Valmy Plant units 1 and 2 in 2019 and 2025, respectively. In both 2017 and 2016, the Valmy Plant provided 2 percent of Idaho Power's total generation. For additional information on the related settlement stipulations, see Part II, Item 7 – MD&A - "Regulatory Matters - Valmy Base Rate Adjustment Settlement Stipulations and Depreciation Rate Settlement Stipulations."
Portland General Electric Company is the operator of the Boardman power plant. Idaho Power believes that it has sufficient inventory and coal contracts to supply the Boardman plant with fuel through 2018. The Boardman plant receives coal through annual contracts with suppliers from the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming. Idaho Power expects to meet future coal needs through similar contracts. In December 2010, the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission approved a plan to cease coal-fired operations at the Boardman power plant no later than December 31, 2020.
Natural Gas-fired Generation: Idaho Power owns and operates the Langley Gulch natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant and the Danskin and Bennett Mountain natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine power plants. All three plants are located in Idaho. 
Idaho Power operates the Langley Gulch plant as a baseload unit and the Danskin and Bennett Mountain plants to meet peak supply needs. The plants are also used to take advantage of wholesale market opportunities. Natural gas for all facilities is purchased based on system requirements and dispatch efficiency. The natural gas is transported through the Williams-Northwest Pipeline under Idaho Power's 55,584 million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day long-term gas transportation service agreements. These transportation agreements vary in contract length but generally contain the right for Idaho Power to extend the term. In addition to the long-term gas transportation service agreements, Idaho Power has entered into a long-term storage service agreement with Northwest Pipeline for 131,453 MMBtu of total storage capacity at the Jackson Prairie Storage Project. This firm storage contract expires in 2043. Idaho Power purchases and stores natural gas with the intent of fulfilling needs as identified for seasonal peaks or to meet system requirements.

As of December 31, 2017, approximately 6.5 million MMBtu of natural gas was financially hedged for physical delivery for the operational dispatch of the Langley Gulch plant through June 2019. Idaho Power plans to manage the procurement of additional natural gas for the peaking units on the daily spot market or from storage inventory as necessary to meet system requirements and fueling strategies.

Purchased Power: As described below, Idaho Power purchases power in the wholesale market as well as power pursuant to long-term power purchase contracts and exchange agreements.
Wholesale Market Transactions: To supplement its self-generated power and long-term purchase arrangements, Idaho Power purchases power in the wholesale market based on economics, operating reserve margins, risk management policy requirements, and unit availability. Depending on availability of excess power or generation capacity, pricing, and opportunities in the markets, Idaho Power also sells power in the wholesale markets. During 2017 and 2016, Idaho Power purchased 0.9 million MWh and 1.4 million MWh of power through wholesale market purchases at an average cost of $26.32 per MWh and $24.80 per MWh, respectively. During 2017 and 2016, Idaho Power sold 2.1 million MWh and 1.2 million MWh of power in wholesale market sales, with an average price of $15.63 per MWh and $21.25 per MWh, respectively. 
Long-term Power Purchase and Exchange Arrangements: In addition to its wholesale market purchases, Idaho Power has the following notable firm long-term power purchase contracts and energy exchange agreements:

• | Telocaset Wind Power Partners, LLC - for 101 MW (nameplate generation) from its Elkhorn Valley wind project located in eastern Oregon. The contract term is through 2027.


• | USG Oregon LLC - for 22 MW (estimated average annual output) from the Neal Hot Springs #1 geothermal power plant located near Vale, Oregon. The contract term ends in 2037.


• | Clatskanie People's Utility - for the exchange of up to 18 MW of energy from the Arrowrock hydroelectric project in southern Idaho in exchange for energy from Idaho Power's system or power purchased at the Mid-Columbia trading hub. The contract term continues through 2020. Idaho Power has the right to renew the agreement for an additional five-year term.


• | Raft River Energy I, LLC - for up to 13 MW (nameplate generation) from its Raft River Geothermal Power Plant Unit #1 located in southern Idaho. The contract term ends in 2033.


PURPA Power Purchase Contracts: Idaho Power purchases power from PURPA projects as mandated by federal law. As of December 31, 2017, Idaho Power had contracts with on-line PURPA-related projects with a total of 1,114 MW of nameplate generation capacity, with an additional 5 MW nameplate capacity of projects projected to be on-line in 2018 and an additional 24 MW expected to be added in 2019. The power purchase contracts for these projects have original contract terms ranging from one to 35 years. The expense and volume of PURPA project power purchases during the last three years is included in the following table: 

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
PURPA contract expense (in thousands) | $ | 169,788 | | | $ | 153,665 | | $ | 131,340
MWh purchased under PURPA contracts (in thousands) | 2,800 | | | 2,314 | | | 2,008
Average cost per MWh from PURPA contracts | $ | 60.64 | | | $ | 66.41 | | $ | 65.41 

Pursuant to the requirements of PURPA, the IPUC and OPUC have each issued orders and rules regulating Idaho Power’s purchase of power from "qualifying facilities" that meet the requirements of PURPA. A key component of the PURPA contracts is the energy price contained within the agreements. PURPA regulations specify that a utility must pay energy prices based on the utility’s avoided costs. The IPUC and OPUC have established specific rules and regulations to calculate the avoided cost that Idaho Power is required to include in PURPA contracts. For PURPA power purchase agreements:


• | Idaho Power is required to purchase all of the output from the facilities located inside its service area, subject to some exceptions such as adverse impacts on system reliability.


• | Idaho Power is required to purchase the output of projects located outside its service area if it has the ability to receive power at the facility’s requested point of delivery on Idaho Power's system.


• | The IPUC jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with PURPA contracts is fully recovered through base rates and the Idaho PCA mechanism, and the OPUC jurisdictional portion is recovered through base rates and an Oregon power cost recovery mechanism. Thus, the primary impact of high power purchase costs under PURPA contracts is on customer rates.


• | OPUC jurisdictional regulations have generally provided for PURPA standard contract terms of up to 20 years.


• | The IPUC requires Idaho Power to pay "published avoided cost" rates for all wind and solar projects that are smaller than 100 kilowatts (kW) and all other types of projects that are smaller than 10 average MWs. For PURPA qualifying facilities that exceed these size limitations, Idaho Power is required to negotiate an applicable price (premised on avoided costs) based upon IPUC regulations.

14



• | The IPUC issued an order in August 2015 that revised the standard PURPA power purchase contract term for new contracts to a 2-year term from the previously required 20-year term for projects that exceed the size limitations for published avoided costs.


• | The OPUC requires that Idaho Power pay the published avoided costs for solar PURPA qualifying facilities with a nameplate rating of 3 MW or less and all other types of projects with a nameplate rating of 10 MW or less. Idaho Power is required to negotiate an applicable price (premised on avoided costs) for all other qualifying facilities based upon OPUC regulations.

Anticipated Participation in Western Energy Imbalance Market: Utilities in the western United States outside the California Independent System Operator (California ISO) have traditionally relied upon a combination of automated and manual dispatch within the hour to balance generation and load to maintain reliable supply. These utilities have limited capability to transact within the hour outside their balancing area. In contrast, energy imbalance markets use automated intra-hour economic dispatch of generation from committed resources to serve loads. The California ISO and PacifiCorp implemented an energy imbalance market in 2014 (Western EIM) under which the parties enabled their systems to interact for dispatch purposes. The Western EIM is intended to reduce the power supply costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, to integrate intermittent power from renewable generation sources more effectively, and to enhance reliability. Participation in the Western EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western United States. Following an evaluation of the potential power supply cost savings and other advantages, system upgrade requirements, and estimated capital and ongoing operating costs, Idaho Power executed an agreement under which it intends to, subject to regulatory approval and other conditions, participate in the Western EIM. Idaho Power anticipates that it will commence participation in the Western EIM in April 2018. For information on regulatory proceedings related to costs associated with joining the Western EIM, see Part II, Item 7 – MD&A - "Regulatory Matters - Recovery of Costs for Anticipated Participation in Western Energy Imbalance Market." 

Transmission Services

Electric transmission systems deliver energy from electric generation facilities to distribution systems for final delivery to customers. Transmission systems are designed to move electricity over long distances because generation facilities can be located hundreds of miles away from customers. Idaho Power’s generating facilities are interconnected through its integrated transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to achieve maximum capability and reliability. Idaho Power’s transmission system is directly interconnected with the transmission systems of the Bonneville Power Administration, Avista Corporation, PacifiCorp, NorthWestern Energy, and NV Energy. These interconnections, coupled with transmission line capacity made available under agreements with some of those entities, permit the interchange, purchase, and sale of power among entities in the Western Interconnection, the transmission grid covering much of western North America. Idaho Power provides wholesale transmission service for eligible transmission customers on a non-discriminatory basis. Idaho Power is a member of the WECC, the Northwest PowerPool, the Northern Tier Transmission Group, and the North American Energy Standards Board. These groups have been formed to more efficiently coordinate transmission reliability and planning throughout the Western Interconnection.
Transmission to serve Idaho Power's retail customers is subject to the jurisdiction of the IPUC and OPUC for retail rate making purposes. Idaho Power provides cost-based wholesale and retail access transmission services under the terms of a FERC approved OATT. Services under the OATT are offered on a nondiscriminatory basis such that all potential customers, including Idaho Power, have an equal opportunity to access the transmission system. As required by FERC standards of conduct, Idaho Power's transmission function is operated independently from Idaho Power's energy marketing function. 
Idaho Power is jointly working on the permitting of two significant transmission projects. The Boardman-to-Hemingway line is a proposed 300-mile, 500-kV transmission project between a station near Boardman, Oregon and the Hemingway station near Boise, Idaho. The Gateway West line is a proposed 1,000-mile, 500-kV transmission project between a station located near Douglas, Wyoming and the Hemingway station. Both projects are intended to meet future anticipated resource needs and are discussed in Part II, Item 7 – MD&A - "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Requirements" in this report. 
Resource Planning 

Integrated Resource Planning: The IPUC and OPUC require that Idaho Power prepare biennially an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). Idaho Power filed its most recent IRP in June 2017 (2017 IRP). The IRP seeks to forecast Idaho Power's loads and resources for a 20-year period, analyzes potential supply-side and demand-side resource options, and identifies potential near-term and long-term actions. The four primary goals of the IRP are to: 
15



• | identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growing demand for energy within Idaho Power's service area throughout the 20-year planning period;


• | ensure the selected resource portfolio balances cost, risk, and environmental concerns;


• | give equal and balanced treatment to both supply-side resources and demand-side measures; and


• | involve the public in the planning process in a meaningful way.


During the time between IRP filings, the public and regulatory oversight of the activities identified in the IRP allows for discussion and adjustment of the IRP as warranted. Idaho Power makes periodic adjustments and corrections to the resource plan to reflect economic conditions, anticipated resource development, changes in technology, and regulatory requirements.
The load forecast assumptions Idaho Power used in the 2017 IRP are included in the table below, together with the average annual growth rate assumptions used in the prior two IRPs. The rate of load growth can impact the timing and extent of development of resources, such as new generation plants or transmission infrastructure, to serve those loads.
 | 5-Year Forecast | | 20-Year Forecast
 | Annual Growth Rate: Retail Sales(Billed MWh) | Annual Growth Rate: Annual Peak(Peak Demand) | | Annual Growth Rate: Retail Sales(Billed MWh) | Annual Growth Rate: Annual Peak(Peak Demand)
2017 IRP | 1.1% | 1.6% | | 0.9% | 1.4% 
2015 IRP | 1.1% | 1.5% | | 1.1% | 1.4% 
2013 IRP | 1.2% | 1.5% | | 1.0% | 1.3% 

Idaho Power's 2017 IRP identifies its preferred resource portfolio and action plan. The IRP includes the completion of the Boardman-to-Hemingway 500-kV transmission line by 2026, the end of Idaho Power's participation in coal-fired operations at the North Valmy power plant units 1 and 2 in 2019 and 2025, respectively, and the early retirement of Jim Bridger units 1 and 2 in 2032 and 2028, respectively, with no other new resource needs prior to 2026. However, as noted in the 2017 IRP, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the resource sufficiency estimates and project completion dates, including uncertainty around the timing and extent of third party development of renewable resources, the actual completion date of the Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission project, and the economics and logistics of plant retirements. These and other uncertainties could result in changes to the desirability of the preferred portfolio and adjustments to the timing and nature of anticipated and actual actions. 
Energy Efficiency and Demand Response Programs: Idaho Power’s energy efficiency and demand response portfolio is comprised of 24 programs. These energy efficiency programs target energy savings across the entire year, while the demand response programs target system demand reduction in the summer at times of peak loads. The programs are offered to all customer segments and emphasize the wise use of energy, especially during periods of high demand. This energy and demand reduction can minimize or delay the need for new generation or transmission infrastructure. Idaho Power’s programs include:

• | financial incentives for irrigation customers for either improving the energy efficiency of an irrigation system or installing new energy efficient systems;


• | energy efficiency for new and existing homes including electric heating, ventilation and cooling equipment, as well as energy efficient building techniques, air duct sealing, and energy efficient lighting;


• | incentives to industrial and commercial customers for acquiring energy efficient equipment, and using energy efficiency techniques for operational and management processes;


• | demand response programs to reduce peak summer demand through the voluntary cycling of central air conditioners for residential customers, interruption of irrigation pumps, and reduction of commercial and industrial demand through actions taken by business owners and operators; and


• | membership in the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, which supports market transformation efforts across the region.

In 2017, Idaho Power’s energy efficiency programs reduced energy usage by approximately 170,000 MWh. For 2017, Idaho Power had a demand response available capacity of approximately 394 MW. In 2017 and 2016, Idaho Power expended approximately $48 million and $43 million, respectively, on both energy efficiency and demand response programs. Funding for these programs is provided through a combination of the Idaho and Oregon energy efficiency tariff riders, base rates, and the power cost adjustment mechanisms. Energy efficiency program expenditures funded through the riders are reported as an operating expense with an equal amount of revenues recorded in other revenues, resulting in no net impact on earnings.

Environmental Regulation and Costs
Idaho Power's activities are subject to a broad range of federal, state, regional, and local laws and regulations designed to protect, restore, and enhance the quality of the environment. Environmental regulation impacts Idaho Power’s operations due to the cost of installation and operation of equipment and facilities required for compliance with environmental regulations, the modification of system operations to accommodate environmental regulations, and the cost of acquiring and complying with permits and licenses. In addition to generally applicable regulations, Idaho Power's three coal-fired power plants, three natural gas combustion turbine power plants, and 17 hydroelectric generating plants are subject to a broad range of environmental requirements, including those related to air and water quality, waste materials, and endangered species. For a more detailed discussion of these and other environmental issues, refer to Item 7 - MD&A - "Environmental Matters" in this report.
Environmental Expenditures: Idaho Power’s environmental compliance expenditures will remain significant for the foreseeable future, particularly given the volume of existing and proposed regulations at the federal level. Idaho Power estimates its environmental expenditures, based upon present environmental laws and regulations, will be as follows for the periods indicated, excluding allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) (in millions of dollars):

 | 2018 | | 2019 - 2020
Capital expenditures: | | | 
License compliance and relicensing efforts at hydroelectric facilities | $ | 12 | | | $ | 31
Investments in equipment and facilities at thermal plants | 5 | | | 18 | 
Total capital expenditures | $ | 17 | | | $ | 49
Operating expenses: | | | 
Operating costs for environmental facilities - hydroelectric | $ | 21 | | | $ | 41
Operating costs for environmental facilities - thermal | 11 | | | 24 | 
Total operations and maintenance | $ | 32 | | | $ | 65


Idaho Power anticipates that finalization, implementation, or modification of a number of federal and state rulemakings and other proceedings addressing, among other things, greenhouse gases and endangered species, could result in substantial changes in operating and compliance costs, but Idaho Power is unable to estimate those changes in costs given the uncertainty associated with existing and potential future regulations. Idaho Power expects that it would seek to recover increases in costs through the ratemaking process. Beyond increasing costs generally, these environmental laws and regulations could affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition if the costs associated with these environmental requirements and potential early plant retirements cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis. 
Idaho Power monitors environmental requirements and assesses whether environmental control measures are or remain economically appropriate. Continued review of the economic appropriateness of further investments in coal-fired plants was included in a February 2014 order of the IPUC, in which the IPUC requested that Idaho Power continue monitoring environmental requirements at a national level and account for their impact in resource planning and promptly apprise the IPUC of developments that could impact the company's continued reliance on the Valmy Plant as a coal-fired resource. 
In 2017, the IPUC and OPUC approved a settlement stipulation allowing accelerated depreciation and cost recovery for the Valmy Plant in connection with Idaho Power's plan to end its participation in the operation of unit 1 at the Valmy Plant by the end of 2019 and unit 2 by 2025. The plan to end Idaho Power's participation in operations of units 1 and 2 at the Valmy Plant was based primarily on the economics of operating the plant. The settlement stipulations are described in Part II, Item 7 - MD&A - "Regulatory Matters” in this report. Additionally, in light of the uncertainty resulting from pending environmental regulation and the substantial estimated cost of selective catalytic reduction equipment (SCR) installation, Idaho Power is assessing whether to move forward with the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2 at the Jim Bridger power plant. 
Voluntary CO2 Intensity Reduction Goal: Idaho Power is engaged in voluntary greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) intensity reduction efforts. In September 2009, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's boards of directors approved guidelines that established a goal to reduce Idaho Power's resource portfolio's average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions intensity for the 2010 through 2013 time period to a level of 10 to 15 percent below Idaho Power's 2005 CO2 emissions intensity of 1,194 lbs CO2/MWh. The combination of effective utilization of hydroelectric projects, above average stream flows in some years, reduced usage of coal-fired facilities, the purchase of renewable energy, and the addition of the Langley Gulch natural gas-fired power plant positioned Idaho Power to extend its CO2 emissions intensity reduction goal period for an additional two years, targeting an average reduction of 10 to 15 percent below its 2005 levels for the entire 2010 through 2015 time period. Idaho Power achieved 
17


its initial reduction goal, as well as its extended goal, through 2015. Idaho Power's average CO2 emissions intensity from company-owned resources for the 2010 through 2015 period was 21 percent below the 2005 CO2 emissions intensity level. 
In 2015, Idaho Power further extended and expanded the goal, seeking to reduce the company-owned resource portfolio average CO2 emissions intensity to 15-20 percent below 2005 levels for the 2010-2017 period. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power achieved the reduction goal set in 2015, with carbon emissions intensity at 25 percent below the 2005 level, and further extended the current CO2 emissions intensity reduction goal through 2020.
Idaho Power's estimated historic CO2 emissions intensity from its generation facilities was as follows:

 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 | 2010 
Emissions Intensity (lbs CO2/MWh) | 894 | 934 | 945 | 945 | 929 | 867 | 864 | 1,066

IDACORP FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.

IFS invests in affordable housing developments, which provide a return principally by reducing federal and state income taxes through tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits. IFS has focused on a diversified approach to its investment strategy in order to limit both geographic and operational risk with most of IFS’s investments having been made through syndicated funds. IFS is no longer actively pursuing further investment opportunities, but will continue to maintain and manage its current portfolio of investments. At December 31, 2017, the unamortized amount of IFS’s portfolio was approximately $6 million ($165 million in gross tax credit investments, net of $159 million of accumulated amortization). IFS generated tax credits of $2.6 million in both 2017 and 2016 and $3.3 million in 2015. In 2017 and 2016, IFS received distributions related to fully-amortized affordable housing investments that reduced IDACORP's income tax expense by $1.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
IDA-WEST ENERGY COMPANY

Ida-West operates and has a 50 percent ownership interest in nine hydroelectric projects that have a total generating capacity of 45 MW. Four of the projects are located in Idaho and five are in northern California. All nine projects are “qualifying facilities” under PURPA.
