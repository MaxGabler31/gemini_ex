Overview
Rambus produces products and innovations that address the fundamental challenges of accelerating data. We make industry-leading chips and IP that enable critical performance improvements for data center and other growing markets. The ongoing shift to the cloud, along with the widespread advancement of artificial intelligence (“AI”) across the data center, edge and Internet of Things (“IoT”) end points, has led to exponential growth in data usage and tremendous demands on data infrastructure. Creating fast and safe connections, both in and across systems, remains one of the most mission-critical design challenges limiting performance in advanced hardware for these markets. The data center continues to be the Company’s primary focus market, demanding the highest performance and security, and drives greater than 80% of the revenue from Rambus chip and silicon IP sales. 
As an industry pioneer with over 30 years of advanced semiconductor design experience, Rambus is ideally positioned to address the challenges of moving and protecting data. We are a leader in high-performance memory subsystems, providing chips, IP and innovations that maximize the performance and security in data-intensive systems. Whether in the cloud, at the edge or in your hand, real-time and immersive applications depend on data throughput and integrity. Rambus products and innovations deliver the increased bandwidth, capacity and security required to meet the world’s data needs and drive ever-greater end-user experiences.
Rambus benefits from a balanced and diverse portfolio of offerings across chips, silicon IP and patent licensing with each of them contributing at scale. From 2018 to 2021, product revenue sustained a 55% compound annual growth rate, making products the leading revenue source for the Company. Driven by the continued market momentum of our memory interface chips, we recognized record product revenue of $143.9 million in 2021. The Company achieved silicon IP growth through increasing design wins at leading system on chip (“SoC”) customers with contributions from the businesses acquired in 2021. In addition, Rambus successfully closed key patent licensing agreements, solidifying our foundation of sustained cash generation and fueling investment in our product and technology roadmaps. Rambus continued its technology leadership with the launch of the CXL Memory Interconnect Initiative and development of solutions for next-generation data centers.
Memory Interface Chips
Made for high speed, reliability and power efficiency, Rambus DDR memory interface chips for server memory modules (e.g., RDIMMs) enable increased bandwidth and expanded capacity in enterprise and cloud servers. The Rambus portfolio includes DDR5, DDR4 and DDR3 memory interface chips. Rambus offers the industry’s fastest DDR5 Registering Clock Driver (“RCD”), providing the critical control signals and clock for operation of the memory module at top-of-the-line performance. 
We sell memory interface chips directly and indirectly to memory module manufacturers and OEMs worldwide through multiple channels, including our direct sales force and distributors. We operate direct sales offices in the United States, France, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China, where we employ sales personnel who serve our direct customers and manage our channel partners.
We operate a fabless business model and use third-party foundries and manufacturing contractors to fabricate, assemble and test our memory interface chips. We also inspect and test parts in our U.S.-based facilities. This outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our investment and resources on the research, development, design, sale and marketing of our products. Outsourcing also allows us the flexibility needed to respond to new market opportunities, simplifies our operations and significantly reduces our capital requirements.
Silicon IP
Rambus Silicon IP includes interface and security IP solutions that move and protect data in advanced applications. Our Interface IP solutions feature both high-speed memory and chip-to-chip interconnect technologies. With the acquisitions of AnalogX Inc. and PLDA Group, Rambus expanded its portfolio of physical interface (“PHY”) and digital controller IP to offer industry-leading, integrated memory and interconnect subsystems. These silicon-proven solutions are critical to high-performance data center, networking, AI, Machine Learning (“ML”) and automotive applications because they enable and optimize the transfer of data between chips and electronic devices.
We offer one of the industry’s most comprehensive portfolios of security IP solutions, including crypto cores, hardware roots of trust, high-speed protocol engines and chip provisioning technologies. With the growing threat environment, hardware-based, embedded security solutions are mission-critical for protecting data center, AI, networking, IoT, automotive and government applications.
We sell Silicon IP solutions to leading chip makers worldwide for integration into their SoC and FPGA designs. Rambus Silicon IP is sold through our direct sales force operating out of offices in the United States, France, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China.
Patent Licenses
Our patented inventions are foundational to the semiconductor industry and are licensed to leading semiconductor and system companies around the world. Rambus continues to innovate and invent, thereby advancing semiconductor technology. With a broad worldwide portfolio of patents covering memory architecture, high-speed serial links and security, we enhance our value and relevance in our target markets and create a platform for investment in product development. 
Our patent licenses enable our customers to use specified portions of our portfolio of patented inventions in the customer’s own digital electronics products, systems or services. These licenses may also define the specific field of use where our customers may use or employ our inventions in their products. License agreements are structured with fixed or variable, or a hybrid of fixed and variable royalty payments over certain periods ranging up to ten years. Leading semiconductor and electronic system companies such as AMD, Broadcom, Cisco, CXMT, Fujitsu, IBM, Kioxia, Marvell, Mediatek, Micron, Nanya, NVIDIA, Panasonic, Phison, Qualcomm, Renesas, Samsung, SK hynix, Socionext, STMicroelectronics, Western Digital, Winbond, and Xilinx have licensed our patents for use in their own products.
Competition
The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns, price erosion, increasing foreign and domestic competition and market consolidation. Rambus competes with product offerings from various companies depending upon the particular Rambus product line. In the market for memory interface chips, we compete with international semiconductor companies, including Renesas and Montage Technology. In the Silicon IP market, Rambus competes with the in-house design teams at our potential customers, as well as with third-party IP suppliers such as Cadence and Synopsys. Many of our competitors are larger and have better access to financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we possess.
To the extent that alternative technologies, which might provide comparable system performance at lower or similar cost to our patented technologies, are perceived to require the payment of no or lower fees or royalties, or to the extent other factors influence the industry, our customers and prospective customers may adopt and promote such alternative technologies. Even to the extent we determine that such alternative technologies infringe our patents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to negotiate agreements that would result in royalties being paid to us without litigation, which could be costly and the results of which would be uncertain. As in the past, litigation may be required to enforce and protect our IP rights, as well as the substantial investments undertaken to research and develop our innovations and technologies.
Research and Development
Building upon our foundation of core semiconductor technologies, our research priorities focus on innovation and patent development that enhance the value of our patent portfolio and differentiate our product offerings in the market. Key to our efforts is continuing to hire and retain world-class inventors, scientists and engineers to lead the development and deployment of inventions and technology solutions for our intended markets.
To foster our research and development efforts, we assembled a team of highly-skilled inventors, engineers and scientists whose activities are focused on continually developing new innovations within our chosen technology fields, and thereby securing the IP rights and legal protections for these ground-breaking inventions. Using this foundation of innovation, our technical teams develop new semiconductor solutions that enable increased performance, greater power efficiency and increased levels of security, as well as other improvements and benefits. Our solution design and development process is a multi-disciplinary effort requiring expertise in multiple fields across all of our operational units.
A significant number of our scientists and engineers spend all or a portion of their time on research and development. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, research and development expenses were $135.7 million, $139.8 million and $156.8 million, respectively. We expect to continue to invest substantial funds in research and development activities. In addition, because our customer agreements often call for us to provide engineering support, a portion of our total engineering costs are allocated to the cost of contract and other revenue. 
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 690 employees, of which approximately 39% were in the United States and 61% in other global regions. Additionally, approximately 69% of our employees were engineers with the remaining employees in sales, general and administrative positions. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our primary focus has been on the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. Our global pandemic efforts include instituting a global employee assistance program while leveraging the advice and recommendations of infectious disease experts to establish proper safety standards. As the pandemic continues, the health and well-being of our workforce remains our top priority while we ensure productivity for those employees working from home.
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel. We provide our employees with competitive compensation, as well as opportunities for equity ownership and developmental programs that enable continued learning and growth. We also offer employees benefits such as life and health insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and retirement savings plans. We utilize successful recruiting practices that yield qualified and dedicated employees who are driven to achieve our vision.
Recently, the employment market in the United States has been subject to a hyper-competitive compensation environment especially for technology companies in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere. Our human capital resources objectives, as described above, help us retain and motivate our existing employees, advisors, and consultants, which is a key component of increasing stockholder value and the success of Rambus.
We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion helps us attract and retain the best talent, enables employees to realize their full potential and drives high performance through innovation and collaboration. Because we know that diversity is truly a competitive advantage that helps drive innovation, we strive to maintain a best-in-class work environment that fosters respect for individuals, their ideas and contributions. We benefit from the innovation that results when people with differing experiences, perspectives and cultures work together to achieve a common goal.
Intellectual Property
We maintain and support an active program to protect our IP, primarily through the filing of patent applications and the defense of issued patents against potential infringement. As of December 31, 2021, our technologies are covered by 2,380 U.S. and foreign patents, having expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2040. Additionally, we have 603 patent applications pending. Some of the patents and pending patent applications are derived from a common parent patent application or are foreign counterpart patent applications. We believe our patented innovations provide our customers with the legal rights and licenses to use our inventions to achieve improved performance, greater cost-effectiveness and other technological benefits in their own products and services. We intend to continue our innovation efforts and allocate significant investment in our IP development programs.
We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate and would further our overall business strategy and objectives. In some instances, obtaining appropriate levels of protection may involve prosecuting continuation and counterpart patent applications based on a common parent application. In addition, we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with current and prospective customers, and confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants and other security measures. We also rely on copyright, trademarks and trade secret laws to protect our IP and other proprietary assets.
Backlog
Our sales of memory interface chips are generally made pursuant to short-term purchase orders. These purchase orders are made without deposits and may be, and often are, rescheduled, canceled or modified on relatively short notice, without substantial penalty. Therefore, we believe that purchase orders or backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future product sales.
