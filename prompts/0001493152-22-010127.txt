Organizational History
 
On January 25, 2019, we entered into and closed a securities exchange under a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “Securities Exchange Agreement”) with LGBT Loyalty LLC, a New York limited liability company (“LGBT Loyalty”), and Maxim Partners, LLC (“Maxim”), pursuant to which we acquired all of the membership interests of LGBT Loyalty, making LGBT Loyalty a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, in exchange for 120,959,996 shares of our restricted common stock and one share of our newly created Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). The common stock issued to Maxim represented, upon issuance, 49.99% of our then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Effective March 26, 2019, the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was converted into 8,598,578 shares of our common stock.
 
Effective April 25, 2019, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”) with the Delaware Secretary of State to change our name from LifeApps Brands Inc. to LGBTQ Loyalty Holdings, Inc. The form of and filing of the Certificate of Amendment was approved by our Board of Directors.
 
On June 3, 2019 we filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C COD”) with the Delaware Secretary of State to create a new class of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, designated Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”) and authorized the issuance of up to 129,559 shares of Series C Preferred Stock. On the Closing Date, all of the 129,559 shares of Series C Preferred Stock were issued to Pride Partners, LLC (“Pride”), the assignee of Maxim. On June 4, 2019 we entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement with Maxim (the “Holder”) pursuant to which the Holder exchanged 129,558,574 shares of Common Stock for 129,559 shares (the “Exchange Shares”) of our Series C Preferred Stock (the “Share Exchange”).
 
On October 30, 2019, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Loyalty Preference Index, Inc. (“LPI”), we launched the LGBTQ100 ESG Index (or “LGBTQ100”) which references LGBTQ community survey data in the methodology for a benchmark listing of the nation’s highest financially performing companies that our respondents believe are most committed to advancing equality. In 2020, LPI was renamed to Advancing Equality Preference, Inc. (“AEP”)

Executive Summary
 
Starting in the first half of 2019, we assembled a highly accomplished Board of Directors recognized for their advocacy and impact in the area of LGBTQ diversity and inclusion (D&I) to create the first-ever impact preference financial Index listed on the NYSE. Our team collaborated with one of the top Index Analysts to create a methodology to utilize financial big data and AI-driven analytics. The goal is to drive financial alpha returns by creating a financial tool that will help break barriers by capturing the voice of the LGBTQ community constituent as participants in the creation of a ground-breaking thematic financial Index listed as LGBTQ100.
 
We recognized a gap in Index solutions within the growing category of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and how they measure a corporation’s compliance. We focused on LGBTQ diversity, inclusion and equality practices of leading corporations and specifically their commitment to advancing equality within the LGBTQ community. We found that these businesses were able to attract and retain the best talent and performed better in terms of earnings than their corporate peers. Our goal was to outperform other financial indices in terms of ROI and also outperform them in Return on Social Impact (ROSI); our endgame was to close the gap between companies and investors who measure their success purely around financial metrics along with companies that need to work harder to align with their equality driven constituents and improve their social equality policies and ESG compliance.
 
When we launched the LGBTQ100 on the New York Stock Exchange on October 30 of 2019, it became the first financial Index that embedded constituent preference data from the community including grading the top performing companies that have supported D&I, outwardly aligned their brand to support the LGBTQ community and screened well for ESG compliant practices.
 
The media reception and brand recognition achieved by the LGBTQ100 was extraordinary with expansive coverage by Bloomberg as well as other major financial outlets featuring how LGBTQ Loyalty Holdings had created and introduced the first impact preference index to achieve both financial performance and social impact. We are proud to report that our goal has been achieved with the LGBTQ100 outperforming the S&P 500 by over 2% since our listing on the NYSE and when back-tested over the past 11 years, our Index beats the S&P by over 20%.
 
Our focus in 2022 will be to build on this momentum and grow both revenues for our platform and Assets Under Management (AUM).
 
Business Overview
 
On January 25, 2019, we acquired LGBT Loyalty LLC, a New York limited liability company, with the goal of creating the first LGBTQ Loyalty Preference Index ETF (the “Index ETF”) to provide the LGBTQ community with the power to influence the allocation of capital within a financial Index ETF based upon LGBTQ consumer preferences. The Index ETF is intended to link the growing economic influence of the LGBTQ community and their allies with many of the top Fortune 500 companies that support and implement diversity, inclusion and equality policies within their organizations. The incorporation of diversity and inclusion in a company’s recruitment and human resource policies is becoming a key concern to investors as part of their growing focus on ESG allocations. Our data and analytics unequivocally reinforce that corporations that have embraced diversity and inclusion policies within their corporate culture perform at a higher level financially than their peers. This includes advancing a more invigorated workforce that attracts and retains the best talent. Innovation and agility have been identified as great benefits of diversity, and there is an increasing awareness of what has come to be known as ‘the power of difference’.
 
On October 30, 2019, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Advancing Equality Preference, Inc. (“AEP”) and our strategically aligned partnerships with crowd sourced data and analytic providers, we launched the LGBTQ100 ESG Index which integrates LGBTQ community survey data into the methodology for a benchmark listing of the nation’s highest financially performing large-cap publicly listed corporations that our respondents believe are most committed to advancing equality. LPI is the index provider for the LGBTQ + ESG100 ETF; LGBTQ Loyalty was the Sponsor for the prospectus that was filed by the highly regarded licensed Fund Adviser ProcureAM, a wholly owned subsidiary of Procure Holdings, LLC., which is through our platform service agreement (“PSA”), and was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in early January 2020. The LGBTQ + ESG100 ETF (the “Fund”) sought to track the investment results (before fees and expenses) of the LGBTQ100 ESG Index. The Fund earned management fees based on assets under management (“AUM”) and launched in Q3 - 2021 on the NASDAQ.


Fund Closure
 
On March 25, 2022, ProcureAM, LLC (“Adviser”), the adviser to the Fund, after consultation with the Company, the sponsor of the ETF, determined that the Fund should be closed. Based upon a recommendation by the Adviser, the Board of Trustees of Procure ETF Trust I (the “Trust”) has approved a Plan of Liquidation for the Fund under which the Fund will be liquidated on or about April 28, 2022 (the “Liquidation Date”). The Liquidation Date may be changed without notice at the discretion of the officers of the Trust. Beginning when the Fund commences the liquidation of its portfolio, the Fund will not pursue its investment objectives or, with certain exceptions, engage in normal business activities, and the Fund may hold cash and securities that may not be consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and strategy, which may adversely affect Fund performance.
 
LGBTQ Loyalty has generated an abundance of media coverage for our premier LGBTQ Index product with the launch and listing on NYSE of the LGBTQ100 ESG Index. The exclusive media launch with Bloomberg Media was instrumental in propelling the LGBTQ100 brand to center stage overnight in the financial sector. In addition, LGBTQ Loyalty was featured at the Inside ETFs Summit in early 2020 with Board Members, Barney Frank and Billy Bean speaking on the “The Power of Inclusion & Equality” for investors. Our media strategy objective is to lay the groundwork for additional high-profile positioning of the brand as we work to achieve the desired increased financial media coverage and growth in AUM valuation for our company and shareholders.

Our Products
 
Our mission is to build a sustainable and well recognized brand focused on unlocking the growing purchasing power of the LGTBQ community globally by offering a robust LGBTQ Index and core ETF portfolio that attracts key institutional investors and corporations.
 
At the nucleus of our LGBTQ Loyalty Preference Index is our partner-driven Crowd Preference Index Methodology (CPIM) which we believe disrupts ESG investing. This is achieved through an elevated screening process of financial performance data and ESG standards and practices, whereby LGBTQ community data on diversity and inclusion compliance directly impacts corporate financial results and transparently identifies and recognizes high performance companies who have consistently outperformed the S&P 500 index or equivalent sector standards and norms.
 
We intend to extend the LGBTQ Loyalty Index brand with future plans to develop indices with a focus on the ‘Social’ component of ESG utilizing our proprietary financial slogan of “Advancing Equality” within other gender, minority interest groups.
 
Revenue
 
The Company focus over the past few years was to create and launch our first of many financial Index products through an equality driven thematic ESG screened and alpha performance benchmark. The Company achieved this through its LGBTQ100 ESG Index listing and performance on the NYSE starting on October 30, 2019. In 2022 our collective efforts and focus is to monetize and scale our model by capturing recurring revenue streams through our current financial Index product. Our goal is to accelerate our revenue pursuits through our partnership and licensed relationships to achieve a break-even point when we have secured AUM benchmarked against the LGBTQ100 Index in excess of $50,000,000.
 
We intend to introduce a new key partnered revenue source derived from Direct Index Licensing Fees generated by financial institutions and asset management companies for creating a product (e.g., Index Funds, Structured Financial Products, Turnkey Asset Management Providers) based on or linked to the LGBTQ100 index. This includes fees to use the LGBTQ100 index to track the performance of funds or as benchmarks for actively managed portfolios. We plan to capture Data Subscriptions which could provide recurring subscription revenue from our LGBTQ Index. This includes ongoing and historical data and information generated by our wholly owned division Advancing Equality Preference Inc., and through our strategic partnerships for new potential financial equality-driven Indices.

New initiatives in 2022 include a plan to create ancillary revenue streams to complement and support this unique platform for the top 100 Equality driven Corporations in America represented in the LGBTQ100 Index. We believe our index will reward and elevate the status of those corporations that have adopted diversity and inclusion best practices, cared for their employees and positively impacted LGBTQ communities. Expert LGBTQ economists have repeatedly stressed the value of the LGBTQ brand loyalty to corporations. We consider the companies that best capture the spending trends and loyalty of the LGBTQ consumer will be better positioned for financial growth and success. Given the opportunity to link to the power and status generated between the LGBTQ community, these companies and their own workforce, we will launch a Partner Loyalty Program which includes benefits afforded to defined sponsorship tiers.
 
Our initial investments in creating a high performing product with a well-recognized brand have been established. As we begin to move into planning for the post-COVID-19 world, we will now shift our efforts to cultivate new revenue stream opportunities while building AUM as we construct a profitable business platform.
 
We have achieved no revenues to date from our LGBTQ related operations and have been focused on building our product and achieving performance results and media branding over the course of the past twelve months. There are no assurances that can be given that we will achieve revenues or profitability in the future.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is targeted to the estimated three trillion-dollar global purchasing power of the LGBTQ consumer demographic. More than nineteen million people identify themselves as LGBTQ in the US and four-hundred-fifty million globally while the LGBTQ community is composed of some of the most loyalty driven consumers in the world.
 
We believe that the LGBTQ demographic is one of the most highly sought-after economic groups in the world from corporate America down to the local business owner because of their higher median income and brand loyalty. What makes targeting and supporting this dynamic demographic even more extraordinary and rewarding is that friends, family, employers, employees, teachers, coaches and fans of our community so loyally support the brands, products and services that in turn support us. We further believe that this loyalty across the board is time tested, proven, growing and expanding and ultimately extremely rewarding to all that are embraced by the LGBTQ community. Connecting the world’s most supportive LGBTQ companies to the dynamic, loyal and ever-increasing spending power of the LGBTQ community is a consequential step forward for the LGBTQ movement and investment community.
 
Many Fortune 500 companies are directing more of their consumer advertising and promotional spend towards celebrating diversity and equality. Our long-term goal is to reinforce the financial performance of those Corporations as they foster and integrate LGBTQ equality practices through their Diversity and Inclusion policies as a cornerstone of their corporate culture. Our LGBTQ100 Index of the top 100 corporate constituents have already embraced and enacted this standard of Equality excellence. See our top LGBTQ100 Index constituents on our website.

Competition
 
We created the first-ever LGBTQ Loyalty Preference Index. We have identified Pride Performance & Holdings issuer UBS, an entity which gives individuals an opportunity to invest in companies that support equality in the workplace for their lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees, as a competitor. However, Pride Performance appears to focus mainly on the hiring of LGBTQ individuals and we do not see this as direct competition as our Index will be created through surveying and preferencing the top companies in the S&P 500 that best support and align with the LGBTQ community. To date no other financial index provider has focused on including the feedback from direct constituents in constructing an Index methodology that empowers the voice of the LGBTQ community.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of domestic laws and regulations that affect our business. Not only are these laws constantly evolving, which could result in them being interpreted in ways that could harm our business, but legislation is also continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution.
 
Further, because our services are available worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.
