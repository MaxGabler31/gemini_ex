General

We are engaged primarily in two business segments: movie theatres and hotels and resorts.
 As of December 28, 2017, our theatre operations included 69 movie theatres with 895 screens throughout Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and Ohio, including two movie theatres with 11 screens in Wisconsin and Nebraska owned by third parties and managed by us. We also operate a family entertainment center, Funset Boulevard, that is adjacent to one of our theatres in Appleton, Wisconsin, and own the Ronnie’s Plaza retail outlet in St. Louis, Missouri, an 84,000 square foot retail center featuring 21 shops and other businesses to which we lease retail space. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are the 4th largest theatre circuit in the United States.
 As of December 28, 2017, our hotels and resorts operations included eight wholly-owned or majority-owned and operated hotels and resorts in Wisconsin, Illinois, Nebraska and Oklahoma. We also managed 10 hotels, resorts and other properties for third parties in Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina and Texas. As of December 28, 2017, we owned or managed approximately 4,841 hotel and resort rooms.
 Both of these business segments are discussed in detail below. For information regarding the revenues, operating income or loss, assets and certain other financial information of these segments for the last three full fiscal years and for our Transition Period ended December 31, 2015, please see our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Note 12 in Part II below.

Fiscal Year
 In October 2015, we elected to change our fiscal year from the last Thursday in May to the last Thursday in December. As a result, on March 15, 2016, we filed a Transition Report on Form 10-K for the transition period beginning on May 29, 2015 and ended December 31, 2015, which we refer to in this Annual Report as the “Transition Period.” We refer in this Annual Report to the period beginning on December 30, 2016 and ended December 28, 2017 as “fiscal 2017.” We refer in this Annual Report to the period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ended December 29, 2016 as “fiscal 2016.” We refer in this Annual Report to the period beginning on May 30, 2014 and ended on May 28, 2015 as “fiscal 2015,” and the period beginning on May 31, 2013 and ended on May 29, 2014 as “fiscal 2014.” In this Annual Report, we compare (1) audited financial results for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016; (2) financial results for fiscal 2016, which are audited, with the financial results for the 53-week period ended December 31, 2015, which are unaudited; (3) financial results for the Transition Period, which are audited, with financial results for the 30-week period ended December 25, 2014, which are unaudited; and (4) as applicable, audited financial results for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014.
Strategic Plans
 Please see our discussion under “Current Plans” in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 Theatre Operations
 At the end of fiscal 2017, we owned or operated 69 movie theatre locations with a total of 895 screens in Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and Ohio. We averaged 13.0 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2017, compared to 13.0 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2016, 12.6 screens per location at the end of the Transition Period, and 12.4 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2015. Included in the fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, Transition Period and fiscal 2015 totals are two theatres with 11 screens that we manage for other owners. Our 67 company-owned facilities include 47 megaplex theatres (12 or more screens), representing approximately 80% of our total screens, 19 multiplex theatres (two to 11 screens) and one single-screen theatre. At the end of fiscal 2017, we operated 866 first-run screens, 11 of which we operated under management contracts, and 29 budget-oriented screens.
 We invested over $275 million to further enhance the movie-going experience and amenities in new and existing theatres over the last four and one-half calendar years, with more investments planned for fiscal 2018. These investments include:
 New theatres. Late in our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, we opened a theatre in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, the Marcus Palace Cinema. Replacing an existing nearby theatre in Madison, Wisconsin, this new 12-screen theatre has exceeded our expectations, and we opened two additional screens at this location during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. In April 2017, we opened our new 10-screen Southbridge Crossing Cinema in Shakopee, Minnesota. This state-of-the-art theatre includes DreamLoungerSM recliner seating in every auditorium, two UltraScreen DLX® auditoriums, a Zaffiro’s® Express and a Take FiveSM Lounge. On June 30, 2017, we opened our first stand-alone all in-theatre dining location, branded BistroPlexSM, in Greendale, Wisconsin. This new theatre features eight in-theatre dining auditoriums with DreamLounger recliners, including two SuperScreen DLX® auditoriums, plus a separate full-service Take Five Lounge. We have announced plans to further expand this concept, including a new location in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Construction is expected to begin on this new location in 2018. In addition, we are looking for additional sites for potential new theatre locations in both new and existing markets. 
  3

 
Theatre acquisitions. We believe acquisitions of existing theatres or theatre circuits is also a viable growth strategy for us. In April 2016, we purchased a closed 16-screen theatre in Country Club Hills, Illinois, which is now our sixth theatre in the greater Chicago area, building on our strong presence in the Chicago southern suburbs. The purchase was part of an Internal Revenue Code §1031 like-kind exchange in which the tax gain from our October 2015 sale of the real estate related to the Hotel Phillips was deferred by reinvesting the applicable proceeds in replacement real estate within a prescribed time period. We opened the newly renovated theatre early in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The renovation added DreamLounger recliner seating to all auditoriums, added one UltraScreen DLX auditorium and two SuperScreen DLX auditoriums, as well as a Take Five Lounge and Reel Sizzle® outlet. In December 2016, we acquired the assets of Wehrenberg Theatres® (which we refer to as Wehrenberg or Marcus Wehrenberg), a family-owned and operated theatre circuit based in St. Louis, Missouri with 197 screens at 14 locations in Missouri, Iowa, Illinois and Minnesota. This acquisition increased our total number of screens by 29%. The movie theatre industry is very fragmented, with approximately 50% of United States screens owned by the three largest theatre circuits and the other 50% owned by approximately 800 smaller operators, making it very difficult to predict when acquisition opportunities may arise. We have engaged third-party assistance to actively help us seek additional acquisitions in the future. We do not believe that we are geographically constrained, and we believe that we may be able to add value to certain theatres through our various proprietary amenities and operating expertise.
 DreamLounger recliner additions. These luxurious, state-of-the-art recliners allow guests to go from upright to a full-recline position in seconds. These seat changes require full auditorium remodels to accommodate the necessary 84 inches of legroom, resulting in the loss of approximately 50% of the existing traditional seats in an average auditorium. To date, the addition of DreamLoungers has significantly increased attendance at each of our applicable theatres, outperforming nearby competitive theatres as well as growing the overall market attendance in most cases. In addition to the two new theatres described above, we added DreamLounger recliner seats to 15 more theatres during fiscal 2017 (including six Marcus Wehrenberg theatres). As a result, as of December 28, 2017, we offered all DreamLounger recliner seating in 39 theatres, representing approximately 61% of our company-owned, first-run theatres (including the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres). Including our premium, large format (PLF) auditoriums with recliner seating, as of December 28, 2017, we offered our DreamLounger recliner seating in approximately 65% of our company-owned, first-run screens (including the Marcus Wehrenberg screens), a percentage we believe to be the highest among the largest theatre chains in the nation. Currently, seven Marcus Wehrenberg theatres offer recliner seating in all of its auditoriums. We are currently completing the addition of DreamLounger recliner seats to three more theatres (including two Marcus Wehrenberg theatres) and evaluating opportunities to add our DreamLounger premium seating to five to seven additional theatres during the second half of fiscal 2018, including two Marcus Wehrenberg theatres. As a result, by the end of fiscal 2018, our percentage of total company-owned, first-run screens with DreamLounger recliner seating may be more than 75%.
 UltraScreen DLX and SuperScreen DLX (DreamLounger eXperience) conversions. We introduced one of the first PLF presentations to the industry when we rolled out our proprietary UltraScreen® concept in 1999. During fiscal 2014, we introduced our UltraScreen DLX concept by combining our premium, large-format presentation with DreamLounger recliner seating and Dolby® Atmos™ immersive sound to elevate the movie-going experience for our guests. During fiscal 2017, we opened two new UltraScreen DLX auditoriums at our new theatre in Minnesota and two new SuperScreen DLX auditoriums at our new BistroPlex theatre in Wisconsin, completed conversion of two traditional UltraScreens and one existing Wehrenberg-branded PLF screen to UltraScreen DLX auditoriums at existing theatres in Wisconsin and Missouri, and converted 16 additional screens to SuperScreen DLX auditoriums at ten existing theatres in six states (including 11 Marcus Wehrenberg screens). Several of our new PLF screens in fiscal 2017 included the added feature of heated DreamLounger recliner seats. As of December 28, 2017, we had 28 UltraScreen DLX auditoriums, one traditional UltraScreen auditorium and 43 SuperScreen DLX auditoriums (a slightly smaller screen than an UltraScreen but with the same DreamLounger seating and Dolby Atmos sound) at our theatre locations. Three of the acquired Marcus Wehrenberg theatres feature IMAX® PLF screens. We currently offer at least one PLF screen in approximately 69% of our first-run, company-owned theatres (including the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres) – once again a percentage we believe to be the highest percentage among the largest theatre chains in the nation. Our PLF screens generally have higher per-screen revenues and draw customers from a larger geographic region compared to our standard screens, and we charge a premium price to our guests for this experience. We are currently evaluating opportunities to convert two additional screens at two existing theatres to UltraScreen DLX and SuperScreen DLX auditoriums during fiscal 2018, in addition to two new UltraScreen DLX auditoriums planned for a third existing theatre.

Signature cocktail and dining concepts. We have continued to further enhance our food and beverage offerings within our existing theatres. We believe our 50-plus years of food and beverage experience in the hotel and restaurant businesses provides us with a unique advantage and expertise that we can leverage to further grow revenues in our theatres. The concepts we are expanding include:
 
i | Take Five Lounge and Take Five Express – these full-service bars offer an inviting atmosphere and a chef-inspired dining menu, along with a complete selection of cocktails, locally-brewed beers and wines. We opened five new Take Five Lounge outlets in fiscal 2017, including two outlets opened at new theatres described above. In addition, two Marcus Wehrenberg theatres offer a lounge concept, one of which was converted to a Take Five Lounge during fiscal 2017. As of December 28, 2017, we offered bars at 26 theatres, representing approximately 41% of our company-owned, first-run theatres (including the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres). We are currently evaluating opportunities to add bar service to additional theatres during fiscal 2018.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i | Zaffiro’s Express – these outlets offer lobby dining that includes appetizers, sandwiches, salads, desserts and our signature Zaffiro’s THINCREDIBLE® handmade thin-crust pizza. In select locations without a Take Five Lounge outlet, we offer beer and wine at the Zaffiro’s Express outlet. We opened four new Zaffiro’s Express outlets during fiscal 2017, increasing our number of theatres with this concept to 26 as of December 28, 2017, representing approximately 41% of our company-owned, first-run theatres (including the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres). We also operate three Zaffiro’s Pizzeria and Bar full-service restaurants. We are currently evaluating opportunities to add two additional Zaffiro’s Express outlets during fiscal 2018.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i | Reel Sizzle – our newest signature dining concept serves menu items inspired by classic Hollywood and the iconic diners of the 1950s. We offer Americana fare like burgers and chicken sandwiches prepared on a griddle behind the counter, along with chicken tenders, crinkle cut fries, ice cream and signature shakes. As of December 28, 2017, we operated seven Reel Sizzle outlets, including two that we opened during fiscal 2017, and we are evaluating additional opportunities to add Reel Sizzle outlets to existing theatres in the future.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i | We also operate one Hollywood Café at an existing theatre and four of the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres offer in-lobby dining concepts, operating under names such as Fred’s Drive-In or Five Star. Including these additional concepts, as of December 28, 2017, we offered one or more in-lobby dining concepts in 36 theatres, representing approximately 56% of our company-owned, first-run theatres (including the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i | Big Screen Bistro – this concept offers full-service, in-theatre dining with a complete menu of drinks and chef-prepared salads, sandwiches, entrées and desserts. Including two Marcus Wehrenberg theatres that had proprietary in-theatre dining concepts converted to Big Screen Bistro concepts during fiscal 2017, one Marcus Wehrenberg theatre offering in-theatre dining under the name Five Star and the eight-screen new BistroPlex theatre described above, we currently offer in-theatre dining at ten theatres in 37 total auditoriums (including one theatre and five screens managed for another owner), representing approximately 14% of our company-owned, first-run theatres (including the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres). We will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to expand our in-theatre dining concepts in the future.

We rolled out a “$5 Tuesday” promotion at every theatre in our circuit in mid-November 2013. Coupled with a free 44-oz popcorn for everyone for the first five months of the program (subsequently offered only to our loyalty program members) and an aggressive marketing campaign, our goal was to increase overall attendance by reaching mid-week value customers who may have reduced their movie-going frequency or stopped going to the movies because of price. We have seen our Tuesday attendance increase dramatically since the introduction of the $5 Tuesday promotion. We believe this promotion has created another “weekend” day for us, without adversely impacting the movie-going habits of our regular weekend customers. The newly-acquired Wehrenberg theatres previously offered a discounted price on Tuesday nights, but we immediately introduced our $5 Tuesday promotion with the free popcorn for loyalty members upon acquiring the theatres and have experienced an increase in Tuesday performance at these theatres as a result. We also offer a “$6 Student Thursday” promotion at 36 locations that has been well received by that particular customer segment.
 We launched a new, what we believe to be best-in-class, customer loyalty program called Magical Movie RewardsSM on March 30, 2014. Designed to enhance the movie-going experience for our customers, the response to this program has exceeded our expectations. We currently have approximately 2.6 million members enrolled in the program. Approximately 45% of all transactions in our theatres during fiscal 2017 were completed by registered members of the loyalty program. The program allows members to earn points for each dollar spent and access special offers available only to members. The rewards are redeemable at the box office, concession stand or at the many Marcus Theatres food and beverage venues. In addition, we have partnered with Movio, a global leader in data analysis for the cinema industry, to allow more targeted communication with our loyalty members. The software provides us with insight into customer preferences, attendance habits and general demographics, which will help us deliver customized communication to our members. In turn, members of this program can enjoy and plan for a more personalized movie-going experience. The program also gives us the ability to cost effectively promote non-traditional programming and special events, particularly during non-peak time periods. We believe that this will result in increased movie-going frequency, more frequent visits to the concession stand, increased loyalty to Marcus Theatres and ultimately, improved operating results. The acquired Wehrenberg theatres offered a loyalty program to their customers that had approximately 200,000 members. We converted these members to our Magical Movie Rewards program during fiscal 2017.
 We have enhanced our mobile ticketing capabilities and added the Magical Movie Rewards loyalty program to our downloadable Marcus Theatres mobile application. We have redesigned our marcustheatres.com website and continued to install additional theatre-level technology, such as new ticketing kiosks and digital menu boards and concession advertising monitors. Each of these enhancements is designed to improve customer interactions, both at the theatre and through mobile platforms and other electronic devices.
 The addition of digital technology throughout our circuit (we offer digital cinema projection on 100% of our first-run screens) has provided us with additional opportunities to obtain non-motion picture programming from other new and existing content providers, including live and pre-recorded performances of the Metropolitan Opera, as well as sports, music and other events, at many of our locations. We offer weekday alternate programming at many of our theatres across our circuit. The special programming includes classic movies, live performances, comedy shows and children’s performances. We believe this type of programming is more impactful when presented on the big screen and provides an opportunity to continue to expand our audience base beyond traditional moviegoers.

Revenues for the theatre business, and the motion picture industry in general, are heavily dependent on the general audience appeal of available films, together with studio marketing, advertising and support campaigns, factors over which we have no control. Consistent with prior periods in which blockbusters accounted for a significant portion of our total box office receipts, our top 15 performing films accounted for 41% of our fiscal 2017 box office receipts, compared to 43% during fiscal 2016. The following five fiscal 2017 films accounted for nearly 20% of our total box office and produced the greatest box office receipts for our circuit: Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, It and Wonder Woman.
 We obtain our films from several national motion picture production and distribution companies, and we are not dependent on any single motion picture supplier. Our booking, advertising, concession purchases and promotional activities are handled centrally by our administrative staff.
 We strive to provide our movie patrons with high-quality picture and sound presentation in clean, comfortable, attractive and contemporary theatre environments. All of our movie theatre complexes feature digital cinema technology; either digital sound, Dolby or other stereo sound systems; acoustical ceilings; side wall insulation; engineered drapery folds to eliminate sound imbalance, reverberation and distortion; tiled floors; cup-holder chair-arms; and computer-controlled heating, air conditioning and ventilation. We offer stadium seating, a tiered seating system that permits unobstructed viewing, at substantially all of our first-run screens. Computerized box offices permit all of our movie theatres to sell tickets in advance. Our theatres are accessible to persons with disabilities and provide wireless headphones for hearing-impaired moviegoers. Other amenities at certain theatres include touch-screen, computerized, self-service ticket kiosks, which simplify advance ticket purchases. We have an agreement to allow moviegoers to buy tickets on Fandango, the largest online ticket-seller. We have enhanced our web site and our mobile ticketing capabilities and added the Magical Movie Rewards loyalty program to our downloadable Marcus Theatres mobile application.
 We have a master license agreement with a subsidiary of Cinedigm Digital Cinema Corp. to deploy digital cinema systems in the majority of our company-owned theatre locations. Under the terms of the agreement, Cinedigm’s subsidiary purchased the digital projection systems and licensed them to us under a long-term arrangement. The costs to deploy this new technology are being covered primarily through the payment of virtual print fees from studios to our selected implementation company, Cinedigm. Our goals from digital cinema included delivering an improved film presentation to our guests, increasing scheduling flexibility, providing a platform for additional 3D presentations as needed, as well as maximizing the opportunities for alternate programming that may be available with this technology. As of December 28, 2017, we had the ability to offer digital 3D presentations in 259, or approximately 31%, of our first-run screens, including the vast majority of our UltraScreens. We have the ability to increase the number of digital 3D capable screens we offer to our guests in the future as needed, based on the number of digital 3D films anticipated to be released during future periods and our customers’ response to these 3D releases.
 We sell food and beverage concessions in all of our movie theatres. We believe that a wide variety of food and beverage items, properly merchandised, increases concession revenue per patron. Although popcorn and soda remain the traditional favorites with moviegoers, we continue to upgrade our available concessions by offering varied choices. For example, some of our theatres offer hot dogs, pizza, ice cream, pretzel bites, frozen yogurt, coffee, mineral water and juices. We have also added self-serve soft drink dispensers and grab-and-go candy, frozen treat and bottled drink kiosks to many of our theatres. In recent years, we have added signature cocktail and dining concepts as described above. The response to our new food and beverage offerings has been positive, and we have plans to expand these food and beverage concepts at additional locations in the future.
 We have a variety of ancillary revenue sources in our theatres, with the largest related to the sale of pre-show and lobby advertising (through our current advertising provider, Screenvision). We also obtain ancillary revenues from corporate and group meeting sales, sponsorships, internet surcharge fees and alternate auditorium uses. We continue to pursue additional strategies to increase our ancillary revenue sources.

We also own a family entertainment center, Funset Boulevard, adjacent to our 14-screen movie theatre in Appleton, Wisconsin. Funset Boulevard features a 40,000 square foot Hollywood-themed indoor amusement facility that includes a restaurant, party room, laser tag center, virtual reality games, arcade, outdoor miniature golf course and batting cages.
 In connection with the Wehrenberg acquisition, we also acquired the Ronnie’s Plaza retail outlet in St. Louis, Missouri, an 84,000 square foot retail center featuring 21 shops and other businesses to which we lease retail space.

Managed Hotels, Resorts and Other Properties
 We also manage hotels, resorts and other properties for third parties, typically under long-term management agreements. Revenues from these management contracts may include both base management fees, often in the form of a fixed percentage of defined revenues, and incentive management fees, typically calculated based upon defined profit performance. We may also earn fees for technical and preopening services before a property opens, as well as for ongoing accounting and technology services.
 We manage the Crowne Plaza-Northstar Hotel in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Crowne Plaza-Northstar Hotel is located in downtown Minneapolis and has 222 guest rooms, 12 meeting rooms, 10,000 square feet of meeting space, an outdoor Skygarden for group events, a restaurant, a cocktail lounge and an exercise facility.
 We manage The Garland hotel in North Hollywood, California. The Garland hotel has 255 recently renovated guest rooms, including 12 suites, meeting space for up to 600, including an amphitheater and ballroom, an outdoor swimming pool and lighted tennis courts.

We manage the Heidel House Resort & Spa in Green Lake, Wisconsin. The resort features 190 full-service rooms and is located on 20 wooded acres on the shore of Green Lake, near Ripon, Wisconsin. The resort has an award-winning spa, three restaurants, two lounges, an ice cream parlor, a 380-guest ballroom, an outdoor space for weddings, indoor and outdoor pools, a beach, a boat rental area, hiking and biking trails, as well as a yacht available for daily excursions.

 In 2015, we became a 10% minority investor and manager of the new Omaha Marriott Downtown at The Capitol District hotel, which opened in August 2017. The 333-room, 12-story full service hotel serves as an anchor for the Capitol District, an upscale urban destination dining and entertainment community in downtown Omaha. The development also includes 218 luxury residential apartments, office space, a parking garage and retail space for restaurants, shops and entertainment. It also features a plaza for events and concerts.
 In September 2017, we assumed management of the Sheraton Chapel Hill Hotel in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The Sheraton Chapel Hill Hotel is located in the Triangle region of North Carolina and features 168 guestrooms and suites, 16,000 square feet of flexible meeting space, an on-site restaurant, fitness center, seasonal outdoor pool and sun deck and local shuttle service.
 In January 2018, we assumed management of the newly-opened Murieta Inn and Spa in Rancho Murieta, California. Found within the development containing the renowned Murieta Equestrian Center, the largest equestrian facility in California, the 83-room hotel features The Gate, a one-of-a-kind restaurant and bar that offers fresh, seasonal menus using ingredients from the hotel’s five-acre farm and state-of-the-art greenhouse.

 We also manage two condominium hotels under long-term management contracts. Revenues from these management contracts are larger than typical management contracts because, under an agreed-upon rental pool arrangement, room revenues are shared at a defined percentage with individual condominium owners. In addition, we own all of the common areas of these facilities, including all restaurants, lounges, spas and gift shops, and retain all of the revenues from these outlets.
 We manage the Timber Ridge Lodge, an indoor/outdoor water park and condominium complex in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

WHLS provides commercial laundry services for our hotel and resort properties in Wisconsin and for other unaffiliated hotels in the Midwest. WHLS currently processes over 10 million pounds of linen each year, and the expansion is expected to enable WHLS to double its current capacity within the next five years. WHLS has been a leader in commercial laundry services for the hospitality industry in the Midwest for over 20 years.
 In October 2015, we completed the sale of the Hotel Phillips, a 217-room historic, landmark hotel in Kansas City, Missouri, which we had previously successfully owned and operated for 14 years.

 In 2017, we were awarded the Service Excellence Award by Governor Scott Walker at the Wisconsin Governor’s Conference on Tourism, which took place March 12-14, 2017 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Service Excellence Award honors a Wisconsin business that has achieved significant success and growth by providing exceptional service to its customers and a strong, charitable involvement in its community. Marcus Hotels & Resorts received the award for its ongoing commitment to supporting Wisconsin charities and tourism-driven amenities. Last year, associates of The Marcus Corporation and Marcus Hotels & Resorts volunteered more than 28,000 hours in their local communities.
 We have taken our highly-regarded web development team and created a new business unit to be managed by the hotels and resorts division called Graydient Creative. Graydient leverages our expertise in digital marketing, creating a new profit center for the division by seeking new external customers. Services provided by Graydient include, but are not limited to, website design and development, branding and print design, and social media management.
 Competition

Both of our businesses experience intense competition from national, regional and local chain and franchise operations, some of which have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we have.  Most of our facilities are located in close proximity to competing facilities.
 
Our movie theatres compete with large national movie theatre operators, such as AMC Entertainment, Cinemark and Regal Cinemas, as well as with a wide array of smaller first-run exhibitors.  Movie exhibitors also face competition from a number of other movie exhibition delivery systems, such as digital downloads, video-on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs and network and syndicated television.  We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the public’s leisure time and disposable income. 
 
Our hotels and resorts compete with the hotels and resorts operated and/or franchised by Hyatt Corporation, Marriott Corporation, Hilton Worldwide and others, along with other regional and local hotels and resorts.  Increasingly, we also face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry, such as peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms, such as Airbnb and HomeAway.  We compete for hotel management agreements with a wide variety of national, regional and local management companies based upon many factors, including the value and quality of our management services, our reputation, our ability and willingness to invest our capital in joint venture projects, the level of our management fees and our relationships with property owners and investors.
 
We believe that the principal factors of competition in both of our businesses, in varying degrees, are the price and quality of the product, quality and location of our facilities and customer service.  We believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of these factors.

Seasonality
 
Due to our change to a December fiscal year end, we expect our quarterly results to be more consistent between quarters than they were in the past and our results for the last two years under the new calendar have met those expectations. Our first fiscal quarter will likely produce the weakest operating results in our hotels and resorts division due primarily to the effects of reduced travel during the winter months. We expect our second and third fiscal quarters to often produce our strongest operating results because these periods coincide with the typical summer seasonality of the movie theatre industry and the summer strength of the lodging business. Due to the fact that the week between Christmas and New Year’s Eve is historically one of the strongest weeks of the year for our theatre division, we expect that the specific timing of the last Thursday in December will have an impact on the results of our fiscal first and fourth quarters in that division, particularly when we have a 53-week year.
Environmental Regulation
 Federal, state and local environmental legislation has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, our activities in acquiring and selling real estate for business development purposes have been complicated by the continued emphasis that our personnel must place on properly analyzing real estate sites for potential environmental problems. This circumstance has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, greater time and increased costs involved in acquiring and selling properties associated with our various businesses.
