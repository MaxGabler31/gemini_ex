  Item 1. Business
 
  General
 
 We are an international renewable fuels and biochemicals company focused on the production of advanced renewable fuels and chemicals through the acquisition, development, and commercialization of innovative technologies that replace traditional petroleum-based products through the conversion of first-generation ethanol and biodiesel plants into advanced biorefineries. We operate in two reportable geographic segments: “North America” and “India.” For revenue and other information regarding our operating segments, see Note 11- Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
  We were incorporated in Nevada in 2006.
 
 We own and operate a 60 million gallon per year ethanol production facility located in Keyes, California (the Keyes plant or Keyes facility). The facility produces its own combined heat and power through the use of a natural gas-powered steam turbine, and reuses 100% of its process water with zero water discharge. In addition to ethanol, the Keyes plant produces Wet Distillers Grains (WDG), Distillers Corn Oil (DCO), and Condensed Distillers Solubles or corn syrup (CDS), all of which are sold to local dairies and feedlots as animal feed. The primary feedstock used for the production of low carbon renewable fuel ethanol at the Keyes facility is number #2 yellow dent corn. The corn is procured by J.D. Heiskell from various Midwestern grain facilities and shipped, via Union Pacific Rail Road, to an unloading facility adjacent to the Keyes plant.

 We also lease a site in Riverbank, CA, near the Keyes plant, where we plan to utilize biomass-to-fuel technology that we have licensed from LanzaTech Technology (“LanzaTech”) and InEnTec Technology (“InEnTec”) to build a cellulosic ethanol production facility (the Riverbank Cellulosic Ethanol Facility) capable of converting local California surplus biomass – principally agricultural waste – into ultra-low carbon renewable cellulosic ethanol. The Riverbank Cellulosic Ethanol Facility plans to utilize the existing distillation and logistics infrastructure at our nearby Keyes plant. By producing ultra-low carbon intensity renewable cellulosic fuel ethanol, we expect to capture higher value D3 cellulosic renewable identification numbers (RINs) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) carbon credits. Renewable fuels such as corn-based ethanol (D6 RIN) and cellulosic-based ethanol (D3 RIN) receive a higher price in the marketplace when RINs and LCFS incentives are sold with the renewable fuel based on the unique carbon score attributed to the plant generating the fuel. D3 RINs have a higher value in the marketplace than D6 RINs due to D3 RINs’ relative scarcity.
 
 During 2017, Goodland Advanced Fuels, Inc., (GAFI) was formed to acquire land, buildings and process equipment in Goodland, Kansas. At acquisition, the assets were valued at $15.4 million and provide a base for the construction and development of a next generation biofuel facility. GAFI entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Third Eye Capital Corporation. GAFI, the Company and its subsidiary Aemetis Advanced Product Keyes (AAPK) also entered into separate Intercompany Revolving Notes, pursuant to which GAFI may lend a portion of the proceeds of the Revolving Loan under the Note Purchase Agreement. Aemetis has the power to direct the activities of GAFI and has future plans to apply cellulosic ethanol technology to the partially completed Goodland plant.
 
 We also own and operate a biodiesel production facility in Kakinada, India (the Kakinada plant) with a nameplate capacity of 150,000 metric tons per year, which is equal to about 50 million gallons per year. We believe this facility is one of the largest biodiesel production facilities in India on a nameplate capacity basis. The Kakinada plant is capable of processing a variety of vegetable oil and animal fat waste feedstocks into biodiesel that meet international product standards. The Kakinada Plant also distills the crude glycerin byproduct from the biodiesel refining process into refined glycerin, and sells the valuable lubricant into the pharmaceutical, lotions, paint, adhesive and other industries. Our objective is to continue to capitalize on the substantial growth potential of the biodiesel industry in India and address established markets in the European Union (EU) and United States of America (U.S.) by leveraging relationships with a large oil company and trading partners.
 
  Strategy
 
 Key elements of our strategy include:
 
  North America
 
 Leverage technology for the development and production of additional advanced biofuels and renewable chemicals. We hold the exclusive rights to the LanzaTech Technology and InEnTec Technology for the conversion of surplus agricultural waste, forest waste, dairy waste, and construction and demolition waste into ultra-low carbon renewable fuel referred to in the biofuels industry as “cellulosic ethanol”. We intend to utilize this technology to produce cellulosic ethanol from central California agricultural biomass waste abundantly available from end-of-life orchard debris or nutshells. We have initiated a project to adopt the LanzaTech Technology and the InEnTec Technology at the Riverbank Cellulosic Ethanol Facility. Our first phase has an estimated eight million gallons per year name-plate capacity. We intend to expand the site to an estimated 32 million gallons per year name-plate capacity production plant. We also plan on licensing the technologies deployed at the Keyes Cellulosic Ethanol Facility to other existing California-based ethanol plants. In addition, we continue to evaluate new technology and develop technology under our existing patents, patent pending and in-process research and development to produce renewable chemicals and advanced fuels from renewable feedstocks. Our objective is to continue to commercialize our portfolio of technologies and expand the adoption of these advanced biofuels and bio-chemicals technologies throughout the United States.
 
 Diversify and expand revenue and cash flow by continuing to develop and adopt value-added by-product processing systems and optimize other processing systems in our existing plants. In April 2012, we installed a distillers corn oil (DCO) extraction unit at the Keyes plant and began extracting corn oil for sale into the livestock feed market. During 2014, we installed a second oil extraction system to further improve corn oil yields from this process. During 2017, we entered into agreements to sell substantially all of the carbon dioxide (CO2) produced at the Keyes plant to a leading industrial gas supplier who is building a liquid CO2 capture plant adjacent to the Keyes plant. We continue to evaluate and, as allowed by available financing and free cash flow from operations, adopt additional value-added processes that increase the value of the ethanol, distillers grain, corn oil and CO2 produced at the Keyes plant.

 Acquire, license our technologies to, or joint venture with other ethanol and biodiesel plants. There are approximately 200 operating ethanol plants and one hundred biodiesel plants in the U.S., as well as plants in Brazil, Argentina, India and elsewhere in the world, that could be upgraded to expand revenues and improve their cash flow using technology commercially deployed or licensed by us. After developing and commercially demonstrating technologies at the Keyes and/or Kakinada plants, we will evaluate on an opportunistic basis the benefit of acquiring ownership stake in other biofuel production facilities and entering into joint venture or licensing agreements with other ethanol, renewable diesel or renewable jet fuel facilities.
 
 Evaluate and pursue technology acquisition opportunities. We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire technologies and processes that result in accretive value opportunities as financial resources and business prospects make the acquisition of these technologies advisable. In addition, we may also seek to acquire companies, or enter into licensing agreements or form joint ventures with companies that offer prospects for the adoption of technologies that would be accretive to earnings.
 
  India
 
 Capitalize on recent policy changes by the Government of India, particularly those reducing the subsidies on diesel, reducing unfair taxation of feedstock, reducing restrictions on sales of fuel into the transportation markets, and promoting the use of renewable transportation fuels. We plan to continue to pursue the traditional bulk and transportation biodiesel markets in India, which may become more economically attractive as a result of potential changes to government tax structures and policies. With the rationalization of indirect taxation by the introduction of Goods and Services Tax, business to government Oil Marketing Company contracts and contracts with major oil consumers will become more readily available.
 
 Continue to develop international markets. We expect to increase sales by selling our biodiesel into international markets, principally by building relationships with major oil companies and trading partners. During 2014, we completed the construction of a biodiesel distillation column, which allows us to produce high-quality biodiesel that meets European Union standards. We have the necessary certifications to meet the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) standard, which allows us access to European markets for export of our biodiesel products. During 2015, we obtained the pathway certification to import biodiesel into California. In 2016, the European Commission adopted a list of new product categories originating in GSP (Generalized System of Preferences) beneficiary countries where GSP tariff preferences will be suspended from January 1, 2017 until December 31, 2019. Our distilled biodiesel falls within the category that provides at least a 6.5% tariff suspension beginning January 2017. In July 2017, India's Goods and Services Tax (GST) raised the combined tax rate from 11% to 18% on our sales into the Indian domestic markets, and then subsequently lowered the tax to 12% in early 2018. The temporary GST tax increase hampered domestic India revenue expansion for a large portion of 2017 and caused lower margins. On January 25, 2018, legislation reduced the GST from 18% to 12%, which has the potential to positively impact our revenues and margins in 2018.
 
 Diversify our feedstocks from India and international sources. We designed our Kakinada plant with the capability to produce biodiesel from multiple feedstocks. In 2009, we began to produce biodiesel from non-refined palm oil (NRPO). During 2014, we further diversified our feedstock with the introduction of animal oils and fats, which we used for the production of biodiesel to be sold into the European markets. In 2016 and 2017, we used refined, bleached & deodorized Palm Stearin (RBD Palm Stearin), which is derived from refining palm oil from crude and was imported from Indonesia. Additionally, the Kakinada plant is capable of producing biodiesel from used cooking oil (UCO); however, the importation of UCO is not currently allowed in India, and as a result, we are looking for a local supply source.
 
 Develop and commercially deploy technologies to produce high-margin products. The technology applicable to the Keyes plant for the upgrade of corn oil into valuable, high-margin products can also be deployed at our Kakinada plant in India. By using the existing equipment, process controls, utilities and personnel at the Kakinada plant, we plan to produce high-value products more quickly and at a lower capital and operating cost than Greenfield projects.
 
 Evaluate and pursue technology acquisition opportunities. We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire technologies and processes that result in accretive to earnings opportunities as financial resources and business prospects make the acquisition of these technologies advisable. In addition, we may also seek to acquire companies, or enter into licensing agreements or form joint ventures with companies that offer prospects for the adoption of accretive to earnings business opportunities.

  2017 Highlights
 
  North America
 
 During 2017, we produced four products at the Keyes plant:  denatured fuel ethanol, WDG, DCO, and CDS.  We sold 100% of the ethanol and WDG produced to J.D. Heiskell pursuant to a Purchase Agreement established with J.D. Heiskell.  J.D. Heiskell in turn sells 100% of our ethanol to Kinergy Marketing LLC (“Kinergy”) and 100% of our WDG to A.L. Gilbert Co. (“A.L. Gilbert”), a local feed and grain business. We sell DCO directly to local animal feedlots (primarily poultry) as well as other feed mills for use in various animal feed products. Smaller amounts of CDS were sold to various local third parties as an animal feed supplement.  
 
  The following table sets forth information about our production and sales of ethanol and its by-products in 2017 and 2016:
 
 
 | 2017 | 2016 | % Change
----------------------------+--------+--------+---------
Ethanol | | | 
Gallons Sold (in thousands) | 60,774 | 55,641 | 9.2% 
Average Sales Price/Gallon | $1.75 | $1.78 | -1.7% 
WDG | | | 
Tons Sold (in thousands) | 407 | 372 | 9.4% 
Average Sales Price/Ton | $64.93 | $70.61 | -8.0% 


 
 Ethanol pricing for sales to J.D. Heiskell is determined pursuant to a marketing agreement between Kinergy and us, and is generally based on daily and monthly pricing for ethanol delivered to the San Francisco Bay Area as published by the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), as well as quarterly contracts negotiated by Kinergy with numerous fuel blenders.  The price for WDG is determined monthly pursuant to a marketing agreement between A.L. Gilbert and us, and is generally determined in reference to the local price of dry distillers grains (DDG), corn, and other protein feedstuffs.
 
  India
 
  In 2017, we produced two products at the Kakinada plant: biodiesel and refined glycerin. Crude glycerin produced as a by-product of the production of biodiesel was further processed into refined glycerin.
 
  The following table sets forth information about our production and sales of biodiesel and refined glycerin in 2017 and 2016:
 
 
 | 2017 | 2016 | % Change
------------------------+--------+--------+---------
Biodiesel | | | 
Tons sold (1) | 12,161 | 16,080 | -24% 
Average Sales Price/Ton | $851 | $739 | 15% 
Refined Glycerin | | | 
Tons sold | 3,793 | 4,413 | -14% 
Average Sales Price/Ton | $810 | $582 | 39% 


 
   (1)
 1 metric ton is equal to 1,000 kilograms (approximately 2,204 pounds).

 
  In 2017, the introduction of GST increased the tax rate to 18% from 11% and affected our revenues and gross margins. On January 25, 2018, GST was reduced from 18% to 12% which is expected to drive revenues and margins higher in 2018.
 
  Competition
 
  North America
 
 According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, there were approximately 200 operating commercial ethanol production facilities in the U.S. with a combined nameplate production of approximately 15.5 billion gallons per year at the beginning of 2017. The production of ethanol is a commodity-based business where producers compete on the basis of price. We sell ethanol into the Northern California market; however, since insufficient production capacity exists in California to supply the state’s total fuel ethanol consumption (in excess of 1.5 billion gallons annually), we compete with ethanol transported into California from Midwestern producers. Similarly, our co-products, principally WDG and DCO, are sold into local California markets and they compete with DDG and corn oil imported into the California markets as well as alternative feed products.

  India
 
  With respect to biodiesel sold as fuel, we compete primarily with the producers of petroleum diesel, consisting of the three state-controlled oil companies: Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, and two private oil companies: Reliance Petroleum and Essar Oil, all of whom have significantly larger market shares than we do and control a significant share of the distribution network. These competitors may also purchase our product for blending and further sales to their customers. We compete primarily on the basis of price.
 
  With respect to biodiesel sold for manufacturing purposes, we compete with specialty chemical manufacturers selling products into the textile industries primarily on the basis of price. With respect to crude and refined glycerin, we compete with other glycerin producers and refiners selling products into the personal care, paints and adhesive markets primarily on the basis of price and product quality.
 
  Customers
 
  North America
 
  All of our ethanol and WDG are sold to J.D. Heiskell pursuant to a purchase agreement. J.D. Heiskell in turn sells all of our ethanol to Kinergy and all of our WDG to A.L. Gilbert. Kinergy markets and sells our ethanol to petroleum refiners and blenders in Northern California. A.L. Gilbert markets and sells our WDG to approximately 100 dairy and feeding operators in Northern California.
 India
 
  During 2017, we derived 77% and 23% of our sales from biodiesel and refined glycerin respectively. Two of our biodiesel customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated India segment revenues at 47% and 13%. None of our refined glycerin customers have accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated India segment revenues in 2017. During 2016, we derived 82% and 18% of our sales from biodiesel and refined glycerin respectively. Two of our biodiesel customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated India segment revenues at 51% and 12%. None of our refined glycerin customers accounted for more than 10% of our sales on the consolidated India segment revenues in 2016.
 Pricing
 
  North America
 
 We sell 100% of the ethanol and WDG we produce to J.D. Heiskell. Ethanol pricing is determined pursuant to a marketing agreement between Kinergy and us and is generally based on daily and monthly pricing for ethanol delivered to the San Francisco Bay area in California, as published by OPIS, as well as the terms of quarterly contracts negotiated by Kinergy with local fuel blenders and available premiums for fuel with low carbon intensity as provided by California’s LCFS. The price for WDG is determined monthly pursuant to a marketing agreement between A.L. Gilbert and us and is generally determined in reference to the price of DDG and other protein feedstuffs, based on local pricing in California’s Central Valley.
 India
 
  In India, the price of biodiesel is based on the price of petroleum diesel, which floats with changes in the price determined by the international markets. Biodiesel sold into Europe is based on the spot market price. We sell our biodiesel primarily to resellers, distributors and refiners on an as-needed basis. We have no long-term sales contracts. Our biodiesel pricing is related to the price of petroleum diesel, and the increase in the price of petroleum diesel is expected to favorably impact the profitability of our India operations.

  Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
  North America
 
 We entered into a Corn Procurement and Working Capital Agreement with J.D. Heiskell in March 2011, which we amended in May 2013 (Heiskell Agreement). Under the Heiskell Agreement, we agreed to procure number two yellow dent corn from J.D. Heiskell. We have the ability to obtain corn from other sources subject to certain conditions; however, in 2017, all of our corn supply was purchased from J.D. Heiskell. Title to the corn and risk of loss pass to us when the corn is deposited into our weigh scale. The agreement is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms. The current term is set to expire on December 31, 2018.
 India
 
  In 2017, a significant amount of our biodiesel was derived from processing RBD palm stearin, which was imported from Indonesia, and the remaining portion from refining feedstocks based on animal fats. During 2017 and 2016, we imported crude glycerin for further processing into refined glycerin. In addition to feedstock, the Kakinada plant requires quantities of methanol and chemical catalysts for use in the biodiesel production process. These chemicals are also readily available and sourced from a number of suppliers surrounding the Kakinada plant. We are not dependent on sole source or limited source suppliers for any of our raw materials or chemicals.
 Sales and Marketing
 
  North America
 
  As part of our obligations under the Heiskell Agreement, we entered into a purchase agreement with J.D. Heiskell, pursuant to which we granted J.D. Heiskell exclusive rights to purchase 100% of the ethanol and WDG we produce at prices based upon the price established by the marketing agreements with Kinergy and A.L. Gilbert. In turn, J.D. Heiskell agreed to resell all the ethanol to Kinergy (or any other purchaser we designate) and all of the WDG to A.L. Gilbert.
 
  In March 2011, we entered into a WDG Purchase and Sale Agreement with A.L. Gilbert, pursuant to which A.L. Gilbert agreed to market, on an exclusive basis, all of the WDG we produce. The agreement is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms. The current term is set to expire on December 31, 2018.
 
 In October 2010, we entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with Kinergy to market and sell our ethanol. The agreement is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms. The current term is set to expire on August 31, 2018.
 
 We sell our DCO and CDS directly to local third-party animal feedlots.
 
  India
 
  We sell our biodiesel and refined glycerin (i) to end-users utilizing our own sales force and independent sales agents and (ii) to brokers who resell the product to end-users. We pay a sales commission on sales arranged by independent sales agents.
 Commodity Risk Management Practices
 
  North America
 
  The cost of corn and the price of ethanol are volatile and the correlation of the pricing of these commodities form the basis for the profit margin at our Keyes plant. We are, therefore, exposed to commodity price risk. Our risk management strategy is to operate in the physical market by purchasing corn and selling ethanol on a daily basis at the then prevailing market price. We monitor these prices daily to test for an overall positive variable contribution margin. We periodically explore and utilize methods of mitigating the volatility of our commodity prices. During 2017, we offered three-month WDG contracts to our customers, which we offset with the purchase of corn basis, allowing us to fix a portion of the margin at the Keyes plant. Similarly, with the EPA certification received in August 2013, we intend to opportunistically purchase the combination of milo and biogas to generate advanced biofuel RIN credits, when market conditions present favorable margins.

  India
 
  The cost of NRPO, RBD palm stearin and the price of biodiesel are volatile and are generally uncorrelated. We therefore are exposed to ongoing and substantial commodity price risk. Our risk management strategy is to produce biodiesel in India only when we believe we can generate positive gross margins and to idle the Kakinada plant during periods of low or negative gross margins. Additionally, we are pursuing relationships with large oil companies and trading partners pursuant to which we would process feedstocks and produce biofuels for sales into international markets on a fixed margin basis. Beginning in 2014, we began using animal oil and fats as a means of further diversifying our feedstock supply and improving margins.
 
  In addition, to minimize our commodity risk, we modified the processes within our facility to utilize lower cost NRPO and imported RBD palm stearin (waste from refined palm oil), which enables us to reduce our feedstock costs. The price of our biodiesel is generally indexed to the price of petroleum diesel, which floats with changes in the price determined by the international markets.
 
  We have in the past, and we may in the future, use forward purchase contracts and other hedging strategies; however, the extent to which we engage in these risk management strategies may vary substantially from time to time depending on market conditions and other factors.
 
  Research and Development
 
  Our R&D efforts consist of working to develop and commercialize our existing microbial technology, to evaluate third party technologies, and to expand the production of ethanol and other renewable bio-chemicals in the United States. The primary objective of this development activity is to optimize the production of ethanol using either our proprietary, patent-pending enzyme technology for large-scale commercial production or the evaluation of third party technologies which have promise for large-scale commercial adoption at one of our operating facilities. Our innovations are protected by several issued or pending patents. We are in the process of filing additional patents that will further strengthen our portfolio.
 
  We also engaged in building an Integrated Demonstration Testing Unit for our cellulosic ethanol project in 2017, which was successfully built and tested for producing renewable cellulosic ethanol by combining the Lanza Tech Technology and the InEnTec Technology with our own technology. The expense of building this unit was charged to R&D expense in 2017.
 
  R&D expense was $2.4 million and $0.4 million respectively, in the years ended 2017 and 2016.
 
  Patents and Trademarks
 
 We filed a number of trademark applications within the U.S.  We do not consider the success of our business, as a whole, to be dependent on these trademarks.  In addition, we hold ten awarded patents in the United States.  Our patents cover the Z-microbeTM and production of cellulosic ethanol and a technology to convert carbon chain chemical structures.  We intend to develop, maintain and secure further intellectual property rights, and pursue new patents to expand upon our current patent base.
  
 We have acquired exclusive rights to patented technology in support of the development and commercialization of our products, and we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary technology in developing potential products.  We continue to place significant emphasis on securing global intellectual property rights and we are pursuing new patents to expand upon our strong foundation for commercializing products in development.
 
  We have received, and in the future, we may receive additional, claims of infringement of other parties’ proprietary rights. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, below. Infringement or other claims could be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future, and it is possible that future assertions or prosecutions could harm our business. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause delays in the development of our products, or require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may require us to license back our technology or may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

  Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 
  North America
 
 In November 2017, the EPA finalized the volume requirements and associated percentage standards that apply under the RFS program in calendar year 2018 for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel.
 
 The final volumes requirements are set forth below and represent continued growth over historic levels, although the requirement for cellulosic biofuel was slightly lowered to match expected production in 2018. The final percentage standards meet or exceed the volume targets specified by Congress for total renewable fuel, biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel.
 
 
Renewable Fuel Volume Requirements for 2014-2018
------------------------------------------------
Year | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 
Cellulosic biofuel (million gallons) | 33 | 123 | 230 | 311 | 288 
Biomass-based diesel (billion gallons) | 1.63 | 1.73 | 1.9 | 2.0 | 2.1 
Advanced biofuel (billion gallons) | 2.67 | 2.88 | 3.61 | 4.28 | 4.29 
Renewable fuel (billion gallons) | 16.28 | 16.93 | 18.11 | 19.28 | 19.29

  We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees. These laws, regulations and permits may, from time to time, require us to incur significant capital costs. These include, but are not limited to, testing and monitoring plant emissions, and where necessary, obtaining and maintaining mitigation processes to comply with regulations. They may also require us to make operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A significant violation of these laws, regulations, permits or license conditions could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental laws and regulations change over time, and any such changes, more vigorous enforcement policies or the discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial additional environmental expenditures.
 
  We are also subject to potential liability for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the disposal of hazardous wastes. If significant contamination is identified at our properties in the future, costs to investigate and remediate this contamination as well as costs to investigate or remediate associated damage could be significant. If any of these sites are subject to investigation and/or remediation requirements, we may be responsible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) or other environmental laws for all or part of the costs of such investigation and/or remediation, and for damage to natural resources. We may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage or personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials at or from such properties. While costs to address contamination or related third-party claims could be significant, based upon currently available information, we are not aware of any material contamination or any such third-party claims. Based on our current assessment of the environmental and regulatory risks, we have not accrued any amounts for environmental matters as of December 31, 2017. The ultimate costs of any liabilities that may be identified or the discovery of additional contaminants could materially adversely impact our results of operation or financial condition.

  In addition, the production and transportation of our products may result in spills or releases of hazardous substances, which could result in claims from governmental authorities or third parties relating to actual or alleged personal injury, property damage, or damage to natural resources. We maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses caused by our operations. Our general and umbrella liability policy coverage includes, but is not limited to, physical damage to assets, employer’s liability, comprehensive general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation. We do not carry environmental insurance. We believe that our insurance is adequate for our industry, but losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of events which result in significant personal injury or damage to our property, natural resources or third parties that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
 
  Our air emissions are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, and similar state laws, which generally require us to obtain and maintain air emission permits for our ongoing operations as well as for any expansion of existing facilities or any new facilities. Obtaining and maintaining those permits requires us to incur costs, and any future more stringent standards may result in increased costs and may limit or interfere with our operating flexibility. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Because other ethanol manufacturers in the U.S. are and will continue to be subject to similar laws and restrictions, we do not currently believe that our costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations will adversely affect our competitive position with other U.S. ethanol producers. However, because ethanol is produced and traded internationally, these costs could adversely affect us in our efforts to compete with foreign producers who are not subject to such stringent requirements.
 
  New laws or regulations relating to the production, disposal or emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may require us to incur significant additional costs with respect to ethanol plants that we build or acquire. For example, in 2007, Illinois and four other Midwestern states entered into the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, which directs participating states to develop a multi-sector cap-and-trade mechanism to help achieve reductions in greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. We currently conduct our North American commercial activities exclusively in California; however, it is possible that other states in which we plan to conduct business could join this accord or require other carbon dioxide emissions reductions. Climate change legislation is being considered in Washington, D.C. this year which may significantly impact the biofuels industry’s emissions regulations, as will the Renewable Fuel Standard, California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and other potentially significant changes in existing transportation fuels regulations.
 
  India
 
  We are subject to national, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permits, including with respect to the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees. These laws may require us to make operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws, regulations or permits can result in substantial fines, natural resource damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental laws and regulations (and interpretations thereof) change over time, and any such changes, more vigorous enforcement policies or the discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial additional environmental expenditures.
 Employees
 
  At December 31, 2017, we had a total of 140 employees, comprised of 14 full-time employees and one part-time equivalent employee in our corporate offices, 44 full-time equivalent employees at the Keyes plant, and 81 full-time equivalent employees in India.
 
 We believe that our employees are highly skilled, and our success will depend in part upon our ability to retain our employees and attract new qualified employees, many of whom are in great demand. We have never had a work stoppage or strike, and no employees are presently represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe relations with our employees are strong.
