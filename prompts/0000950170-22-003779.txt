Overview
 Talis aims to transform diagnostic testing by developing and commercializing innovative products that are designed to enable accurate, reliable, low cost and rapid molecular testing for infectious diseases and other conditions at the point of care. While timely diagnosis of infectious diseases is critically important to enable effective treatment, testing is primarily performed in centralized laboratories, which require samples to be shipped for processing, delaying the return of results by days. Point-of-care testing solves this problem by delivering the timely information necessary for clinical care. We are developing the Talis One system, a sample-to-answer, cloud-enabled molecular diagnostic platform that, once manufacturing scale-up has been validated, could be deployed to a variety of diagnostic settings in the United States and around the world to diagnose infectious disease in the moment of need, at the point of care. The Talis One system comprises a compact instrument, single-use test cartridges and software that is planned to support a central cloud database, which work together and are designed to provide central laboratory levels of accuracy and be operated by an untrained user.

General
 We are developing Talis One assay kits for respiratory infections, and infections related to women’s health and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In the third quarter of 2021, we submitted a request for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our Talis One system in non-laboratory settings. On November 5, 2021, we received an EUA from the FDA for the emergency use of the Talis One system for our COVID-19 test, which we refer to as the Talis One COVID-19 Test System. This assay platform provides for the automated detection of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasal swab samples from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. By submitting for the equivalent of a CLIA-waived authorization, the Talis One COVID-19 Test System may be used in either laboratory or non-laboratory settings. Under the terms of the EUA, we were required to submit data from a post-market study to the FDA by March 5, 2022, although we have been granted an extension to provide this data to the FDA four months after the commercial launch of the Talis One COVID-19 Test System. We currently expect that the future commercial launch will be pursuant to such EUA. At present, we can produce the Talis One instrument and cartridges but not at a scale to support our commercial launch. We are currently validating the performance of our manufacturing equipment and procedures and plan to broadly market our Talis One COVID-19 Test System after the phased launch.
 We are also developing influenza A and influenza B tests to be included as part of a respiratory panel with our COVID-19 assay (Respiratory Panel), as well as exploring adding a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) test. Due to recent changes in FDA EUA guidance, we now plan to pursue clearance for the Respiratory Panel under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). In addition, we plan to initiate a clinical trial to support clearance of a pre-market notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA for our Talis One system with a

test cartridge for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis (CT/NG/TV). If approved, this panel may be marketed as a complete panel or as separate individual analytes depending on market needs, reimbursement or other factors. To support our anticipated commercial launch of our Talis One COVID-19 Test System, we have invested in automated cartridge manufacturing lines, the first of which began to come on-line in the first quarter of 2021 and that we are continuing to validate to ensure that they meet our performance criteria.
In addition to our Respiratory Panel, if the CT/NG/TV assay is cleared or otherwise authorized for marketing, this would be our first commercial offering in the women’s health category. We are planning to develop additional tests for infections related to women’s health, including a panel for STIs and other infections, such as bacterial vaginosis (BV), urinary tract infections (UTI) and herpes simplex virus (HSV).
 The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of point-of-care platforms in both traditional and non-traditional care settings, and we believe the Talis One system is well positioned to meet this growing demand. While a variety of technologies are commercially available, we believe that few, if any, sufficiently meet the needs of healthcare providers in order to drive broad adoption of, and transition to, point-of-care testing for a broad range of infectious diseases. For example, antigen detection technologies, which detect proteins from the pathogen, are rapid and relatively low cost, but they have higher limits of detection. Molecular technologies that detect nucleic acids are generally considered highly accurate for infectious disease testing. However, we believe that some currently available point-of-care molecular technologies have sacrificed accuracy to increase speed. Lower accuracy limits a test’s utility, particularly in the case of testing for dangerous infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, for which an incorrect test result can have severe consequences. We believe that the ideal point-of-care technology for diagnosing infectious diseases would not only be highly accurate and rapid, but would also be easy to use, low cost, cloud-compatible and enable multiplexing to detect multiple pathogens at the same time.
 We are developing the Talis One system to address limitations of existing point-of-care diagnostic testing technologies for infectious diseases. Our system combines robust sample preparation with highly optimized and rapid isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology to enable rapid detection of infectious pathogens in a variety of unpurified patient sample types. We designed the Talis One system to have the following capabilities which we believe will create a competitive advantage over other commercially available point-of-care technologies:
 •Highly accurate—The Talis One system incorporates a shelf-stable, single-use test cartridge designed to fully integrate a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) with sample preparation, including nucleic acid extraction and purification. Sample preparation is well known to be a critical factor to achieve high sensitivity and specificity, along with low limits of detection for target pathogens, in molecular diagnostics. We believe this sample preparation step, which is performed in an automated fashion on our cartridge, has the potential to result in higher sensitivity and specificity than point-of-care technologies that do not perform the sample preparation step. Our Talis One COVID-19 Test System reaches limits of detection as low as 500 viral particles per milliliter. We can achieve similarly high performance on the Talis One system for bacteria with limits of detection of bacterial pathogens as low as one infectious unit per milliliter (IFU/mL) in a variety of unpurified patient sample types, including nasal swab, vaginal swab, saliva and urine.
 •Rapid turnaround time—The Talis One system is designed to provide a positive or negative result in less than 30 minutes, depending upon the test and the concentration of the pathogen in the sample. We believe this turnaround time meets target customers’ needs for a system fast enough to fit into their clinical practice.
 •Ease of use—We designed the Talis One system for operation by untrained users and to function in a CLIA-waived environment such as physicians’ offices, urgent care clinics, elder care and assisted living facilities, cancer treatment and dialysis centers, and potentially in workplaces, schools and other facilities. The Talis One system is designed to be a fully integrated sample-to-answer system requiring two minutes or less of hands-on time by users running the test. The intuitive workflow of the Talis One system is also designed to facilitate the chain of custody of the sample without extensive tracking or handling by the user.
 •Multiplex capability—The cartridge is designed with five separate reaction chambers. There is the ability to add up to an additional nine chambers for a total of 14 reaction chambers, which we believe could potentially enable a full menu of detection modes, from single organism to syndromic panel tests. 


The test cartridge for the Talis One COVID-19 Test System uses three of the five separate assay chambers.
 •Cloud-enabled—Unlike other point-of-care instruments, the Talis One system incorporates a cellular modem within the instrument, which is designed to connect to the cloud to help customers manage clinical data and workflow. The cloud capability is designed to (a) be remotely and securely accessed to obtain key data required to collect, screen, collate, report and monitor disease infection and pandemic spread on a micro and macro level, which could enable the creation of a public health interface and automatic transmission of “reportable infections,” such as COVID-19, to public health authorities in order to facilitate tracking of infectious diseases and (b) enable us to remotely manage instruments in the field, such as providing automated software updates and enable customers to track and manage instruments they have across their networks. For instances where cellular connectivity is unavailable or undesired, the instrument is designed to permit secure connectivity via ethernet. This capability has been built into the Talis One system but will require that we submit additional data to the FDA for review prior to implementation.
 •Scalable for different throughput requirements—The Talis One system is designed to provide a scalable platform for different volume and throughput requirements. The instruments are portable and designed for multi-instrument deployments to satisfy different testing volume requirements and can be stacked three instruments by three instruments without disturbing the cellular connection to the cloud.
 •Low cost to manufacture—We designed the Talis One system to be low-cost and manufactured at scale. We believe this could facilitate (a) scale-up in manufacturing and provide a competitive advantage in cost-sensitive environments and (b) customers acquiring multiple Talis One instruments to meet their volume requirements.
 
We intend to commercialize the Talis One system in the United States through an enterprise account management team and direct sales force. If we increase adoption in the marketplace, we anticipate that this will establish a sales channel through which we can drive future sales of our test menu. Over time, we intend to explore commercialization strategies outside of the United States.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our strategy is to improve medical care through the transformation of diagnostic testing by enabling customers in distributed diagnostic locations to deploy accurate, reliable, low cost and rapid molecular testing for infectious diseases and other conditions. To achieve this, we intend to:
    Pursue commercialization of our COVID-19 Test System in the United States
 •We intend to commercialize the Talis One system through an enterprise sales team and a direct sales force focused initially on placing systems with potential customers that place high value on accuracy, and our broader test menu in development. Target customer segments include (but are not limited to): (1) traditional medical establishments, including physician offices, urgent care chains, hospitals, and public health clinics that that need rapid and high-quality testing to best serve their patients and (2) additional segments, including schools, workplaces, prisons, and elder care facilities.
    Increase our low-cost manufacturing capacity for our Talis One instrument and COVID-19 test cartridges
 •We have ordered components for up to 5,000 instruments from our instrument contract manufacturing partners.
 •We have invested in automated cartridge manufacturing lines that are designed to meet the anticipated volume commercial needs for the Talis One system once validation of performance is complete.
 •As we improve and scale manufacturing and automation, we expect to drive cost of goods reductions for our tests.
      
Complete development of and, if marketing authorizations are obtained, commercialize other tests for other respiratory infections, infections related to women’s health and sexually transmitted infections in the United States
 •We are developing additional tests for respiratory infections, including influenza A and B and RSV. For the combination Respiratory Panel, consisting of COVID-19, Influenza A, Influenza B, and potentially RSV, we intend to pursue marketing authorization through the 510(k) clearance pathway and to commercialize thereafter. The FDA’s marketing authorization requirements for the Respiratory Panel will impact the timing to develop and commercialize this combination panel, if authorized.
 •We are also developing a full menu of tests for infections related to women’s health and sexually transmitted infections. We are focusing initially on our CT/NG/TV test, for which we plan to initiate a clinical study to support a 510(k) pre-market notification after the successful completion of the trial. We are subsequently targeting other STIs, such as a panel for sexually transmitted inflection that would include CT/NG/TV, Mycoplasma genitalium, a panel for BV, a panel for UTI, and single target tests for infectious agents such as Group B streptococcus, or HSV. If we obtain marketing authorization from the FDA, we intend to focus our commercialization efforts both on existing customers who may value our broader test menu, as well as obstetricians and gynecologists, the most common purchasers of these tests. We believe that a rapid, affordable and accurate point-of-care platform would enable these physicians to better diagnose and treat patients, practice value-based care, and create revenue opportunities by testing in-house rather than sending tests out to centralized laboratories.
    Pursue marketing clearance and, if received, commercialize our products and expand our operations in selected geographies globally
 •We intend to pursue clearance to affix a CE Mark to enable commercialization of our Talis One COVID-19 Test System in Europe.
 •We will evaluate opportunities to commercialize other products in markets outside of the United States through a direct sales force or distributors, depending on the geography and demand.
    Continue to invest in capabilities to drive sustainable growth
 •We intend to focus on innovation to improve the technical performance of our Talis One system and develop an expanded test menu.
 •We intend to continue our research and development activities and to leverage proprietary innovations to develop additional systems in the future designed to solve diagnostic challenges for our customers.
 •We intend to strive for operational efficiencies and manufacturing capabilities to further drive economies of scale and lower manufacturing costs. 
 Industry background
 Infectious disease remains among the top health problems facing populations around the world. While infectious disease is an enduring concern for public health, beginning in 2020, the world has been challenged, and continued to be challenged, by the COVID-19 global pandemic.
 While the current pandemic presents a large and acute need for testing for COVID-19, the mortality rate for all infectious disease in the United States ranged between 42 and 63 deaths per 100,000 population, accounting for 5.4% of overall mortality for the period of 1980-2014.
 The drawbacks of centralized laboratory testing
 The need to send samples to a central location for testing introduces delays in treatment or incentivizes prescribing treatment in the absence of a definitive diagnosis. The turnaround time for centralized lab tests is typically one to five days and can often be longer. Therefore, physicians are faced with one of two choices: either wait days for test results before initiating treatment and risk that an infected patient may continue to spread the infection and suffer increasingly negative health effects from delayed treatment or treat empirically while the patient is in front of them. Smaller hospital and clinic laboratories, many in rural settings, may not have the testing volume to justify investing

in high throughput molecular diagnostic instruments, requiring smaller hospitals to send out molecular testing to reference laboratories and wait for the results.
 We believe that immediate access to high-quality diagnostic test results will improve medical treatment of disease and avoid inappropriate prescription of antibiotics, which can amplify the growing problem of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In a 2016 study of 1,103 emergency room patients at St. John Hospital & Medical Center in Detroit, 440 patients who had a suspected chlamydia or gonorrhea infection were treated with antibiotics even though the vast majority, 323 patients (74%), ultimately tested negative for the infection. Similarly, in some cases, test result delays lead to patients who do not return after the initial visit, resulting in the health care provider losing these patients to follow-up and unnecessarily exposing additional individuals to detectable and treatable infections. This is particularly problematic in pediatric care and for urgent care and community care clinics.
 Limitations of current point-of-care diagnostic technologies
 There are a broad range of point-of-care technologies available for use in physician offices for a variety of applications, ranging from glucose strips for diabetes to lateral flow immunoassays for detecting high pathogen load infections, such as Strep A or influenza. Molecular testing is less common in point-of-care settings, despite being highly accurate. We believe that this is due to a lack of available point-of-care molecular technologies that sufficiently balance speed, accuracy and cost to meet customer needs and drive broad adoption.
 We believe that most molecular diagnostic solutions currently being marketed for use at the point-of-care each have one or more of the following limitations:
 •Low performance as measured by sensitivity, specificity and limit of detection can result in misdiagnosis and poor clinical outcomes. Several point-of-care molecular diagnostic platforms provide results in less than 30 minutes but achieve this speed by performing nucleic acid amplification on samples, foregoing sample preparation, which is known to limit the sensitivity, specificity and limit of detection of these nucleic acid tests.
 •Slow turnaround time can extend beyond the time a patient will wait for results and potentially result in loss of patient to follow-up. Other available point-of-care systems may provide reliable, high performance results, but these tests can take 45 to 90 minutes to return a result. While results returned within hours is better than days, we believe that the longer a test takes, the less willing patients will be to wait at the clinical site for results, thereby risking patients failing to return after the initial visit and unnecessarily exposing additional individuals to a detectable infectious agent.
 •Platforms requiring significant user interaction or monitoring will not work well with clinical workflow. Some platforms sold as point-of-care solutions require users to transfer solutions midway through a run or handle the instrument, test cartridge and/or sample multiple times, in order to process one test. The typical physician’s office does not have laboratory personnel who can monitor an instrument, nor personnel trained in sample custody tracking.
 •Platforms that are difficult to manufacture at low cost or at scale can limit adoption. We believe that the cost of purchasing and using diagnostic testing platforms and consumables is a primary concern for customers.
 •Limited test menus fail to meet the needs of clinicians. The adoption of diagnostic technologies is contingent upon the technology having both clinical utility, and economic rationale. Without a broad and relevant testing menu, testing platforms may not sufficiently meet the clinical needs of customers to justify the expense. We believe the ability to develop our planned additional assays will create a competitive barrier to entry for other platforms.
 The Talis One system
 We are developing the Talis One system to address the limitations of existing point-of-care diagnostic testing technologies for infectious diseases. Our system combines robust sample preparation with highly-optimized and rapid isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology to enable rapid detection of infectious pathogens in a variety of unpurified patient sample types. The Talis One system is an integrated system that includes a compact instrument, single-use test cartridges and software, including a central cloud database.
Talis One cartridge
 At the core of our system is the Talis One cartridge, a versatile shelf-stable and single-use test cartridge designed to fully integrate proprietary highly-optimized nucleic acid isothermal amplification assays with sample preparation. The cartridge is designed to handle a wide range of sample types, including nasal swab, vaginal swab, saliva, urine, whole blood, plasma, serum and sputum, to be compatible with lysis by bead-beating in order to process a wide range of pathogens, including viral, bacterial and hard-to-lyse fungal pathogens. The cartridge design incorporates a patented rotary valve that integrates sample purification and is easily adaptable to alternate fluidic layouts to accommodate alternate testing methods that may require pre-treatment of specimens, pre-amplification and/or multiple purification steps to facilitate expansion of the testing menu. The cartridge also incorporates a reagent plug technology licensed from a contract manufacturing partner, which is designed to enable implementation of new tests on the same cartridge backbone simply by inserting plugs with different target assay reagents. The reagent plugs in our cartridges are optically clear, permitting the instrument to visualize and detect fluorescent signals from the amplification assay. Patented assay wells employ a fluidic design and include a mechanism to heat-seal the cartridge for amplicon containment designed to prevent contamination of the work surfaces.
 The cartridge, with modifications, is designed to support up to 14-well multiplexing, which we believe will enable development of expanded panels and syndromic applications. The specific cartridge that we developed for the COVID-19 and CT/NG/TV tests provides 5-fold multiplexing, which we believe is sufficient to meet our anticipated product plans.
 Talis One instrument
 The Talis One instrument is designed to enable sample-to-answer capabilities without user intervention. We designed the instrument to be low cost, portable and easy to use. We believe the modular design, which is divided into major subsystems for performing cartridge handling, sample preparation, amplification and detection, will facilitate automated assembly and low-cost manufacturing. The compact size, approximately 7 x 10 x 14 inches, is designed to enable portability and use in various front-line locations. The instrument incorporates a touchpad interface for easily communicating instructions, information and results to the user. An integrated camera that reads and enables registration of a label on the cartridge, facilitates sample custody by linking an image of the cartridge label with test results. The instruments are designed for multi-instrument deployments to satisfy different testing volume requirements and can be stacked three instruments by three instruments without disturbing the cellular connection to the cloud.
 Talis One software and IT
 The Talis One system incorporates software and information technology (IT) capabilities. The instrument is designed to communicate test results to a central cloud database that can be remotely and securely accessed to obtain key data required to collect, screen, collate, report, and monitor disease infection and pandemic spread on a micro and macro level. The cellular and ethernet connectivity built into each Talis One instrument is also designed to enable Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)-compliant transmission, storage, and review. Such centralized storage could permit (i) creation of a public health interface granting access to select information to governmental entities and/or (ii) automatic transmission of “reportable infections” to public health authorities. The cloud-based data could serve to help institutions better manage clinical practice and also to improve infection control. With substantially increased adoption over time, the data may offer a mapping of infection patterns that public health and research institutions can use to address care on a larger scale. Additionally, for organizations that may desire multiple instrument placements, such as in multiple exam rooms, multiple departments or distributed testing sites, authorized administrators may be able to monitor, in real-time, the status of any instrument in the organization, as well as manage users, passwords, and certain security features. The continuous connectivity of the Talis One instruments is also designed to enable us to provide automated updates including security patches, instrument configurations, and firmware and software updates, the latter of which could be deployed to enable the instrument to recognize and run newly released tests.
 Talis One workflow
 The Talis One system is capable of being integrated into the clinical workflow as follows: (1) label cartridge with patient information, (2) dispense sample into loading port and close lid, (3) insert cartridge into instrument, and (4)

follow on-instrument instructions to initiate testing, results will automatically display after less than 30 minutes. The workflow may vary for alternate sample types.
The Talis One workflow follows a few simple steps from sample preparation to results. The system is designed to return results in less than 30 minutes and requires two minutes or less of hands-on time for the operator. After the sample is collected and the cartridge is introduced into the instrument, the instrument confirms the operability of the cartridge, runs the assay and communicates the test result to the instrument display. We believe the ease of use, compact size and speed could enable near-patient diagnosis in a broad range of settings.
 Talis One assay kits
 We are a development stage company and, to date, we have not generated revenue from the sales of our own product. As described below, we are developing Talis One assay kits for respiratory infections, infections related to women’s health and STIs. Our first test to be marketed will be the Talis One COVID-19 Test System, which focuses on detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. We are also developing additional tests for the detection of other respiratory infections, such as the Respiratory Panel. We also intend to submit for a 510(k) clearance to commercialize our Talis One system with a test for CT/NG/TV. For other tests that are not eligible for an EUA, we intend to complete the requirements for and submit a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA (if available to us; otherwise we would plan to submit another form of marketing authorization under the FDA’s standard medical device authorities). We chose our assay development roadmap to address the most common clinically relevant tests that require high sensitivity and specificity and for which timely results provide significant clinical benefit. In addition to the CT/NG/TV test, our women’s and sexual health roadmap includes plans to develop and seek marketing authorization for (1) an STI panel including CT, NG, TV, and Mycoplasma genitalium; (2) an assay for HSV; (3) a multitarget panel assay for UTI; (4) a multitarget panel assay for BV; and (5) a single target assay for Group B streptococcus.
 Respiratory infections
 The Talis One COVID-19 Test System
 The Talis One COVID-19 Test System is our first product that we developed for respiratory infections. The test cartridge for COVID-19 diagnosis contains a NAAT designed for optimal sensitivity and specificity to provide highly accurate results. The assay on the Talis One cartridge is an isothermal NAAT targeting two physically separated locations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome to increase sensitivity and inclusivity. The inclusion of two distinct targets reduces the likelihood that natural mutations in the virus would cause a false negative result when using the Talis One COVID-19 Test System. In the third quarter of 2021, we submitted a request for EUA to the FDA for our Talis One system in non-laboratory setting, and on November 5, 2021, we received an EUA from the FDA for the emergency use of the Talis One COVID-19 Test System. We are currently pursuing authorization to affix a CE Mark from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the Talis One COVID-19 Test System and plan to complete this self-certification process under the European In-Vitro Diagnostic Directive by May 2022.
 Respiratory panels
 If we successfully commercialize the Talis One COVID-19 Test System, we plan to incorporate the Influenza A, Influenza B, and potentially the RSV tests with the COVID-19 test in an upper respiratory panel on a single cartridge. We plan to seek marketing authorizations for such multi-panel tests through a 510(k) clearance process.
 Infections related to women’s health and sexually transmitted infections
 We are also developing our Talis One system to be used for infections related to women’s health and STIs. We intend to complete clinical development of our Talis One system for CT/NG/TV and submit a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA after the successful completion of our clinical trials. We further intend to explore authorization to affix a CE Mark from the EMA approximately six months after 510(k) clearance, if obtained. If cleared or otherwise authorized for marketing, this would be our first commercial offering in our women’s health menu. We are planning to develop additional tests for infections related to women’s health, including a panel for STIs and other infections, such as BV, UTI and HSV.
 The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends annual CT/NG screening of all sexually active women age 25 and younger and for women over age 25 with risk factors. In addition to promoting our test

menu to our existing customers, we will engage in a focused commercialization effort directed towards obstetricians and gynecologists, where we estimate that a substantial majority of CT/NG testing occurs. Traditionally, testing is carried out by centralized laboratories, and we believe that there is a significant opportunity to move these tests to the point-of-care at the office of the obstetrician and gynecologist or in urgent care clinics or primary care facilities. We believe testing at the point-of-care could (a) improve decision making and enable the provider to use this information to treat the patient in the same visit and (b) improve the patient experience and empower providers and patients to adhere to screening guidelines and improve outcomes. We also believe that care providers may be able to create profit opportunities by bringing testing in-house to the point-of-care. We believe the tests that we are developing for our Talis One system have established reimbursement codes, enabling healthcare providers to submit for reimbursement.
 Future applications
 We are developing new algorithms and a bioinformatics pipeline to design rapid isothermal assays that are based on isothermal amplification chemistries. On the Talis One system, we have observed limits of detection of bacterial pathogens as low as one IFU/mL in a variety of unpurified patient sample types, including nasal swab, vaginal swab, saliva and urine. We have also demonstrated, in a research setting, rapid detection of similarly low concentrations for a variety of bacterial, fungal, parasitic and viral pathogens.
 Commercialization
As part of our menu expansion outside of COVID-19 testing, we are developing relevant in vitro diagnostic tests for a variety of respiratory infections, and infections related to women’s health and STIs. We estimate that the total potential annualized addressable global market opportunity for molecular testing of infectious diseases is over $5.4 billion for 2022 and is expected to grow to over $7.1 billion by 2026.
 We intend to commercialize the Talis One system through an enterprise sales team and a direct sales force focused initially on placing systems with potential customers that place high value on accuracy and our broader test menu in development. Target customer segments include (but are not limited to): (1) traditional medical establishments, including physician offices, urgent care chains, hospitals, and public health clinics and (2) additional segments, including schools, workplaces, prisons, and elder care facilities.
 We intend to offer our Talis One system to customers via direct purchase of the instrument or through a reagent rental program. Under these options we expect to generate revenue in the form of instrument sales or rentals, test cartridge sales, instrument warranty payments, and test collection device revenue.
 We designed our system for the institutional healthcare provider category, particularly those that serve populations who are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. We believe that this market category could be a significant driver of our growth both near and longer-term due to the many types and significant number of potential institutional healthcare providers. Institutional healthcare providers typically represent sizeable patient populations, allowing a relatively large number of patients to be targeted with a limited number of account managers. Although institutional healthcare providers may require a sales cycle lasting several weeks or months, fixed-price arrangements from certain of these customers may provide us with a steady and predictable revenue stream.
 While institutional healthcare providers are an important selling focus initially, we believe establishment of a direct sales force will enhance our growth, increase the number of institutional referrals, and expand the footprint of our brand within the U.S. market.
 In 2021, we expanded the size of our sales force based on the anticipated timing for the commercial launch of the Talis One COVID-19 Test System and other product opportunities that we may pursue in the future. In late December 2021, we entered into an agreement to act as an authorized distributor for third party COVID-19 antigen tests (Antigen Tests). In January 2022, we began purchasing and distributing the Antigen Tests to customers, including sub-distributors, hospitals, physician's offices, urgent care clinics, and public health clinics. This opportunity has allowed us to generate revenue while leveraging our sales force, commercial infrastructure, and operations team. We are not subject to any minimum purchasing requirements or long-term commitments. We will continue to pursue other such product opportunities that can generate revenue and provide relevant experience to our different business units, while maintaining focus on delivering on our core business product, the Talis One system.

In March 2022, we optimized the size of our sales force based on our current anticipated timing for the commercial launch of the Talis One COVID-19 Test System.
 Competition
 The in vitro diagnostics industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary intellectual property. Due to the significant interest and growth in diagnostics, we expect ongoing intense competition primarily from centralized laboratories and diagnostic companies offering both point-of-care and at-home solutions. We believe key competitive factors include the accuracy, utility, turnaround time and economics of our products, and commercial execution. We also believe our ability to succeed in the future depends on the timing of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals, as well as the timing of our ability to deliver instruments and consumables into the marketplace in significant volumes. We have encountered manufacturing challenges that have contributed to significant delays in our ability to produce the Talis One system at scale which has then delayed the commercialization of the Talis One system.
Our competitors include those offering molecular, antibody and antigen tests. Competitors in the reference lab category include Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (commonly referred to as LabCorp) and Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, along with many hospital laboratories. Our competitors in the point-of-care and/or at-home category, for molecular and/or antigen tests that have received an EUA for their COVID-19 tests, include Abbott Laboratories, Binx Health, Inc., BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, Cepheid (a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation), Cue Health Inc., Lucira Health, Inc., Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Visby Medical, Inc., ON/GO, Quidel, and OraSure.
Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, regulatory clearance approval and compliance, and sales and distribution than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies developing tests may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies or customer networks. If our competitors (a) develop and commercialize diagnostic products or services that are more accurate, more convenient to use or more cost-effective than our products or services and/or (b) obtain FDA or other regulatory clearance or approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain clearance or approval or other marketing authorizations for ours, our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated, especially if our competitors establish a strong market position before we are able to enter a particular market.
Government Contract
 National Institutes of Health - Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx)
In July 2020, we were awarded a $25.4 million contract from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for Phase 2 of its RADx initiative (NIH Contract), of which $8.9 million had been received as of December 31, 2021, for the validation, approval, and scale-up of capacity for manufacturing of the Talis One instrument and test cartridges. Due to delays in meeting certain milestones, we received several extensions to the NIH Contract that concomitantly extended the time to perform the remaining milestones and reduced the potential milestone payments. The NIH Contract expired on January 30, 2022, and we did not achieve the final two milestones.
Operations
 Manufacturing process
 Our products are manufactured by several third parties, including a single contract manufacturer that provisions the parts and assembles our instrument. The instrument assembly is largely manual with some automation in testing. We have various suppliers that provide molded parts and reagents that are assembled by two contract manufacturers for the cartridge. We have made significant investments to scale up cartridge manufacturing including high cavity count molding capability and automation of significant portions of the cartridge assembly process. Due to the complexity of the manufacturing process, we have experienced significant delays in bringing the automated manufacturing lines online. We are focused on developing more internal expertise in manufacturing our cartridges and are developing internal pilot manufacturing lines. Our operations consist of demand forecast planning, raw material procurement, and quality oversight. The operations team is responsible for ensuring adherence to our Quality Management System to meet or exceed applicable standards to support manufacturing, testing and distribution of our products.


Supply chain management
 We utilize multiple vendors for our supply chain. Currently, many of the materials, enzymes and reagents used in our systems and cartridges are from single source suppliers. However, we are evaluating redundancy vendors for reagents and other materials, where possible. To further mitigate risk, we are implementing multi-month, multi-lot safety stock strategy to promote an uninterrupted supply of critical or scarce reagents and other materials. Initially, we plan to source many of the test cartridge materials and provide them to our contract manufacturers. Over time, we plan to transfer acquisition of these materials to our contract manufacturing partners. We have engaged a third-party logistics company to manage the movement of materials between suppliers and for finished goods warehousing, as well as to manage the receipt and shipment to customers of the Antigen Tests.
 Supply Agreement with thinXXS Microtechnology AG (thinXXS)
 In May 2020, we entered into a supply agreement with thinXXS (thinXXS Agreement), a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDEX Corporation (NYSE:IEX), for the purchase of certain materials, including single-use cartridges for use with the Talis One system and components and subassemblies of such single-use cartridges. Pursuant to the thinXXS Agreement, we are required to submit an annual forecast of expected purchase volumes with portions of such annual forecast constituting a binding commitment based on certain percentages set forth in the thinXXS Agreement. We are also required to submit non-binding rolling forecasts to thinXXS. The prices we pay were initially fixed upon execution of the thinXXS Agreement and may not be increased until a specified date. Following such specified date, the purchase prices will be negotiated by the parties. Additionally, subject to certain criteria, thinXXS has the right to be our exclusive supplier of the cartridges, up to a specified annual volume.
The initial term of the thinXXS Agreement is 10 years, after which the thinXXS Agreement will remain in effect unless we provide two years’ prior written notice of non-renewal. The thinXXS Agreement can also be terminated (i) after May 2027, by us for convenience, upon two years’ prior written notice, (ii) subject to certain conditions, by either party upon 90 days’ prior written notice of an uncured material breach of the thinXXS Agreement, and (iii) by either party upon bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. The parties agreed to amend the thinXXS Agreement and a 2021 purchase order issued under the thinXXS Agreement, in late December 2021, which, among other things, reduced our outstanding payment obligations.
 Intellectual property
 Our intellectual property strategy is focused on protecting our core technologies, including target-specific amplification reagents, integrated cartridges and components thereof, and related instrumentation and software applications through patents and other intellectual property rights. In addition, we protect our ongoing research and development into the detection of infectious diseases through patents and other intellectual property rights in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, such as Japan, China, the United Kingdom and the European Union (through shared registration or examination agencies such as the European Patent Office or European Intellectual Property Office).
Patents
 As of February 1, 2022, we solely own 14 issued U.S. patents, 20 pending U.S. patent applications, 14 issued foreign patents, 84 pending foreign patent applications, and two pending PCT international patent applications. We co-own three issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications, one issued foreign patent, and 14 pending foreign patent applications with Caltech. We exclusively in-license 10 issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications, 20 issued foreign patents and two pending foreign patent applications from the University of Chicago and/or Caltech. We believe that the technology we have in-licensed from the University of Chicago and Caltech, respectively, has no impact on our competitive position in our industry. Our patent portfolio generally includes patents and patent applications relating to microfluidic systems, our rapid isothermal amplification method, integrated cartridges and instrument for the Talis One system, as well as components thereof and methods of operating the same. In addition to patents and applications related generally to the Talis One system, our portfolio includes patents and applications drawn to assay reagents for specific targets, including SARS-CoV-2 (the causative pathogen for COVID-19), CT, and NG. Issued U.S. patents in our portfolio of company-owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications (if issued) are expected to expire between 2030 and 2040.
Trademarks
 Our trademark portfolio is designed to protect the brands of our current and future products and includes U.S. trademark applications for registration for our company name, Talis, and the product name Talis One.
Trade secrets
 We also rely on trade secrets, including know-how, unpatented technology and other proprietary information, to strengthen our competitive position. We have determined that certain technologies, such as aspects of our amplification chemistry, some bioinformatics, data processing and analysis techniques, and manufacturing processes are better kept as trade secrets, rather than pursuing patent protection. To prevent disclosure of trade secrets to others, it is our policy to enter into nondisclosure, invention assignment and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to trade secrets, such as our employees, collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
 In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, we may also in-license third party intellectual property for use in our products through both exclusive and non-exclusive licensing agreements. Although we have been able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, there is no guarantee that we may obtain such licenses in the future on reasonable terms or at all.
 Government regulation and product approval
 Our products under development and our operations are subject to significant government regulation.
 Regulation in the United States
 In the United States, our products are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. Numerous laws and regulations govern the processes by which medical devices are brought to market and marketed, including the FDCA and the FDA’s implementing regulations, among others. The FDA regulates the preclinical and clinical testing, approval, manufacture, labeling, distribution, and promotion of medical devices. The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or pre-market authorization (PMA) of new product versions, revocation of 510(k) clearance or PMAs previously granted, and criminal prosecution and penalties.
 The FDA classifies all medical devices into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I and Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices, including performance standards, post-market surveillance, clinical investigations, patient registries and additional conditions set forth in FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) pre-market notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) pre-market notification is generally known as a 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA application. At this time, we have no Class III devices in the pipeline nor plans to add Class III's.
 In addition, EUAs and other forms of approval or clearance may be limited for use with tests by authorized laboratories certified under CLIA to perform moderate and high-complexity tests. In order for a test to be used at the point-of-care, the FDA must grant the test waived status under CLIA, which would permit any laboratory with a Certificate of Waiver to perform the test.
 The U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may declare public health emergencies that have a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens. On February 4, 2020, the novel coronavirus was declared a public health emergency, and it was declared that circumstances existed justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. These EUAs will terminate upon declaration that the public health emergency

circumstances have ceased, or the product provided pursuant to EUA has otherwise achieved commercial authorization for the emergency indication for use, such as through 510(k) clearance, de novo process, or PMA approval.
 In order to be the subject of an EUA, the FDA Commissioner (under authority delegated by the Secretary of the HHS) must conclude that, based on the totality of scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing a disease attributable to the agents described above, that its known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks, and that there is no adequate, approved and available alternative. The FDA may revise or revoke an EUA to protect the public health.
 510(k) clearance process
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared 510(k) device, a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a 510(k) or PMA applications, or is a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I. In rare cases, Class III devices may be cleared through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA but may take significantly longer. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is not "substantially equivalent" to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Once a de novo application is reviewed and approved, it results in the device having a Class II status and future devices from the company or a competitor may use the company’s de novo-classified device as a 510(k) predicate.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA is obtained. Under these circumstances, the FDA may also subject a manufacturer to significant regulatory fines or other penalties.
 Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intends to take to modernize the pre-market notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. The FDA also announced that it intends to finalize guidance to establish a pre-market review pathway for “manufacturers of certain well-understood device types” as an alternative to the 510(k) clearance pathway and that such pre-market review pathway would allow manufacturers to rely on objective safety and performance criteria recognized by the FDA to demonstrate substantial equivalence, obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process.
 In May 2019, the FDA solicited public feedback on its plans to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates, including whether the FDA should publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to

implement such proposals through legislation. More recently, in September 2019, the FDA finalized the aforementioned guidance to describe an optional “safety and performance based” pre-market review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway, by demonstrating that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process.
Pervasive and continuing FDA regulation
 After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous FDA regulatory requirements apply, including, but not limited to the following:
 •the Quality System Regulation (QSR), which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process;
 •establishment registration, which requires establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices, intended for commercial distribution in the United States, to register with the FDA;
 •medical device listing, which requires manufacturers to list the devices they have in commercial distribution with the FDA;
 •clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
 •medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
 •correction, removal and advisory notification reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
 •complying with the new federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database;
 •the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations;
 •labeling regulations, which prohibit “misbranded” devices from entering the market, as well as prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and
 •post-market surveillance including the clinical performance of the product after introduction into the market and Medical Device Reporting, which requires manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
 The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include one or more of the following sanctions:
 •warning letters;
 •customer notifications for repair, replacement or refunds;
 •fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
 •mandatory recall or seizure of our products;
 •administrative detention or banning of our products;


•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
 •refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or PMA of new product versions;
 •revocation of 510(k) clearance or PMAs previously granted; and
 •criminal prosecution and penalties.
 International Regulation
 Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign government regulations and international standards compliance, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ significantly.
 Other healthcare laws
 Our current and future business activities are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician sunshine transparency, and healthy information privacy and security laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the AKS has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, such as the civil False Claims Act (FCA), prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment or approval by the federal government, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Additionally, the FCA authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government intervenes and is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter, or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of life sciences companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil FCA. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is
 expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.


The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the AKS, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Moreover, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act includes in its reporting requirements a broad range of transfers of value including, but not limited to, consulting fees, speaker honoraria, charitable contributions, research payments and grants. Failure to report could subject companies to significant financial penalties. Tracking and reporting the required payments and transfers of value may result in considerable expense and additional resources. Several states currently have similar laws and more states may enact similar legislation, some of which may be broader in scope. For example, certain states require the implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, implementation of gift bans and spending limits, and/or reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals.
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our future operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, additional reporting and oversight requirements, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
 Coverage and reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend in large part on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
Hospitals, clinical laboratories and other healthcare provider customers that may purchase our product candidates, if approved, generally bill various third-party payors to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with diagnostic tests, including the cost of the purchase of our product candidates. If our product candidates are cleared or approved by the FDA as point-of-care tests and deemed CLIA-waived following market authorization, we expect that the majority of our diagnostic tests will be performed in physician offices and other point-of-care settings and billed using existing Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Our healthcare provider customers may not purchase our tests unless third-party payors cover and provide adequate reimbursement for a substantial portion of the price of the tests. If we are not able to obtain coverage and an acceptable level of reimbursement for our tests from third-party payors, there would typically be a greater co-insurance or co-payment requirement from the patient for whom the test is ordered or the patient may be forced to pay the entire cost of the test out-of-pocket, which could dissuade practitioners from ordering our tests and, if ordered, could result in a delay in or decreased likelihood of

collecting payment, whether from patients or from third-party payors. Our customers’ access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products and/or product candidates by government and private insurance plans is central to the acceptance of our products. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of payment, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels.
 The potential end-users of our Talis One system and diagnostic tests include large elder care chains where vulnerable residents have unmet needs for millions of high sensitivity assays per year; urgent care chains that serve on the front lines of COVID-19 diagnosis, needing millions of rapid tests to triage symptomatic patients; and traditional medical establishments including hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, cancer treatment and dialysis centers, independent practice associations, accountable care organizations, and public health clinics that need rapid and high-quality testing to best serve their patients.
 Hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers who purchase diagnostic products in the United States generally rely on third-party payors, such as private health insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the product. Therefore, our market success is highly dependent upon government and commercial third-party payors providing coverage and adequate reimbursement for our test. While we believe our COVID-19 test will qualify for coverage that is currently available for other COVID-19 tests on the market, coverage criteria and reimbursement rates for diagnostic tests are subject to adjustment by payors, and current reimbursement rates could be reduced, or coverage criteria restricted in the future, which could adversely affect the market for our tests.
 There has been federal and state legislation and other reform initiatives regarding the coverage and reimbursement for COVID-19 diagnostic testing in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) generally requires group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance to cover FDA approved COVID-19 tests and associated diagnostic costs with no cost-sharing, as long as the test is deemed medically appropriate and furnished on or after March 18, 2020 and during the applicable public health emergency period. The FFCRA also permits states to cover testing for the uninsured through Medicaid with federal financing. Additionally, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act expanded the FFCRA to include a broader range of diagnostic tests and services as well as requiring plans and issuers to cover out-of-network COVID-19 test claims at up to the cash price that the provider has posted on a public website.
 CMS announced plans in March 2020 to cover the cost of COVID-19 diagnostic testing under the Medicare program and identified the amount at which it would reimburse for such tests, which has been adjusted numerous times. For example, Medicare adjusted its payment methodology effective January 1, 2021, such that it will pay $100 per test only to those laboratories that complete high throughput COVID-19 diagnostic tests within two calendar days of the specimen being collected and will only pay $75 per test to laboratories that take longer than two days to complete such test. This change is indicative of the evolving nature of the coverage and reimbursement of COVID-19 tests. In addition, there has been federal and state legislation and other reform initiatives regarding the coverage and reimbursement for COVID-19 diagnostic testing in response to the COVID-19 outbreak which continue to evolve. For example, effective January 15, 2022, private health insurance companies and group health plans are required to cover eight free over-the-counter at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests authorized, cleared, or approved by the FDA per covered individual per month.
 Data Privacy
 In the ordinary course of our business, we may process personal data and, accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy, security, and protection. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (EU GDPR), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (UK) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (UK GDPR), and the ePrivacy Directive. In addition, several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act.
The CCPA, EU GDPR, and UK GDPR are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal data processing may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures

related to a business’s collecting, using, and disclosing personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. In addition, it is anticipated that the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA), effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expand the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws may require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data.
European data privacy and security laws (including the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. For example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the European Economic Area (EEA) and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances.
 See the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks related to regulatory matters” for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
 Human capital resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 262 employees, 242 of whom were full-time employees. Our employees are located in Menlo Park, California, Chicago, Illinois and other locations inside and outside the United States. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
