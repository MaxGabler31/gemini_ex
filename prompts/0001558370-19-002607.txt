 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 General 
 We are a leading specialty retailer of men’s tailored clothing, and the largest men’s formalwear provider in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. We help men look and feel their best by offering a broad selection of clothing including suits, suit separates, sport coats, slacks, formalwear, business casual, denim, sportswear, outerwear, dress shirts, shoes and accessories.  We serve our customers through an expansive omni-channel network that includes over 1,400 stores in the U.S. and Canada as well as our branded e-commerce websites at www.menswearhouse.com, www.josbank.com, and www.josephabboud.com.   
 Our U.S. retail stores operate under the Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank, Joseph Abboud and K&G brand names and are located in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our Canadian stores operate under the Moores brand name and are located in 10 Canadian provinces. As of February 2, 2019, the Company operated 1,464 stores throughout the U.S. and Canada.  These operations comprise our retail segment.  
 We also own and operate a factory located in New Bedford, Massachusetts that manufactures quality U.S. made tailored clothing consisting of designer suits (including custom suits), tuxedos, sport coats and slacks that we sell in our Men’s Wearhouse stores, our Joseph Abboud flagship store and via our e-commerce websites.  We also sell Joseph Abboud branded tailored clothing in our Moores stores, which is produced by a third party in Canada.
 Additionally, we operate an international corporate apparel business with operations in both the United Kingdom (“UK”) and the U.S. Our UK-based business is the largest provider of corporate apparel in the UK under the Dimensions, Alexandra and Yaffy brands.  In the U.S., our corporate apparel business operates under the Twin Hill brand name.  Our corporate apparel business provides corporate clothing uniforms and workwear to workforces through multiple channels including managed corporate accounts, catalogs and the internet. 
     In prior periods, we owned and operated MW Cleaners, consisting of 38 retail dry cleaning, laundry and heirlooming facilities in Texas.  On March 3, 2018, we divested MW Cleaners for approximately $18.0 million.  
     Retail Segment
 Overview
 In our retail segment, we offer our products and services primarily through our retail brands—Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank, Moores, Joseph Abboud, and K&G—and through the internet at www.menswearhouse.com, www.josbank.com, and www.josephabboud.com. Men’s Wearhouse, Moores and K&G each operate as a house of brands carrying a wide selection of exclusive and non‑exclusive merchandise brands. Jos. A. Bank is a branded house where substantially all merchandise is sold under the exclusive Jos. A. Bank label. Joseph Abboud is our premium brand that is sold at Men’s Wearhouse and Moores and in our Joseph Abboud flagship store in New York.   Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux and Moores
 Men’s Wearhouse and Moores target the male consumer (18 to 65 years old) by providing superior, personalized customer service and offering a broad selection of exclusive and non‑exclusive merchandise brands at regular and sale prices that we believe are competitive with specialty retailers and traditional department stores. Our merchandise includes suits, suit separates, sport coats, slacks, formalwear, business casual, denim, sportswear, outerwear, dress shirts, shoes and accessories in classic, modern, slim and ultra-slim fits and in a wide range of sizes including a selection of “Big and Tall” product.
 Although basic styles comprise our core offerings, each season’s merchandise reflects current fit, fabric style and color trends. The inventory mix at our Men’s Wearhouse and Moores stores primarily consists of business, formalwear and business casual merchandise designed to meet the demand of our customers. Based on our experience, we believe that our assortment styling, breadth, quality and price coupled with our in-store service, provides us with an advantage over our competitors with our target customer.

 During fiscal 2016, we introduced a new collection of custom apparel consisting of suits, sport coats, slacks, shirts, tuxedos and vests, which are personalized according to a customer’s selection from a variety of attribute-value combinations. In both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, we experienced a significant increase in sales for custom clothing.  See “Business Strategy” for additional information on our custom clothing business and other strategic initiatives for 2019 and beyond.
 We also offer a full selection of special occasion offerings including tuxedo and suit rental product (collectively, “rental product”). We believe our rental product broadens our customer base by drawing first‑time and younger customers into our stores.  During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, we also experienced a trend by customers to purchase suits for special occasions instead of renting product.  Regardless of whether our customer chooses to purchase or rent, we believe we are well-positioned to meet our customers’ special occasion needs.
 At February 2, 2019, we operated 719 Men’s Wearhouse retail apparel stores in 50 states and the District of Columbia. These stores are referred to as “Men’s Wearhouse stores” or “full line stores” that offer a full selection of retail merchandise and rental product. Men’s Wearhouse stores are primarily located in regional strip and specialty retail shopping centers or in freestanding buildings as we believe that men prefer direct and easy store access that enables our customers to park near the entrance of the store.
 At February 2, 2019, we also operated another 46 stores in 22 states branded as Men’s Wearhouse and Tux. These stores are referred to as “rental stores” and offer a full selection of rental product and a limited selection of retail merchandise, and are located primarily in regional malls and lifestyle centers.  Since 2013, we have closed over 200 Men’s Wearhouse and Tux stores, consistent with our strategy to serve special occasion customers primarily through our full line stores.
 At February 2, 2019, we operated 126 Moores retail apparel stores in 10 Canadian provinces. Moores stores are primarily located in regional strip and specialty retail shopping centers.
 Jos. A. Bank
 Jos. A. Bank targets the male consumer (25 to 65 years old) emphasizing superior, personalized customer service and offering high quality, business, formalwear and business casual merchandise, substantially all of which is Jos. A. Bank branded product including our Reserve and 1905 labels. Jos. A. Bank merchandise consists of suits, suit separates, sport coats, slacks, formalwear, business casual, denim, sportswear, outerwear, dress shirts, shoes and accessories in classic, modern, slim and ultra-slim fits and in a wide range of sizes including a selection of “Big and Tall” product.  Although the target gender and age of the Jos. A. Bank customer are similar to Men’s Wearhouse, we believe the Jos. A. Bank customer and the Men’s Wearhouse customer are distinct in their style preferences and, based on information from our loyalty programs, we believe that there is minimal overlap between the Jos. A. Bank customer and the Men’s Wearhouse customer.  
 Our merchandising strategy is focused on classic styling with attention to detail in quality materials and workmanship. Based on our experience, we believe that our assortment styling, breadth, quality and price coupled with our in-store service, provides us with an advantage over our competitors with our target customer.
 During fiscal 2016, we introduced custom apparel at Jos. A. Bank consisting of suits, sport coats, slacks, shirts, tuxedos and vests, which are personalized according to a customer’s selection from a variety of attribute-value combinations.  Similar to Men’s Wearhouse and Moores, we experienced a significant increase in sales for custom clothing in both fiscal 2017 and 2018.  See “Business Strategy” for additional information on our custom clothing business and other strategic initiatives for 2019 and beyond.
 We also offer a full selection of special occasion rental product at Jos. A. Bank and believe our rental product offering provides the opportunity to broaden our customer base by drawing first‑time and younger customers into our stores.  As is the case at Men’s Wearhouse, we believe Jos. A. Bank is well-positioned to meet its customers’ special occasion needs, through retail clothing offerings, rental product or custom offerings.
 At February 2, 2019, we operated 484 Jos. A. Bank retail apparel stores in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Jos. A. Bank stores are primarily located in specialty retail centers. In addition, as of February 2, 2019, there are 14 franchise stores.

 K&G
 K&G stores offer a value‑oriented superstore approach that we believe appeals to the more price‑sensitive customer in the apparel market. K&G offers first‑quality, current‑season apparel and accessories comparable in quality to that of value-oriented department stores, at prices we believe are typically up to 60% below the regular prices charged by such stores. K&G’s merchandising strategy emphasizes broad assortments across all major categories of both men’s and women’s career and casual apparel in a wide range of sizes including “Big and Tall” and “Women’s plus sizes” as well as tailored clothing, dress furnishings, sportswear, accessories, shoes and children’s apparel. This merchandise selection, which includes exclusive and non‑exclusive merchandise brands, positions K&G to attract a wide range of customers in each of its markets.
 At February 2, 2019, we operated 88 K&G stores in 27 states, 84 of which offer women’s career apparel, sportswear, accessories, shoes and children’s apparel. K&G stores are “destination” stores located primarily in second generation strip shopping centers that are easily accessible from major highways and thoroughfares.
 Business Strategy
 To fulfill our mission of helping men feel and look their best, we believe we need to:

· | Offer personalized products and services;
--+------------------------------------------


· | Provide inspiring and seamless experiences in and across every channel; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Build brands that stand for something more than just price.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

  Offer Personalized Products and Services
 In 2018, our custom clothing business more than doubled to over $220 million, or approximately 9% of retail clothing product net sales, compared to over $100 million in fiscal 2017.  Our custom clothing offerings are available at all Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores locations with two initial price points: an entry-level offering and a premium offering.  
 Our focus for the custom business has been on three key aspects that we believe are crucial to the customer: speed, selection and service.  We believe we have significant competitive advantages in these areas because we have:  1) supply chain advantages with our owned factory that manufactures our premium custom clothing in the U.S. and strong relationships and scale advantages with foreign manufacturers for our entry level custom clothing, 2) a wide assortment of custom suit fabrics to create high-quality and unique products for our customers and 3) a convenient U.S. and Canada store footprint staffed by expert wardrobe consultants and tailors.
 However, we believe that delivering personalized products and services extends beyond our custom clothing offerings.  Given the continuing trend in casualization of workplace and special occasion attire, we plan to accelerate the evolution of our assortments to a mix that better reflects the way men dress for moments that matter.  
 Provide Inspiring and Seamless Experiences In and Across Every Channel
 We want our customers to be able to shop whenever, wherever and however they choose and to have inspiring and seamless experiences in and across every channel.  
 Although our convenient U.S. and Canada store footprint continues to be a significant asset, we believe that the location, look, feel and functioning of our stores has not kept up with the evolving customer’s expectations.  As a result, we believe that we need to invest more in our store fleet.  For example, through the end of 2018, we have installed 580 custom clothing fixtures across the Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores stores to provide a better custom suit buying experience.  Beginning in 2019, we expect to make more dramatic changes in our store fleet and plan to accelerate the pace at which we execute the changes, such as enhancements to make it easier for our customers to shop and improved visual displays.  
 Our current e-commerce capabilities include ‘virtualized inventory’ that enables our customers to order items through our websites when not available at the store. We can also ship online purchases from our stores to further enhance our 

 
  5

 
customer’s online shopping experience and reduce delivery times.  In addition, we offer a guided shopping experience called “Look Finder” that provides customers with product recommendations. In 2019, we intend to continue to build on delivering personalized, high-tech, high-touch service online including critical investments in technologies, business processes and personnel, such as improvements in website speed, navigation and visual merchandising.
 Beyond our store and e-commerce channels, we believe that marketing is an important element of the omni-channel experience. In 2017 and 2018, we began evolving our marketing mix, dedicating a greater share of our marketing mix to digital channels to target a broader customer segment.  We believe this advertising strategy is the most effective means of both attracting potential new customers as well as reinforcing the positive attributes of our various brands with our existing customer base.  In 2019, we expect to continue to shift our marketing mix into broad reach digital channels that are more relevant, more easily personalized, and whose performance is more easily measured.
 Build Brands That Stand for Something More than Just Price
 Historically, our advertising strategy was primarily focused on promotional messaging including channels such as television, email, digital (including social media), mobile and direct mail.  We believe that our target customers increasingly want to do business with brands that stand for more than just a discounted price.  As a result, in 2017 and 2018 we began shifting our advertising messaging away from pure promotional messaging, placing more emphasis on the quality of our product offerings and our high-touch customer service.  
 In 2019, we plan to continue to use marketing strategies to emphasize the reasons why men should shop with us beyond just price. This approach will continue to focus on our in-store experience to promote a more engaged, personalized shopping experience that features our wardrobe consultants who help men create their personal style.  We intend to build customer loyalty by gaining a greater understanding of our customer’s needs, helping him meet those needs, and giving him confidence in the way he looks.  In addition, we plan to strengthen our company reputation for social responsibility and grow brand affinity through our national suit drives in the U.S. and Canada, merchandise donations and social cause campaigns that resonate with our target customers.  
 Customer Service and Loyalty
 Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank, Joseph Abboud and Moores sales personnel are trained as consultants to provide customers with assistance and advice on their apparel needs, including product style, color coordination, fabric choice and garment fit. Wardrobe consultants are encouraged to offer guidance to the customer at each stage of the decision‑making process, making every effort to earn the customer’s confidence and to create a professional relationship that will continue beyond the initial visit.
 K&G stores are designed to allow customers to select and purchase apparel by themselves. For example, each merchandise category is clearly marked and organized by size, and suits are specifically tagged as a means of further assisting customers to easily select their styles and sizes. K&G employees are also available to assist customers with merchandise selection, including correct sizing.
 Substantially all of our retail apparel stores offer tailoring services to facilitate timely alterations at a reasonable cost to customers. In addition, we utilize our regional tailor shops, which receive merchandise from stores to perform tailoring services and return the merchandise to the store for customer pickup.
 We offer our “Perfect Fit” loyalty program to our Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux and Moores customers and our “Bank Account” loyalty program for Jos. A. Bank customers.  Under these loyalty programs, customers receive points for purchases. Points are generally equivalent to dollars spent on a one‑for‑one basis. Upon reaching 500 points, customers are issued a $50 rewards certificate that they may use to make purchases at our stores or online. All customers who register for our loyalty programs are eligible to participate and earn points for purchases. We believe that the loyalty programs facilitate our ability to cultivate long‑term relationships with our customers.
 Purchasing and Distribution
 For the Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores brands and, to a lesser extent, our K&G brand, our vertical direct sourcing model with third‑party manufacturers covers design, product development, manufacturing, testing, quality control, and all necessary logistics required to get merchandise from the factory to the sales floor. We purchase 

 
  6

 
merchandise and rental product from a broad base of manufacturers and do not believe that the loss of any manufacturer would cause a significant negative impact to us. We have no material long‑term merchandise manufacturing contracts and typically transact business on a purchase order‑by‑purchase order basis either directly with manufacturers and fabric mills or with trading companies. We have developed long‑term and reliable relationships with most of our direct manufacturers and fabric mills, which we believe provides stability, quality and price leverage. Furthermore, we work with trading companies that support our relationships with manufacturers for our direct-sourced merchandise and contract agent offices that provide administrative functions on our behalf. The agent offices provide all quality control inspections and ensure that our operating procedures manuals are adhered to by our manufacturers.    We are committed to social responsibility and environmental stewardship and have long supported the work of international agencies and organizations that seek to implement internationally recognized standards for labor practices.  We have developed and implemented a Supplier Code of Conduct that sets forth the compliance requirements that all suppliers must meet to do business with us. Our risk management department oversees our factory compliance efforts, and we also use the services of an outside audit company to conduct regular audits of factories we use.  We strive to work collaboratively with our clothing factories to positively influence them to embed compliance into their daily operations.  We also maintain standards and guidelines related to human trafficking and slavery and our managers with direct responsibility for supply chain management have attended training, particularly with respect to mitigating these risks within the supply chain.  For additional information regarding our commitment to improving factory working conditions, please review our 2018 Sustainability Report, which is available on our website at www.tailoredbrands.com.
 In fiscal 2017, we reported that our retail brands sourced approximately 66% of direct sourced merchandise from Asia (39% from China) while 11% was sourced in the U.S. (primarily from our U.S. factory), 6% was sourced in Mexico and 17% was sourced in other regions.  Our historical practice was to include raw materials sourced in foreign countries even if the finished goods using those raw materials were manufactured in a different country.  As the U.S. has recently imposed tariffs on certain imports from China, we believe revising our historical practice to report the amount of finished goods manufactured in foreign countries is more meaningful to investors to evaluate the impact of current or future tariffs on imports from China.  For fiscal 2017, our revised metrics reflect that our retail brands sourced approximately 74% of direct sourced merchandise from Asia (30% from China) while 9% was sourced in the U.S. (primarily from our U.S. factory), 6% was sourced in Mexico and 11% was sourced in other regions.  
     In fiscal 2018, our retail brands sourced approximately 72% of direct sourced merchandise from Asia (23% from China) while 9% was sourced in Mexico, 8% was sourced in the U.S. (primarily from our U.S. factory) and 11% was sourced in other regions. Substantially all of our foreign purchases are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. 
     We use a regional distribution center approach to leverage the geographic locations of our main distribution centers in Texas and Maryland, as well as the hub facilities described below.  Merchandise received into these regional distribution centers is either placed in back‑stock or allocated to a store for shipping. In the majority of our larger markets, we also have separate hub distribution facilities or space within certain stores used as redistribution facilities for their respective areas. Merchandise for Moores is distributed to the stores from our distribution center in Montreal, Quebec. The majority of merchandise for our K&G stores is direct shipped by suppliers to the stores with the remainder of K&G merchandise being managed via a third‑party logistics firm. 
 In 2018, to better align our operations with an increasing consumer preference to purchase suits or formalwear for their special occasion needs instead of renting product, we closed one of our rental product distribution centers.  As a result, our rental product is now located in six distribution facilities:  our Houston, Texas distribution center and five additional distribution facilities located in the U.S. (four) and Canada (one). The five additional distribution facilities also receive limited quantities of retail product, primarily formalwear accessories, that is sold in our Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank and Moores stores.
 All retail merchandise and new rental product transported from suppliers to our distribution facilities is done so via common carrier or on a dedicated fleet of long‑haul vehicles. This dedicated fleet is also used to transport product from our distribution centers to the hub facilities and a fleet of leased or owned smaller vehicles is used to transport product from the hub facilities to our stores within a given geographic region.

 Competition
 We compete against a broad spectrum of other men’s clothing stores. Our primary competitors include traditional department stores, other specialty men’s clothing stores, online retailers, online formalwear rental providers, off‑price retailers, manufacturer‑owned and independently‑owned outlet stores, independently-owned formalwear rental stores, and all of their respective e-commerce channels. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the men’s apparel market are merchandise assortment, quality, value, garment fit, merchandise presentation, store location and customer service, including on‑site tailoring.
 We believe that our merchandise offerings, including exclusive brands and custom clothing, and emphasis on customer service distinguish us from other retailers. Certain of our competitors (principally department stores) are larger and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have and, therefore, they may have certain competitive advantages over us.
 Corporate Apparel 
 Overview
 Our international corporate apparel business operates under the Dimensions, Alexandra and Yaffy brands primarily in the UK and Europe, and Twin Hill in the U.S., and provides corporate clothing uniforms and workwear to workforces. We offer our corporate apparel clothing products through multiple channels including managed corporate accounts, catalogs and the internet at www.dimensions.co.uk, www.alexandra.co.uk, and www.twinhill.com. We offer a wide variety of customer branded apparel such as shirts, blouses, trousers, skirts and suits as well as a wide range of other products, from aprons to safety vests to high visibility police outerwear. With respect to our managed contracts, we generally provide complete management of our customers’ corporate clothing programs.
 During 2018, the performance of our corporate apparel business was, and will continue to be, impacted by increasing uncertainty surrounding the UK’s exit from the European Union (“EU”) (commonly known as Brexit), which is resulting in lower replenishment demand from existing accounts in the UK.  In addition, in the third quarter of 2018, we received notification from a significant U.S. customer of their decision not to renew their existing agreement with us in 2019. As a result of the continued uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the notification from our U.S. customer, we lowered our forecast of sales, profitability and cash flow for the corporate apparel business for the fourth quarter of 2018 and future years. 
     As a result of the factors above, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $24.0 million during the third quarter of 2018.  See Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements and Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets within ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates’’ for further details.
     We are committed to an ongoing evaluation of our portfolio of businesses and maximizing value for our shareholders.  Such an evaluation may result in the consideration of a range of options related to our corporate apparel business, some of which could result in additional non-cash losses in future periods.
     Customer Service and Marketing
 Our customer base includes companies and organizations in the airline, retail grocery, retail, banking, quick service restaurants, car rental, distribution, travel and leisure, postal, security, healthcare and public sectors. Sector characteristics and economics tend to impact the corporate wear requirements of our individual customers. For example, retail customers typically have high staff turnover levels resulting in large replenishment volumes and significant seasonal demand, while banking customers generally have lower turnover and replenishment requirements but refresh or rebrand uniforms more frequently. 
 Our managed contract customers are generally organizations with larger numbers of uniform-wearing employees or those that use uniforms as a form of brand identity. We have long established relationships with many of the UK’s top employers and we currently maintain approximately 30 managed accounts with an average account size greater than 15,000 wearers. 
 Under our managed contracts, we are the exclusive supplier of corporate wear to our customers’ employees. Because of the nature of the managed contract model, we ensure that we are fully involved in all of our customers’ uniform requirements, from daily replenishment requirements to longer term rebranding plans and wider corporate wear strategy. 

 
  8

 
As a result, our relationship and level of interaction with our customers is generally far deeper and more embedded than conventional customer‑supplier relationships.
 Managed contracts are generally awarded through a request for proposal or tender process for multi‑year contracts. Our teams continually monitor market opportunities to obtain access to such contracts. Regular contact with corporate wear buyers is supplemented with mail campaigns, attendance at trade fairs and trade magazine advertisements. From time to time, we provide each managed contract customer with a specific account manager who often works one or two days a week on‑site at our larger customers’ offices. In addition to maintaining customer requirements, the account manager is also responsible for suggesting and implementing ways of improving the customer’s corporate wear process.
 Our catalogs are distributed electronically, via mail and by sales representatives to current and potential customers. The catalogs offer a full or curated range of our products and offer further branding or embellishment of most products ordered. Catalog orders can be placed via phone, mail, fax or direct contact with our sales representatives and, in the U.S., via client‑specific websites. Our UK e‑commerce platforms also allow online ordering via our websites and provide 24‑hour functionality, with a full list of our products and their details. Our typical catalog customers are small-to-medium sized organizations with a relatively smaller number of employees or organizations where brand differentiation is not imperative.  In addition, we regularly develop dedicated websites for our corporate clients for use by their employees in ordering their company specific corporate wear.
 Merchandising
 In our corporate apparel business, we work with our customers to create custom apparel programs designed to support and enhance their respective brands. Our comprehensive apparel collections, including basic apparel categories such as shirts, blouses, trousers, skirts and suits, as well as a wide range of other products from aprons to safety vests to high visibility police outerwear, feature designs with sizes and fits that meet the performance needs of our customers’ employees and utilize the latest technology in long‑wearing fabrications. Career wear, casual wear and workwear make up an increasingly significant portion of the product mix as service industry customers continue to grow.
 Under our managed contracts, our customers work with our in‑house design and technical teams to design and develop uniforms or other corporate wear that creates strong brand identity. We utilize our management information and garment tracking system to highlight trends, identify issues and provide benchmark data for the customer at all levels from individual wearer to enterprise‑wide. This system also allows us to identify potential cost savings and develop solutions on behalf of our customers and to respond quickly to trends or other changing needs.
 With respect to our UK catalog and internet operations, customers can design an off‑the‑rack program that provides custom alterations and embroidery on any of our standard, ready‑to‑wear clothing. We work with such customers to create a distinctive, branded program that may include the addition of a company logo or other custom trim.
 Purchasing and Distribution
 All corporate apparel garment production is outsourced to third‑party manufacturers, including fabric mills, through our direct sourcing programs. We have developed long‑term relationships with most of our direct manufacturers and fabric mills, which we believe provides stability, quality and reliability. We do not have any material long‑term contracts with our manufacturers and we do not believe that the loss of any manufacturer would significantly impact us. Where appropriate, we work with contract agent offices that support our relationships with our direct source suppliers and provide administrative functions on our behalf.  In addition, the agent offices assist with quality control inspections and ensure that our manufacturers adhere to our operating procedures manuals.  Also, we operate a dedicated liaison office in Bangladesh to perform these functions.
 During 2018, approximately 60% of our corporate wear product purchases was sourced in Asia (primarily China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia) while approximately 40% was sourced from Europe and other regions. Our foreign purchases from Asia are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars, while our purchases from Europe and other regions are negotiated and paid for in British pounds, Euros or U.S. dollars.
 As a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative (“ETI”) since 2007, our UK-based supply chain operations have adopted the internationally recognized ETI Base Code of labor practice as part of their efforts to improve working conditions and uphold human rights in an environmentally friendly workplace for the benefit of manufacturers.  In addition our UK operations have written and published on their website their Modern Slavery Statement in accordance with the UK’s Modern Slavery Act of 2015.  

 
  9

 

 To oversee compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct, we use internal resources as well as third party companies to audit the factories producing our garments. We strive to work collaboratively with clothing factories to positively influence them to embed compliance into their daily operations.
 Corporate apparel merchandise is received into our distribution facilities located in Long Eaton and Glasgow for the UK operations and Houston, Texas and Bakersfield, California for U.S. operations. Customer orders are dispatched to the customer or individual wearers employed by the customer via common carrier or pursuant to other arrangements specified by the customer.
 Competition
 Our UK corporate apparel group provides workwear and uniforms to more UK employees than any of our corporate apparel competitors, which consist mostly of smaller, niche providers or companies that focus more on catalog business. The U.S. corporate wear market is more fragmented with several U.S. competitors being larger and having more resources than Twin Hill. We believe that the competitive factors in the corporate wear market are merchandise assortment, quality, price, lead times, customer service and delivery capabilities. We believe that our proven capability in the provision of corporate apparel programs to businesses and organizations of all sizes alongside our catalog and internet operations position us well with our existing customers and should enable us to continue to gain new catalog accounts and managed contracts. Seasonality
 Our sales and net earnings are subject to seasonal fluctuations and may vary by brand. Typically, our rental product revenues are heavily concentrated in the second and third quarters (prom and wedding season) while the fourth quarter is the seasonal low point.  With respect to corporate apparel sales and operating results, seasonal fluctuations are not significant but the acquisition of new customers or existing customer decisions to rebrand or revise their corporate wear programs can cause significant variations in period results. Because of these fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year. Trademarks and Service Marks
 We are the owner in the U.S. and selected other countries of the numerous trademarks and service marks we use including, without limitation, MEN’S WEARHOUSE, MW MEN’S WEARHOUSE (and design), JOS. A. BANK, and JOSEPH ABBOUD and of U.S. and foreign registrations for such marks.  Our rights in the MEN’S WEARHOUSE, JOS. A. BANK, JOSEPH ABBOUD, and other marks and their respective variations are a significant part of our business, as the marks have become well known through our use of the marks in connection with our retail and formalwear rental services and products (both in store and online) and our advertising campaigns.  We are also the owner of various other trademarks and service marks, and corresponding trademark registrations in the U.S., Canada and abroad under which our stores and corporate apparel business operate or which are used to label the products we sell or rent. We intend to maintain and protect our marks and the related registrations.
 We also license the JOSEPH ABBOUD brand to certain third parties for limited products in the U.S. and Canada, and for a broader range of products in select countries abroad.
 We are the licensee for certain designer labels on various products such as men’s suits, men’s formalwear or men’s shirts. We generally pay a royalty for the use of the label, based on cost for the relevant product or a percentage of related sales. We monitor the performance of these licensed labels compared to their cost and may elect to selectively terminate any license, as provided in the particular agreement. 
 Employees
 At February 2, 2019, we had approximately 20,600 employees, consisting of approximately 18,100 in the U.S. and 2,500 in foreign countries, of which approximately 15,100 were full‑time employees. Seasonality affects the number of part‑time employees as well as the number of hours worked by full‑time and part‑time personnel.
 At February 2, 2019, approximately 770 of our employees at the factory located in New Bedford, Massachusetts are members of Unite Here, a New England based labor union. The current union contract is scheduled to expire in April 2019 and we are currently engaged in negotiations to enter into a new collective bargaining agreement.  At February 2, 2019, 

 
  10

 
approximately 25 of our employees at our distribution center located in Quebec, Canada are members of Service Employees Union, Local 800. The current union contract expires in November 2023.
 Also, approximately 190 employees working in the Jos. A. Bank Hampstead, Maryland tailoring overflow shop and distribution centers are represented by the Mid‑Atlantic Regional Joint Board, Local 806. The current union contract expires in February 2020. Lastly, approximately 80 Jos. A. Bank sales associates in New York City and four surrounding New York counties are represented by Local 340, New York New Jersey Regional Joint Board, Workers United.
