 Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW AND HISTORY 
 HealthStream, Inc. (HealthStream or the Company) provides workforce and provider solutions for healthcare organizationsall designed to support the people that deliver patient care which, in turn, supports the improvement of business and clinical outcomes. Delivered primarily as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), our solutions focus on some of the most significant challenges facing the healthcare workforce and healthcare organizations today, including the need to effectively manage, retain, engage, and develop healthcare workforce talent; meet rigorous compliance requirements; and efficiently manage ongoing medical staff credentialing and privileging processes. 
 On February 12, 2018, the Company divested its Patient Experience (PX) business to Press Ganey Associates (Press Ganey) for $65.5 million in cash (subject to adjustment based on the working capital of the PX business at closing). This sale of the PX business resulted in the Companys divestiture of the Companys patient experience solutions business segment. 
 With 28 years of experience, HealthStream is recognized as a leading innovator and thought leader in the healthcare industry for its healthcare workforce solutions. Using technology to enhance learning and productivity, HealthStream pioneered the delivery of online learning for hospitals required regulatory training as Internet-based training was first introduced. Stemming from that early success, demand for expanded learning solutions led the Company to build what is now a full eco-system of diverse HR and clinical-focused applications, courseware, assessments, and talent management programs. At year-end 2017, with approximately 4.77 million healthcare professionals subscribing to HealthStreams platform through their respective organizations, HealthStream is a leading provider in workforce development in the healthcare industry. 
 With its singular healthcare focus, HealthStream understands that healthcare organizations want to provide their patients with an engaged, confident, and competent workforce that delivers optimal patient experiences. HealthStreams solutions include a robust array of products and services that provide targeted insights for organizations to take actions that produce sustainable performance improvements. Moreover, HealthStreams vast database of healthcare workforce benchmarks offer organizations a powerful tool to compare, assess, and fine-tune their strategies for managing initiatives for success. 
 HealthStream believes that the key to quality patient care isand always has beenthe people who deliver care. To that end, the Companys solutions support the recruiting, retaining, engaging, assessing, and developing of the healthcare workforce, including medical staff who provide patient care in our customers organizations. 
 Headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, the Company was incorporated in 1990 and began providing its SaaS-based workforce solutions in 1999, its survey and research solutions in 2005 (which business we divested in February 2018 as noted above), and its provider solutions in 2012. Including additional offices in Columbia, Maryland (prior to the divestment of our PX business); Nashville, Tennessee; Jericho, New York; Brentwood, Tennessee; San Diego, California; Chicago, Illinois; and Boulder, Colorado, HealthStream had 955 full-time and 72 part-time employees as of December 31, 2017 (prior to giving effect to the divestment of our PX business). In addition, as of February 22, 2018, HealthStream had 719 full-time and 27 part-time employees. Our business has evolved from an initial focus on technology-based training to a company providing workforce development and provider solutions to the nations healthcare providers. 
 INDUSTRY BACKGROUND 
 According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), spending in the healthcare industry reached approximately $3.3 trillion in 2016, or 17.9% of the U.S. gross domestic product. Hospital care expenditures accounted for approximately 32.4% of the $3.3 trillion industry. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, approximately 19.6 million professionals are employed in the healthcare segment of the domestic economy, with approximately 5.2 million employed in acute-care hospitals and approximately 3.3 million employed in post-acute-care organizations, our primary target markets for our products. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 4.77 million healthcare professionals were subscribers to our SaaS-based solutions, which include 4.65 million subscribers already implemented and 118,000 subscribers in the process of implementation. 
 
1 
 
All of the approximately 5.2 million hospital-based healthcare professionals that work in the nations approximately 5,000 acute-care hospitals are required by federal and state mandates and accrediting bodies to complete training in a number of areas. This training includes safety training mandated by both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and The Joint Commission (an independent, not-for-profit organization that accredits and certifies healthcare organizations and programs in the United States), as well as training on patient information confidentiality required under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 
 In hospitals, staffing issues and personnel shortages have also contributed to the need for facility-based workforce development as well as additional assessment and competency-based training. An ongoing nursing shortage, for example, is resulting in skill gaps and rising costs. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the need for 525,000 replacement nurses over the next several years, bringing the total number of openings for nurses due to growth and replacements to 1.05 million by 2022. We believe that offering training and education for hospital personnel is increasingly being utilized as a retention and recruitment incentive. 
 Many healthcare professionals use continuing education to keep abreast of the latest developments and meet licensing and certification requirements. Continuing education is required for nurses, emergency medical services personnel, first responder personnel, radiologic personnel, and physicians. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies must also provide their medical industry sales representatives with training mandated for the healthcare industry and training for new products. Such companies also provide support and content for education and training of audiences that use their products in healthcare organizations. 
 The healthcare education and training industry is highly fragmented, varies significantly in delivery methods (i.e., online products, live events, written materials, and manikins for simulation-based training), and is composed of a wide variety of entities competing for customers. The sheer volume of healthcare information available to satisfy continuing education needs, rapid advances in medical developments, and the time constraints that healthcare professionals face make it difficult to quickly and efficiently access the continuing education content most relevant to an individuals practice or profession. Historically, healthcare professionals have received continuing education and training through offline publications, such as medical journals or by attending conferences and seminars. In addition, other healthcare workers and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers sales and internal regulatory personnel usually fulfill their training from external vendors or internal training departments. While these approaches satisfy the ongoing education and training requirements, they are typically costly and inconvenient. In addition, live courses are often limited in the breadth of offerings and do not provide a method for tracking training completion. The results of these traditional methods, both from a business and compliance standpoint, are difficult to track and measure. While hospitals and health systems occasionally survey their patients, physicians, and employees using their own internal resources, the practice is limited since they do not typically possess the valuable comparative benchmarking data that is available from independent survey research vendors. 
 Provider data management has become more complex and arduous for healthcare organizations. Spurred by The Joint Commission Medical Staff standards and other regulatory requirements, credentialing and privileging has been transformed from a periodic review to continuous, evidence-driven analysis of professional competency and provider performance. This transformation requires ongoing, automatic monitoring of licenses, sanctions, and exclusions, as well as expanding the scope of review at initial credentialing and re-credentialing. In addition, provider enrollment processes have compounded in difficulty. For example, a single provider may need to enroll annually with some 30 to 40 payers, with each payer application often taking two to four hours to complete. 
 Finally, the hospital industry continues to operate under intense pressure to reduce costs as a result of reductions in government reimbursement rates and increased focus on cost containment consistent with participation of patients in managed care programs. In addition, hospitals, as well as pharmaceutical and medical device companies, continue to experience rising operating costs, coupled with increased pressure to measure and report on the outcomes of the dollars spent on training. Our products and services are designed to meet these needs by reducing healthcare organizations costs of training while improving learning outcomes, enhancing reporting capabilities, and supporting customers business objectives. 
 HEALTHSTREAMS SOLUTIONS 
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, HealthStreams products and services were organized into three segmentsWorkforce Solutions, Patient Experience Solutions, and Provider Solutionsthat collectively help healthcare organizations meet their ongoing talent management, training, education, assessment, competency management, compliance, provider credentialing & privileging management, and provider enrollment needs. HealthStreams solutions are provided to a wide range of customers within the healthcare industry across the continuum of care. On February 12, 2018, the Company divested its PX business to Press Ganey for $65.5 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on the working capital of such business as of the closing. This sale of the PX business resulted in the Companys complete divestiture of the Companys patient experience solutions business segment. 
 HealthStream Workforce Solutions Our workforce development solutions, which are comprised primarily of SaaS, subscription-based products, are used by healthcare organizations to meet a broad range of their talent management, training, certification, competency assessment, performance appraisal, and development needs. Our numerous content libraries allow our customers to subscribe to a wide array of additional courseware, which includes content from leading healthcare and nursing associations, medical and healthcare publishers, and other content providers. Additionally, medical device companies and other industry partners offer online training support through HealthStreams platform for their products and they sponsor continuing education directly to healthcare workers.

At December 31, 2017, HealthStream had approximately 4.77 million total subscribers to its subscription-based solutions. Each individual end-user who utilizes at least one HealthStream subscription-based solution is counted as one subscriber, regardless of the number of subscriptions contracted by or for that end-user. Our subscription-based solutions include any one or a combination of our many platform applications, plus courseware, or content. For example, we deliver courseware to our customers primarily through our learning application, the HealthStream Learning Center (HLC), while we deliver competency management and performance appraisal tools through our applications known as the HealthStream Competency Center (HCC) and HealthStream Performance Center (HPC), respectively, which are all on our SaaS-based platform, along with a series of other applications. 
 Pricing for the HLC, HCC, and HPC are subscription-based, with fees based on the number of subscribers, courseware provided, and other factors. We offer training, implementation, and account management services to facilitate adoption of our subscription-based solutions. Fees for training are based on the time and efforts of the personnel involved. Implementation fees vary based on the size, scope, and complexity of the project. Our SaaS-based platform and subscription-based solutions are hosted in a central data center that allows authorized subscribers access to our services through the Internet, thereby eliminating the need for onsite local implementations of installed workforce development products. During 2017, 2016, and 2015 our subscription-based workforce solutions accounted for approximately 69%, 71%, and 74% of consolidated revenues, respectively. 
 Other Applications on our Platform  HealthStream offers an array of other applications on our platform, each serving a unique function for hospitals and health systems. Each application on our platform has its own value proposition and revenue stream. Examples of individual applications that are offered on our platform include applications for recruiting and applicant tracking; learning; performance appraisal; compensation management; succession planning; competency management; credentialing and privileging; provider enrollment; disclosure management; clinical development; simulation-based education; and industry-sponsored training. 
 HealthStream Patient Experience Solutions  Prior to the disposition of our PX business in February 2018 as noted above, our patient experience solutions complemented our workforce solutions product and service offerings by providing customers with Patient Insights, Employee Insights, Physician Insights, and Community Insights surveys, data analyses of survey results, and other research-based measurement tools. Our services were designed to provide thorough analyses with insightful recommendations for change; benchmarking capability using our comprehensive databases; and consulting services to identify solutions for our customers based on their survey results. Clients were able to access and analyze their survey results data through Insights Online, our secure web-based reporting platform. During 2017, 2016, and 2015 our Patient Insights survey product accounted for approximately 11%, 12%, and 13% of consolidated revenues, respectively. 
 HealthStream Provider Solutions  Our provider solutions are offered through our business segment that is branded in the marketplace as Verity, a HealthStream Company. Verity, a HealthStream Company, delivers enterprise-class solutions to transform the healthcare provider experience for healthcare organizations and providers. We currently serve over 2,400 hospitals and 1,000 medical groups in the United States. Verity, a HealthStream Company, resulted from the combination of Echo, Inc. and Morrisey Associates, Inc. (MAI), representing over 75 years of industry experience, to become the leading company delivering solutions for credentialing, enrollment, privileging, onboarding, and performance evaluation for providers. Verity, a HealthStream Company, has over 200 employees spanning headquarters in Boulder, CO with satellite offices in San Diego, CA, Brentwood, TN, and Chicago, IL. 
 Our legacy products include EchoCredentialing and MSOW, comprehensive platforms that manage medical staff credentialing and privileging processes for hospitals; EchoOneApp, a provider enrollment platform for medical groups, which includes automatic form population directly from a continuously updated library of more than 4,500 preformatted payer form templates as well as online form integration with Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare, CMS, the Provider Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System (PECOS); and EchoAccess, our enterprise class platform to support hospital call centers with physician referral, call triage, provider directories, class enrollment, and discharge planning functionalities. 
 In January 2018, we announced the launch of our SaaS-based provider credentialing, privileging, and enrollment solution, Verity. Verity includes an intuitive, modern user experience; embedded, validated provider data; and evidence-based and best practice content. Further, Verity provides a single infrastructure supporting the entire provider lifecycle, from recruiting, application submission, validation tasks, privileging, appointments by credentialing committees, enrollment, contracting, onboarding, and performance management. 
 BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS 
 We acquired HealthLine Systems, LLC (HLS) in March 2015, acquired Performance Management Services, Inc. in June 2016, acquired the remaining ownership interest in Nursing Registry Consultants Corporation in July 2016, and acquired MAI in August 2016. For additional information regarding acquisitions, please see Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included elsewhere in this report. 
CUSTOMERS 
 We provide our solutions to customers across a broad range of entities within the healthcare industry, including private, not-for-profit, and government entities, as well as pharmaceutical and medical device companies. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of customers, although no single customer represented more than 10 percent of our revenues during 2017, 2016, or 2015. Customers that have purchased or contracted for products and services from HealthStream include: Ardent Health

 Services; Saint Lukes Health System; HCA Holdings, Inc.; Community Health Systems, Inc.; McLaren Health Care Corporation; Sutter Health; and Tenet Healthcare Corporation. 
 SALES AND MARKETING 
 We market our products and services primarily through our direct sales teams, which are based out of our corporate headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee and in our additional offices located in Jericho, New York; Brentwood, Tennessee; San Diego, California; and Chicago, Illinois, as well as remote home office sales locations. We also had an office in Columbia, Maryland prior to our disposition of the PX business. As of December 31, 2017, our HealthStream Workforce Solutions sales personnel consisted of 120 employees who carried sales quotas; our HealthStream Patient Experience Solutions sales personnel consisted of 12 employees who carried sales quotas (such Patient Experience Solutions sales personnel are no longer employed by us following the disposition of the PX business); and our Provider Solutions sales personnel consisted of 31 employees who carried sales quotas. As of December 31, 2017, we also had 13 employees who support our sales teams with sales force productivity and optimization, onboarding, training, and administration services. 
 We conduct a variety of marketing programs to promote our products and services, including product catalogs, user groups, trade shows, internet promotion and demonstrations, telemarketing campaigns, public relations, distribution of product-specific literature, direct mail, and advertising. We have marketing teams that are responsible for these initiatives and for working with and supporting our product management and sales teams. At December 31, 2017, our marketing personnel consisted of 40 employees. 
 OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY 
 We believe our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer relationships, obtain recurring sales, and develop and maintain new and existing products are dependent on the strength of our operations, customer service, product development and maintenance, training, and other support teams. As of December 31, 2017, our Workforce Solutions operations team consisted of 306 employees associated with customer support, implementation services, product development and quality assurance, training, and project management; our Patient Experience Solutions operations team consisted of 253 employees (of which 106 employees worked in our interviewing centers) associated with phone interviewing, distributing and processing paper-based survey instruments, patient experience coaching and consulting, data analysis and reporting of survey results, and project management (the Patient Experience Solutions operations team employees are no longer employed by us following the disposition of the PX business); and our Provider Solutions operations team consisted of 173 employees associated with implementation services, data integration, product development and quality assurance, credentials verification, consulting, and other functions. 
 Our services are designed to be reliable, secure, and scalable. Our software is a combination of proprietary and commercially available software and operating systems. Our software solutions support hosting and management of content, publication of our websites, execution of courseware, registration and tracking of users, collection, sampling, and analysis of survey data, tracking and reporting of physician credentialing and provider enrollment information, and reporting of information for both internal and external use. We designed the platforms that provide our services to allow each component to be independently scaled by adding commercially available hardware and a combination of commercially available and proprietary software components. 
 Our software applications, servers, and network infrastructure that deliver our services are hosted by a combination of third-party data center providers and HealthStream-owned data centers. We maintain fully redundant disaster recovery data centers which are located in geographically separate locations. Our technology equipment is maintained in secure, limited access environments, supported by redundant power, environmental conditioning, and network connectivity, and we follow industry best practices for backup and disaster recovery. Company personnel monitor all servers, networks, and systems on a continuous basis, and we employ enterprise firewall systems and data abstraction to protect our databases, customer information, and courseware library from unauthorized access. 
 COMPETITION 
 In addition to the competing healthcare education delivery methods in the industry, we also have direct competitors. In our Workforce Solutions business segment, a number of companies offer competitive learning management products and talent management modules to the healthcare industry. We compete with companies such as Cornerstone OnDemand, Healthcare Source, Oracle, SABA, SAP, Workday, and SumTotal Systems that provide their services to multiple industries, including healthcare. We also compete with large medical publishers that have operating units that offer learning management systems that focus on healthcare, such as Reed Elsevier Groups MC Strategies, Wolters Kluwer, and Relias Learning, which is owned by Bertelsmann. In our Provider Solutions business segment, we see competition primarily from several large companies, such as MD-Staff and Cactus from symplr. 
 We believe our Workforce Solutions, which include both products and services that facilitate training, assessment, and development for healthcare professionals, offer a wide assortment of courseware, include a mechanism for measuring satisfaction and/or other results, and provide all our services on a single platform over the Internet, provide us with a competitive advantage. In our Provider Solutions business segment, we believe the scope and quality of our products, capability to connect medical staff credentialing with provider enrollment, and innovative new predictive analytics provide us with a competitive advantage. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the marketing of our Workforce and Provider Solutions to the healthcare industry include:

 We believe these capabilities provide us with the ability to improve the quality of healthcare by assessing and developing the people who deliver care. 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY 
 Regulation of the Internet and the Privacy and Security of Personal Information 
 The laws and regulations that govern our business may change rapidly. The following are some of the evolving areas of law that are relevant to our business: 

● | Privacy and Security Laws. Federal, state, and foreign privacy and security laws and regulations restricting the collection, use, security, and disclosure of personal information limit our ability to collect information or use and disclose the information in our databases or derived from other sources to generate revenues. It may be costly to implement security or other measures designed to comply with new legislation or changes to existing laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Content Regulation. Both foreign and domestic governments have adopted and proposed laws governing the content of material transmitted over the Internet. These include laws relating to obscenity, indecency, libel and defamation. We could be liable if content created or delivered by us is determined to be in violation of these regulations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Information Security Accountability Regulation. As a business associate of certain of our customers, we are required to report certain breaches of protected health information to our customers, which must in turn notify affected individuals, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and, in certain situations involving large breaches, the media. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured, protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. In addition, we are subject to certain state laws that relate to privacy or the reporting of security breaches. For example, California law requires notification of security breaches involving personal information and medical information. We may incur costs to comply with these privacy and security requirements. Because there is little guidance related to many of these laws, it is difficult to estimate the cost of our compliance with these laws. Further, Congress has considered bills that would require companies to engage independent third parties to audit the companies computer information security. If the Company is required to report a breach of security or if one of the Companys customers is required to report a breach of security by the Company, the Companys business could be negatively impacted.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sales and Use Tax. Through December 31, 2017, we collected sales, use or other taxes on taxable transactions in states in which we have employees or have a significant level of sales activity. While HealthStream expects that this approach is appropriate, other states or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose tax collection obligations on companies like us that engage in online commerce. If they do, these obligations could limit the growth of electronic commerce in general and limit our ability to realize profit from the sale of our services over the Internet.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Laws and regulations directly applicable to content regulation, e-commerce, Internet communications, and the privacy and security of personal information are becoming more prevalent. Congress continues considering laws regarding Internet taxation. The dynamic nature of this regulatory environment increases the uncertainty regarding the marketplace impact of such regulation. The enactment of any additional laws or regulations may increase our cost of conducting business or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and operating results.

Regulation of Education, Training and Other Services for Healthcare Professionals 
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration. OSHA regulations require employers to provide training to employees to minimize the risk of injury from various potential workplace hazards. Employers in the healthcare industry are required to provide training with respect to various topics, including blood borne pathogens exposure control, laboratory safety and tuberculosis infection control. OSHA regulations require employers to keep records of their employees completion of training with respect to these workplace hazards. 
 The Joint Commission. The Joint Commission accreditation and certification standards require employers in the healthcare industry to provide certain workplace safety and patient interaction training to employees. Training required by The Joint Commission may include programs on infection control, patient bill of rights, radiation safety, and incident reporting. Healthcare organizations are required to provide and document training on these topics to receive accreditation from The Joint Commission. In addition, The Joint Commission imposes continuing education requirements on physicians that relate to each physicians specific staff appointments. 
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). HIPAA regulations require certain organizations (known as covered entities), including most healthcare providers and health plans, to adopt safeguards regarding the use and disclosure of health-related information. HIPAA regulations also require these organizations to provide reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy, integrity and confidentiality of individually identifiable healthcare information. Covered entities are required to establish, maintain and provide training with regard to their policies and procedures for protecting the integrity and confidentiality of individually identifiable healthcare information and must document training on these topics to support their compliance. Certain HIPAA privacy and security requirements apply to entities (known as business associates) that handle individually identifiable healthcare information on behalf of covered entities or other business associates. Covered entities, business associates and their subcontractors may be directly subject to criminal and civil sanctions for violations of HIPAA privacy and security standards. 
 The American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC). ANCC, a subsidiary of the American Nurses Association (ANA), provides individuals and organizations throughout the nursing profession with the resources they need to achieve practice excellence. ANCCs internationally renowned credentialing programs certify nurses in specialty practice areas; recognize healthcare organizations for promoting safe, positive work environments through the Magnet Recognition Program® and the Pathway to Excellence® Program; and accredit providers of continuing nursing education. In addition, ANCCs Institute for Credentialing Innovation® offers an array of informational and educational services and products to support its core credentialing programs. ANCC certification exams validate nurses skills, knowledge, and abilities. More than a quarter million nurses have been certified by ANCC since 1990. More than 80,000 advanced practice nurses are currently certified by ANCC. The ANCC Magnet Recognition Program® recognizes healthcare organizations that provide the very best in nursing care and professionalism in nursing practice. The program also provides a vehicle for disseminating best practices and strategies among nursing systems. The ANCC Magnet Recognition Program is a highly regarded standard for nursing excellence. The Pathway to Excellence® Program recognizes the essential elements of a high standard nursing practice environment. The designation is earned by healthcare organizations that create work environments where nurses can develop professionally. The award substantiates the professional satisfaction of nurses and identifies best places to work. 
 Continuing Nursing Education (CNE). State nurse practice laws typically authorize a states board of nursing to establish CNE requirements for professional nurses. The state board of nursing establishes the states CNE requirements for professional nurses. CNE credits are provided through accredited providers that have been approved by the ANCC Commission on Accreditation and/or the state board of nursing. We are an accredited provider of CNE by the ANCC.CNE requirements vary widely from state to state. Thirty-four states require registered nurses to certify that they have accumulated a minimum number of CNE credits in order to maintain their licenses. In some states, the CNE requirement only applies to re-licensure of advance practice nurses, or additional CNEs may be required of this category of nurses. Required CNE ranges from 12 to 45 credits annually, with reporting generally on a bi-annual basis. Board certifications (e.g., Certified Nurse Operating Room (CNOR)  certification of perioperative nursing) also require CNE credits, with certain percentages required in specific categories based on the certification type. 
 Continuing Medical Education (CME). State licensing boards, professional organizations and employers require physicians to certify that they have accumulated a minimum number of CME hours to maintain their licenses. Generally, each states medical practice laws authorize the states board of medicine to establish and track CME requirements. Forty-eight state medical licensing boards currently have CME requirements, as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The number of CME hours required by each state ranges from 15 to 50 hours per year. Other sources of CME requirements are state medical societies and practice specialty boards. The failure to obtain the requisite amount and type of CME could result in non-renewal of the physicians license to practice medicine and/or membership in a medical or practice specialty society. American Medical Association (AMA) classifies CME activities as either Category 1, which includes formal CME activities, or Category 2, which include self-designated credit for informal activities that meet certain requirements. CME providers that sponsor educational activities can only designate those activities for AMA PRA Category 1 Credit. Most agencies nationwide that require CME participation specify AMA PRA Category 1 Credit. Only institutions and organizations accredited to provide CME can designate an activity for AMA PRA Category 1 Credit. The Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) is responsible for awarding accreditation status to state medical societies, medical schools, and other institutions and organizations that provide CME activities for a national audience of physicians. State medical societies, operating under the aegis of the ACCME, accredit institutions and organizations that provide CME activities primarily for physicians within the state or bordering states. We are recognized in many states as an accredited provider of CME by the ACCME.

Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS has articulated three broad aims of its quality strategy: Better Care. Healthier People, Healthier Communities. Smarter Spending. To achieve this vision, CMS is committed to care that is safe, effective, timely, patient-centered, efficient, and equitable. Value-based purchasing (VBP), which links payment more directly to the quality of care provided, is a strategy that can help to transform the current payment system by rewarding providers for delivering high quality, efficient clinical care. Through a number of public reporting programs, demonstration projects, pilot programs, and other initiatives, some voluntary and some mandatory, CMS has launched VBP initiatives in hospitals, physician offices, nursing homes, home health services, and dialysis facilities. In 2017, CMS launched a comprehensive deregulatory initiative, Meaningful Measures, which identifies priorities for quality measurement and improvement. The framework is intended to improve patient outcomes while also reducing burdens on providers. 
 Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records (EHR) Incentive Programs. The Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs encourage eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) to adopt EHR technology. Eligible hospitals can receive Medicaid incentive payments if they adopt and demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology; those that fail to demonstrate meaningful use are subject to reduced reimbursement from Medicare. By putting into action and meaningfully using an EHR system, providers may reap benefits beyond financial incentivessuch as reduction in errors, availability of records and data, reminders and alerts, clinical decision support, and e-prescribing/refill automation. 
 Allied Disciplines. Various allied health professionals are required to obtain continuing education to maintain their licenses. For example, emergency medical services personnel may be required to acquire up to 20 continuing education hours per year, all or a portion of which can be fulfilled online. These requirements vary by state and depend on the professional classification of the individual. 
 Other Continuing Education. We are also an accredited provider of continuing education and continuing pharmacy education by the Association of Surgical Technologists, Inc. (AST) and the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), respectively. 
Regulation of Educational Program Sponsorship and Support 
 There are a variety of laws and regulations that affect the relationships between our medical device and pharmaceutical customers and the users of our products and services, including the sponsorship and support of educational programs. For example, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act (Sunshine Act) requires manufacturers of drugs, biological devices and medical devices covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Childrens Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS payments and other transfers of value, including educational programs, given by such manufacturers to physicians and teaching hospitals, with limited exceptions. CMS regulations require manufacturers to report the physicians name, business address and national provider identifier as well as other information including the value, date, form and nature of what is offered. CMS publishes the information on its website. Manufacturers that do not meet the reporting obligations are subject to significant monetary penalties. 
 Further, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) has issued Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and for the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supply Industry (collectively, the Guidelines). The Guidelines address compliance risks raised by the support of continuing educational activities by pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The Guidelines have affected and may continue to affect the type and extent of commercial support we receive for our continuing education activities. The trade associations for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries (PhRMA and AdvaMed, respectively) have also promulgated their own codes of ethics that further restrict the interactions between industry and health care professionals. In addition, the AMA has established its own code of ethics regarding Gifts to Physicians from Industry to provide standards of conduct for the medical profession. The Company follows the rules and guidelines provided by ACCME, ANCC, and other continuing education accrediting bodies to ensure that its continuing education programming is free from commercial bias and consistent with the Guidelines. 
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
 Current FDA and FTC rules and enforcement actions and regulatory policies or those that the FDA or the FTC may develop in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide existing or future applications or services to our end users or obtain the necessary corporate sponsorship to do so. The FDA and the FTC regulate the form, content and dissemination of labeling, advertising and promotional materials, including direct-to-consumer prescription drug and medical device advertising, prepared by, or for, pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device companies. The FTC regulates over-the-counter drug advertising and, in some cases, medical device advertising. Generally, regulated companies must limit their advertising and promotional materials to discussions of the FDA-approved indications. Therefore, any truthful or untruthful information that promotes the use of pharmaceutical or medical device products that is presented with our services is subject to the FDA and FTC requirements and regulatory oversight including criminal, civil and administrative actions. We believe that banner advertisements, sponsorship links and any educational programs that lack independent editorial control that we may present with our services could be subject to FDA or FTC regulation. While the FDA and the FTC place the principal burden of compliance with advertising and promotional regulations on the advertiser, if the FDA or FTC finds that any regulated information presented with our services violates FDA or FTC regulations, they may take regulatory action against us or the advertiser or sponsor of that information. In addition, the FDA may adopt new regulatory policies that more tightly regulate the format and content of promotional information on the Internet. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS 
 To protect our proprietary rights, we rely generally on copyright, trademark and trade secret laws; confidentiality agreements and procedures with employees, consultants and other third parties; contractual provisions in license agreements with consultants, vendors

 and customers; and use measures designed to control access to our software, documentation and other proprietary information. We own federal trademark and service mark registrations for several marks, including without limitation EXCELLENCE THROUGH INSIGHT, HEALTHSTREAM, HOSPITAL DIRECT, OR PROTOCOL, PATIENT INSIGHTS, PHYSICIAN INSIGHTS, INSIGHTS ONLINE, INSIGHT INTO ACTION, QUALITY CHECK, SIMCENTER, SIMMANAGER, and SIMSTORE. We also have obtained registration of the HEALTHSTREAM mark in certain other countries. Applications for several trademarks are currently pending. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining registration of other trademarks for which we have applied. 
 The courseware that we license to our customers is developed through a combination of license agreements with publishers and authors, assignments and work-for-hire arrangements with third parties, and development by employees. We require publishers, authors and other third parties to represent and warrant that their content does not infringe on or misappropriate any third-party intellectual property rights and that they have the right to provide their content and have obtained all third-party consents necessary to do so. Our publishers, authors and other third parties also agree to indemnify us against certain liability we might sustain due to the content they provide. 
 If a third party asserts a claim that we have infringed its patents or other intellectual property right, we may be required to redesign our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, we license technologies from third parties for incorporation into our services. Royalty and licensing agreements with these third parties may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Additionally, despite the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our efforts may not be adequate. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property, and such violations of our intellectual property are difficult to detect and police. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our products or services. If we fail to protect our proprietary rights adequately, our competitors could offer similar services, potentially significantly harming our competitive position and decreasing our revenues. 
 We hold inbound licenses for certain intellectual property that is used internally, and in some cases, utilized in HealthStreams products or services. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our operations and products and services are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with any third party.
