Company Overview
We are a global provider of network access solutions and communications equipment for service provider and enterprise networks. We research, develop, test, sell, manufacture and support communications equipment in five major areas: broadband access, Ethernet switching, mobile backhaul, passive optical LAN (POLAN) and software defined networks (SDN).
1

We research, develop and test products and technologies for our customers to purchase and deploy in their networks. We have development and test capabilities in five countries around the world. We are a global company with over 1,000 customers in more than 50 countries worldwide. We use a combination of both in-house and outsourced manufacturing of our products. 
Broadband Access
Our broadband access products are at the core of our product strategy and offer a variety of options for carriers and service providers to connect residential and business customers. Our solutions allow carriers and service providers to either use high-speed fiber or leverage their existing deployed copper networks to offer broadband services to customer premises. Once our broadband access products are deployed, the service provider can offer voice, high-definition and ultra-high-definition video, high-speed internet access and business class services to their customers. We develop our broadband access products for all aspects of carrier and service provider access networks: customer premise equipment (such as digital subscriber line (DSL) modems), Ethernet access demarcation devices, Gigabit passive optical network (GPON) terminals, 10 Gigabit (10G) passive optical network (XGPON1/XGSPON/NGPON2) terminals and, Gigabit (GE) and 10G point-to-point Active Ethernet optical network terminals (ONTs). We also develop central office products, such as broadband loop carriers for DSL and voice-grade telephone service (POTS), high-speed digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAMs) with G.fast and very-high-bit-rate DSL (VDSL) capabilities, optical line terminals (OLTs) for passive optical distribution networks like GPONs, 10G passive optical networks and 10G point-to-point Active Ethernet. 
Ethernet Switching
Our Ethernet switching products provide a high-performance and manageable solution that bridges the gap from carrier access technologies to the core network. Over the past ten years carriers have migrated access infrastructure to Ethernet from time-division multiplexing and asynchronous transfer mode systems. Our products can also be deployed in data centers, blurring the line between central office and data center. Our products support pure Ethernet switching as well as layer 3 IP and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) and are currently being developed for deployment as part of SDNs. 
Mobile Backhaul
Our mobile backhaul products provide a robust, manageable and scalable solution for mobile operators that enable them to upgrade their mobile backhaul systems and migrate from 3G networks to LTE and beyond. We provide our mobile backhaul products to mobile operators or carriers who provide the transport for mobile operators. Our mobile backhaul products may be collocated at the radio access node (RAN) base station (BS) and can aggregate multiple RAN BS in to a single backhaul for delivery of mobile traffic to the RAN network controller. We provide standard Ethernet/IP or MPLS interfaces and interoperate with other vendors in these networks. With mobile backhaul networks providing carriers with significant revenue growth in recent years, mobile backhaul has become one of the most important parts of their networks. 
Passive Optical LAN
Our FiberLAN portfolio of POLAN products are designed for enterprise, campus, hospitality and entertainment arena usage. Our FiberLAN portfolio includes our high-performance, high-bandwidth GPON OLTs connected to the industry’s most diverse ONT product line, which include units with integrated Power over Ethernet (PoE) to power a wide range of PoE-enabled access devices. Our environmentally friendly FiberLAN POLAN solutions are one of the most cost-effective LAN technologies that can be deployed, allowing network managers to deploy a future-proof, low-maintenance, manageable solution that requires less space, air conditioning, copper and electricity than other alternatives. 
Software Defined Networks
Our SDN and network function virtualization (NFV) strategy is to develop tools and building blocks that will allow service providers to migrate their networks’ full complement of legacy control plane and data plane devices to a centralized intelligent controller that can reconfigure the services of hundreds of network elements in real time for more controlled and efficient provision of bandwidth and latency across the network. The migration to SDN and NFV will provide better service for end customers and a more efficient and cost-effective use of hardware resources for service providers. We will leverage our broadband access, mobile backhaul and Ethernet switching expertise to extract and virtualize many of the traditional legacy control and data plane functions to allow them to be run from the Cloud. The latest evolution of our hardware-based solution was designed to support SDN and NFV.

Industry Background
We believe growth in our business in the coming years will be driven by continued growth in worldwide demand for network access solutions and communications equipment that enable or support access to high-speed broadband services. The communications industry continues to experience rapid expansion with the internet and proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications and services leading to increasing demands for high-bandwidth communications networks. The broad adoption of new technologies such as smartphones, digital video cameras and high definition and ultra high definition televisions allow music, pictures, user-generated content (as found on the many video-sharing sites) and high definition video to be a growing part of consumers’ regular exchange of information. In recent years, the growth of social communications and social networking has continued to place demands on existing access infrastructure and new consumer demands are challenging even the newest and most advanced infrastructures. All of these new technologies share a common dependency on high-bandwidth communication networks and sophisticated traffic management tools. However, network service providers have struggled to meet the increased demand for high-speed broadband access due to the cost of network infrastructure upgrades. As bandwidth demands continue to increase, carriers need to continue to upgrade their network infrastructure to support such demand. The infrastructure upgrade cycle typically has the effect of moving bandwidth bottlenecks from one part of the network to another (such as a carrier’s access network, core network or datacenters), depending on technology selection and cost.
It is widely believed that a fiber-optic connection that runs from customers’ premises all the way to the carrier’s datacenters is the best network architecture for a fixed network. This network architecture is called Fiber to the Premises (FTTP). However, FTTP is also typically the most expensive network solution, due to the associated build-out and equipment cost. Although many carriers have, to different degrees, adopted FTTP as their primary network architecture, many limit their use of FTTP to new greenfield builds and rely on hybrid fiber-copper topologies in their existing network in order to reduce cost. For example, popular and less costly alternatives to FTTP include Fiber to the Curb (FTTC) or Fiber to the Node (FTTN) network architecture. In these architectures, the carrier lays a fiber-optic cable to a street cabinet and then uses DSLAMs or Multiple Service Access Node (MSAN) to provide higher speed services to their customers over copper wire. Another trend in network access is the shift away from the legacy telephone switches (used in carrier networks from the 1980’s to the early 2000’s): many carriers that continue to provide services over copper wire are decommissioning their legacy telephone switches and moving services over to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) platforms on an MSAN. Our broadband access products and solutions are designed to address these market trends by allowing carriers and service providers to either use fiber-optic networks or leverage their existing deployed copper networks to offer broadband services to customer premises.
With respect to mobile wireless networks, the popularity of mobile smartphones and increasing demand for mobile data has forced mobile network operators to upgrade their mobile access technologies from 3rd generation wireless (3G) to 4th generation wireless (4G or LTE) and to plan for 5th generation wireless technologies (5G). These technology upgrades are typically accompanied by network infrastructure upgrades, including upgrades to the carriers’ access networks (referred to as mobile backhaul), core networks and datacenters. Our mobile backhaul products provide a robust, manageable and scalable solution for mobile network operators that enable them to upgrade their mobile backhaul systems and migrate from 3G networks to LTE and beyond.
Another growing industry trend is the desire of carriers and service providers to simplify network operation and reduce costs. Increasingly, we see network operators seeking to reduce the number of active components in their networks and to centralize network data and control in datacenters, both of which require network redesigns and upgrades. Our FiberLAN portfolio of POLAN products, as well as our Ethernet switching products and SDN and NFV tools and building blocks, are designed to address these market trends, with POLAN emerging as a popular customer choice for network upgrades.
The DZS Strategy
Our business strategy is to be a leading global provider of network access solutions and communications equipment. The principal elements of our strategy include:

• | Leverage Growth Opportunities from the Merger. We believe the expanded geographic reach of the combined company and the enhanced functionality and range of our product offerings following the Merger represent attractive opportunities for growth in our business. Prior to the Merger, DNS provided communications equipment primarily in the Asia-Pacific region with a particular focus on Korea, Japan and Vietnam, and Legacy Zhone provided communications equipment primarily in the Americas and EMEA region. DNS and Legacy Zhone had complementary product portfolios prior to the Merger, with both DNS and Legacy Zhone offering broadband access solutions and related products. We intend to continue to leverage the combination of DNS and Legacy Zhone products to enhance the functionality and range of our product offerings and create increased sales opportunities worldwide. 


• | Drive Cost Efficiencies through Integration of DNS and Legacy Zhone Operations. We intend to continue to drive cost efficiencies in our business through continuing efforts to integrate the DNS and Legacy Zhone global operations, 

3

with a view to creating a single efficient global engineering and support organization to support all customers of the combined company worldwide. We also expect to drive further cost efficiencies through product cost reductions and manufacturing economies of scale resulting from the Merger.

• | Maintain Focus on Technology Leadership. We believe that our future success is built upon our investment in the development of advanced communications technologies. We intend to continue to focus on research and development to maintain our leadership position in network access solutions and communications equipment.

Customers
For our core business, we sell our products and services to carriers and service providers that offer voice, data and video services to businesses, governments, utilities and residential consumers. Our global customer base includes regional, national and international carriers and service providers. To date, our products have been deployed by over 1,000 carriers and service providers worldwide. 
For our FiberLAN business, we sell our POLAN solutions directly and through system integrators and distributors to hospitality, education, stadiums, manufacturing and business enterprises as well as to the government and military. Our global FiberLAN customer base includes hotels, universities, sports arenas, military bases, government institutions, manufacturing facilities and Fortune 500 businesses. 
For the year ended December 31, 2017 no customer represented 10% or more of net revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, three customers, SK Broadband, Inc., DNI (a related party) and LG Uplus Corp., represented 16%, 14% (a related party) and 10% of net revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, four customers, KT Corporation, LG Uplus Corp., DNI (a related party) and SK Broadband, Inc. represented 26%, 21%, 17% (a related party) and 10% of net revenue, respectively. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of net revenue during these periods.
Research and Development
The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, and continuing developments in communications service offerings. Our continuing ability to adapt to these changes, and to develop new and enhanced products, is a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. Therefore, we continue to make significant investments in product development.
We have research and product development facilities at our headquarters in Oakland, California, as well as core research and product development centers in Seminole, Florida, Alpharetta Georgia, South Korea, Vietnam and India. In all of these centers we develop and test both our hardware and software solutions. We continue to invest heavily in automated and scale testing capabilities for our products to better emulate our customers’ networks.
Our product development activities focus on products to support both existing and emerging technologies in the segments of the communications industry that we consider represent viable revenue opportunities. We are actively engaged in continuing to refine our solution architecture, introducing new products using the various solutions we support, and in creating additional interfaces and protocols for both domestic and international markets.
We continue our commitment to invest in leading edge technology research and development. Our research and product development expenses were $35.4 million, $25.4 million, and $21.3 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We plan to continue to support the development of new products and features, while seeking to carefully manage associated costs through expense controls.
Intellectual Property
We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance, however, that these rights can be successfully enforced against competitive products in every jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.
Many of our products are designed to include intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there 
4

can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
The communications industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us, or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
Sales and Marketing
We have a sales presence in various domestic and foreign locations, and we sell our products and services both directly and indirectly through channel partners with support from our sales force. Channel partners include distributors, resellers, system integrators and service providers. These partners sell directly to end customers and often provide additional value add services such as system installation, technical support, and professional support services in addition to the equipment sale. Our sales efforts are generally organized according to geographical regions:

• | U.S. Sales. Our U.S. Sales organization establishes and maintains direct and indirect relationships with domestic customers, which include carriers and service providers, cable operators utilities and enterprises. In addition, this organization is responsible for managing our distribution channel.


• | International Sales. Our International Sales organization targets foreign carriers, service providers, enterprise customers and is staffed with individuals with specific experience dealing with carriers, service providers and channel partners, in their designated international territories.

Our marketing team works closely with our sales, research and product development organizations, and our customers by providing communications that keep the market current on our products and features. Marketing also identifies and sizes new target markets for our products, creates awareness of our company and products, generates contacts and leads within these targeted markets and performs outbound education and public relations.
Backlog
Our backlog consists of purchase orders for products and services that we expect to ship or perform within the next year. Our backlog may fluctuate based on the timing of when purchase orders are received. At December 31, 2017, our backlog was $24.4 million, compared to $28.8 million at December 31, 2016. We consider backlog to be an indicator, but not the sole predictor, of future sales because our customers may cancel or defer orders without penalty.
Competition
We compete in communications equipment markets, providing products and services for the delivery of voice, data and video services. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to solutions that offer superior advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in our core business, including Nokia, Calix, Adtran, Huawei, and ZTE, among others. In our FiberLAN business, our competitors include Tellabs and Cisco, among others. In our Ethernet switching business, our competitors include Brocade, Juniper, and Cisco, among others. In addition, a number of companies have introduced products that address the same network needs that our products and solutions address, both domestically and abroad. The overall number of our competitors may increase, and the identity and composition of competitors may change. As we continue to expand our sales globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include:

• | product performance;


• | interoperability with existing products;


• | scalability and upgradeability;


• | conformance to standards;


• | breadth of services;

5


• | reliability;


• | ease of installation and use;


• | geographic footprints for products;


• | ability to provide customer financing;


• | pricing;


• | technical support and customer service; and


• | brand recognition.

While we believe that we compete successfully with respect to each of these factors, we expect to face intense competition in our markets. In addition, the inherent nature of communications networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies.
Manufacturing
We manufacture our products using a strategic combination of procurement from qualified suppliers, in-house manufacturing at our facility in Florida, and the use of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) located in the Far East. We manufacture many of our more complex products at our manufacturing facility in Florida.
Our parts and components are procured from a variety of qualified suppliers in the U.S., the Far East, Mexico and other countries around the world per our approved supplier list and detailed engineering specifications. Some completed products are procured to our specifications and shipped directly to our customers. We also acquire completed products from certain suppliers and configure and ship from our facility. Some of these purchases are significant. We purchase both standard off-the-shelf parts and components, which are generally available from more than one supplier, and single-source parts and components. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies to meet customer demand in a timely manner from our current vendors, or, when necessary, from alternate vendors. We believe that alternate vendors can be identified if current vendors are unable to fulfill our needs, or design changes can be made to employ alternate parts.
We design, specify, and monitor all of the tests that are required to meet our quality standards. Our manufacturing and test engineers work closely with our design engineers to ensure manufacturability and testability of our products, and to ensure that manufacturing and testing processes evolve as our technologies evolve. Our manufacturing engineers specify, build, or procure our test stations, establish quality standards and protocols, and develop comprehensive test procedures and processes to assure the reliability and quality of our products. Products that are procured complete or partially complete are inspected, tested, or audited for quality control.
Our Quality Management System is compliant with ISO-9001:2015 and we are certified to ISO-9001:2015 by our external registrar, National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI). ISO-9001:2015 requires that our processes are documented, followed and continuously improved. Internal audits are conducted on a regular schedule by our quality assurance personnel, and external audits are conducted by our external registrar each year. Our quality system is based upon our model for quality assurance in production and service to ensure our products meet rigorous quality standards.
We believe that we have sufficient production capacity to meet current and future demand for our product offerings through a combination of existing and added capacity, additional employees, or the outsourcing of products or components.
Compliance with Regulatory and Industry Standards
Our products must comply with a significant number of voice and data regulations and standards which vary by jurisdiction. Standards for new services continue to evolve, and we may need to modify our products or develop new versions to meet these standards. Standards setting and compliance verification in the U.S. are determined by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, Underwriters Laboratories, Quality Management Institute, Telcordia Technologies, Inc., and other communications companies. In international markets, our products must comply with standards issued by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and other standards bodies, as implemented and enforced by the regulatory authorities in the applicable jurisdiction.
6

Environmental Matters
Our operations and manufacturing processes are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to the use, handling, storage, discharge and disposal of certain hazardous materials and wastes, the pre-treatment and discharge of process waste waters and the control of process air pollutants. We believe that our operations and manufacturing processes currently comply in all material respects with applicable environmental protection laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of our products. In addition, such regulations could require us to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the redesign of any non-compliant product. From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. For example, in 2003 the European Union enacted the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (RoHS) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE), for implementation in European Union member states. We are aware of similar legislation that is currently in force or is being considered in the United States, as well as other countries, such as Japan and China. Additionally, we are aware of and are taking suitable action to comply with new European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances standards (RoHS2) in advance of the 2019 compliance deadline. Our failure to comply with any of such regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being liable for costs, fines, penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in countries in the jurisdictions where these regulations apply.
Audit Committee Investigation
On March 21, 2017, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors concluded, in consultation with management and after informing our former independent registered public accounting firm, that Legacy Zhone's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in its Amendment No. 2 to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 should no longer be relied upon due to material errors associated with the sale and subsequent return of certain products sold in December 2014. In connection with such finding, the Audit Committee commenced an independent investigation to determine whether any financial statements of Legacy Zhone prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016 contained material errors. As a result of this investigation, which concluded in late July 2017, the Audit Committee concluded, in consultation with management and after informing our former independent registered public accounting firm, that Legacy Zhone's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and March 31, 2016 and Legacy Zhone's audited consolidated financial statements and assessments of internal control over financial reporting, including disclosure controls and procedures, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 contained in its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 should no longer be relied upon. The determination that there were errors in Legacy Zhone's financial statements in periods prior to the Merger does not impact the financial statements of DZS following the Merger given the treatment of DNS as accounting acquirer.
Matters relating to or arising from the Audit Committee investigation and the associated material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting, including adverse publicity, have caused us to incur significant legal, accounting and other professional fees and other costs, have exposed us to greater risks associated with other civil litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions, have diverted resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy and may have impacted our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and vendors.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 629 individuals worldwide. We consider the relationships with our employees to be positive. Competition for technical personnel in our industry is intense. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel. To date, we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future.
Executive Officers
Set forth below is information concerning our executive officers and their ages as of December 31, 2017. As part of the management transition in connection with the first anniversary of the Merger, on September 11, 2017, James Norrod and Kirk Misaka stepped down from their roles as Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, and Il Yung Kim was appointed President, Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer.
