Overview 
 Zeta is a leading omnichannel data-driven cloud platform that provides enterprises with consumer intelligence and marketing automation software. We empower our customers to target, connect and engage consumers through software that delivers personalized marketing across all addressable channels, including email, social media, web, chat, Connected TV (“CTV”) and video, among others. We believe our actionable insights derived from consumer intent enable our customers to acquire, grow and retain consumer relationships more efficiently and effectively than the alternative solutions available in the market. 
 Our Zeta Marketing Platform, or ZMP, is the largest omnichannel marketing platform with identity data at its core. The ZMP can analyze billions of structured and unstructured data points to predict consumer intent by leveraging sophisticated machine learning algorithms and the industry’s largest opted-in data set for omnichannel marketing. The ZMP acts on these insights by connecting with consumers through native integration of marketing channels and API integration with third parties. The ZMP’s data-driven algorithms and processes learn and optimize each customer’s marketing program in real time, producing a ‘flywheel effect’ that enables our customers to test, learn and improve their marketing programs in real time. 
 The ZMP empowers our customers to personalize consumer experiences at scale across multiple touchpoints. Marketing programs are created and orchestrated by our customers through automated workflows and sophisticated dashboards. Our Consumer Data Platform (“CDP+”) ingests, analyzes and distills disparate data points to generate a single view of a consumer, encompassing identity, profile characteristics, behaviors and purchase intent, which is then made accessible through a single console. Our Opportunity Explorer synthesizes Zeta’s proprietary data and data generated by our customers to uncover consumer insights that are translated into marketing programs designed for highly targeted audiences across digital channels, including email, SMS, websites, applications, social media, CTV and chat. 
 We designed the ZMP using a flexible, service-oriented architecture in order to facilitate rapid development of new solutions, to meet evolving industry demands and to support new use cases and marketing requirements. The ZMP is hosted in the Zeta Hybrid Cloud, which is a unique pairing of a public cloud (AWS/Google) deployment and self-hosted private cloud (VMware/Docker/Kubernetes) resources designed to facilitate workload management in a cost-effective, performant and efficient manner. 
 We have also dedicated significant resources to the goal of building customer trust by developing and implementing programs designed to protect data privacy and to promote a secure technical environment. The resources we dedicated to this goal include engineers, analysts, lawyers, policy experts and operations specialists, as well as hardware and software from leading vendors and solutions we have designed and built. In particular, we have implemented a number of technical innovations, process enhancements and industry solutions in response to our increased obligations with respect to our data. For example, we can identify and implement user consent parameters and opt-in or opt-out as applicable and can evaluate whether such consents apply to our various data sources, products or customers. 
 The ZMP is built on the following four pillars: 
 1.    Opted-in Data Set 
 Our data set is an amalgamation of our private proprietary data, publicly available data and data provided by our partner ecosystem. 
 
1 

  Our data set contains more than 225 million opted-in individuals in the U.S. and more than 535 million opted-in individuals globally with an average of more than 2,500 demographic and behavioral attributes per individual. On average, we ingest more than 1 trillion content consumption signals per month on a global basis and synthesize this information into hundreds of intent-based audiences, which can then be used to create marketing programs. All this data is managed through a proprietary database structure that has patented flexibility, speed and scalability. 
2.    Patented AI Engine 
 We believe our proprietary data is key to our AI engine. We analyze this data through extensive application of AI technologies, including machine learning and natural language processing. We leverage our AI technologies and data within the ZMP to: 

• | Seamlessly collect and ingest structured and unstructured data into the ZMP;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quickly and reliably analyze key consumer attributes and signals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identify consumer intent by running sophisticated algorithms to analyze data;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cluster related concepts and prioritize actionable insights to create intent-based graphs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Create audiences comprised of individuals or affinity-driven clusters scored based on intent;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Personalize content to make experiences more relevant for the consumer and profitable for the enterprises; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Create channel and content recommendations to optimize marketing performance.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.    Omnichannel Engagement 
 Our platform provides integrated access to a wide range of omnichannel inventory and data sources, as well as third-party services and platforms. The ZMP integrates these third-party sources and services to enable our customers to deploy their targeted marketing programs through a wider range of channels, devices and formats, all within a single platform. This enables our customers to improve how they identify and engage the modern consumer who is using multiple devices and platforms (e.g., mobile, website, applications, social media, CTV and email). 
4.    Performance Optimization 
 Zeta’s platform provides real-time results to our customers through a graphical dashboard and makes recommendations for improvement through the same graphical interface. Our AI engineers continuously update the machine learning algorithms to improve the overall ROI for our customers. 
Our Products 
 Our product suites are powered by the ZMP and are designed to enable enterprises to acquire, grow and retain consumer relationships more efficiently and effectively than alternative solutions available in the market. Our customers can purchase our products individually or in combination to obtain a 360-degree view of the consumer and our products can scale based on the needs of the customer. We also offer various technical upgrades, consulting services, additional integrations and access to ad-hoc data sources, services or channels. As a result, our customers are incentivized to allocate an increasing percentage of their marketing budgets to our platform and to enter into long-term contractual commitments with us.

  Opportunity Explorer 
 As our keystone product suite, the Opportunity Explorer detects and surfaces new marketing opportunities for our customers to achieve their business goals. Based on our proprietary data and uniquely modeled intender scores, the Opportunity Explorer can present immediate and actionable opportunities within the ZMP that our customers can then use to generate growth. A closed-loop cycle from insight to activation ensures that our AI engine can quickly learn from the available data, identify the best data signals and create accurate and up-to-date Zeta Identity Graphs™. The Opportunity Explorer is woven into the fabric of the ZMP and is accessible through five product modules: MarketPulse, CustomerPulse, DMAPulse, AudiencePulse and CompetitorPulse. 
 

• | MarketPulse provides marketers with real-time notifications and longitudinal visualizations representing changes in consumer sentiment and interest.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CustomerPulse provides marketers with real-time, actionable insights across acquisition, retention and growth opportunities derived by enriching a customer’s data with Zeta data.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | DMAPulse provides marketers with real-time, actionable insights on designated market areas that should receive increased or decreased investments to optimize market share and customer acquisition efficiency.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AudiencePulse provides marketers with real-time, actionable insights on more than 900 Zeta audiences predicting consumer intent and interest.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CompetitorPulse providers marketers with actionable insights on the business’s competitive set and opportunities to capture market share and prevent customer attrition.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our customers can use all five of the modules or choose any individual module to obtain data-cloud based insights on their existing consumers and prospects. We offer Opportunity Explorer for a licensing fee and / or an incremental fee based on customers’ utilization of the ZMP. The terms of our subscription agreements are typically quarterly or annual. 
 CDP+ 
 As part of our platform, customers can use the CDP+ as their system of record for all consumer information. The CDP+ delivers a single, actionable view of customers and prospects that include real-time identifiers and attributes. Customers can consolidate multiple databases and internal and external data feeds and organize their data based on their unique needs and performance metrics. Enriched with intent-based scoring from Zeta’s Data Cloud, CDP+ makes it possible to identify anonymous website visitors and engage them across channels with meaningful, individualized experiences. The CDP+ has extensive technical flexibility and can adjust to our customers’ custom data schemas with limited or no pre-configuration required. If necessary, we can also engineer a deeper level of data integration between the CDP+ and our customers’ marketing infrastructure. As part of our standard offering, we provide our customers with service-level agreements (“SLAs”) that guarantee high-levels of reliability, performance and security. Customers pay Zeta a design and development fee and a licensing fee for the CDP+. The terms of our subscription agreements are typically annual or multi-year. 
Our Growth Strategies 
 Our data and AI-powered platform enables our customers to transform their digital marketing strategy, accelerate their revenue growth and enhance business returns. In turn, our customers’ success motivates them to increase their use of our platform, thereby accelerating our revenue and growth. Key elements of our long-term growth strategy include: 
 Further penetrate our existing customer base. We have customers spanning a wide spectrum of industry verticals and we believe we can achieve significant organic growth by cross-selling our existing

  solutions, making full use of our data capabilities and insights and by capturing increased share of our scaled customers’ marketing spend by introducing new features and functionalities within the ZMP. 
 Acquire new scaled customers. We intend to aggressively pursue new scaled customers by investing in our sales and customer service teams while driving increased efficiencies in our go-to-market approach. The Opportunity Explorer also serves as a sales accelerator to help acquire and grow new customers. We also have extensive relationships with many marketing agencies and enterprises and believe we can extend our platform to provide B2B marketing capabilities. 
 Continue to innovate and develop new products. With over 500 data scientists and engineers, we believe we are well positioned to quickly develop new products and take full advantage of the shift to digital marketing. Since we view data as one of our key competitive advantages, we will also continue to invest resources to expand our data offerings, both from third-party providers, as well as our proprietary data sources. 
 Expand into international markets. As we expand relationships with our existing customers in the U.S., we are also investing in select regions in Europe. In addition, we believe that Asia may represent a substantial growth opportunity and we are in the early stages of developing our business plan with respect to these markets. 
 Continue to strengthen our partnership ecosystem and expand sales capacity. With a focus on growing our sales capacity, we are building a sophisticated sales operation to focus on opportunity creation and progression. We believe these new capabilities will allow us to further strengthen our relationships with our existing customers and gain global market share. 
 Our Key Strengths 
 Zeta’s competitive strengths historically have included the following: 
 Omnichannel Engagement 
 Through the ZMP, our customers are able to identify and target consumers across a wide range of digital channels. These channels can work independently, in parallel or in concert depending on the marketing strategies and tactics of our customers. Many of these channels, such as email and programmatic, are native to the ZMP, while others, such as social media, are accessed through API integrations with companies, such as Facebook and Snap. 
Actionable Insights 
 Our customers can use the Opportunity Explorer module in the ZMP to obtain and take action on high-value consumer insights in real-time. The ZMP monitors, aggregates and synthesizes the behaviors of individuals globally across multiple points of interactions to predict interest and intent. 
Recognized Leader in Marketing Automation 
 We believe our customers choose our platform over others because of its powerful, integrated and easy to use applications, rapid integration with various channels and technologies, and seamless onboarding of our customers’ and third-party data. We have been recognized by various third-party research reports as a leader in the marketing automation sector such as in 2020, when we were recognized as a “Leader” by The Forrester Wave™: Email Marketing Service Providers, Q2 2020 and received the highest possible scores for our campaign management data, analytics, artificial intelligence and campaign operations capabilities.

  Secure, Scalable and Reliable Platform 
 The ZMP has been designed to provide our customers with high levels of reliability, data integrity, performance and security. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost-effectively to tens of thousands of customers and millions of users. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously. Our architecture also enables us to segment access privileges across our user base. 
Our Customers 
 We work with some of the largest and most well-known enterprises across a wide spectrum of industry verticals including insurance, consumer & retail, telecommunications and financial services, which contributed 12%, 13%, 12% and 12% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 14%, 11%, 11% and 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. Over 96% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was derived from scaled customers, which we define as customers from which we have generated trailing-12-month revenue of at least $100,000. We had 1,035 and 1,081 total customers and 355 and 336 scaled customers as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Competition 
 The markets for our products are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, disruptive technology developments, frequent product introductions, short product life cycles, price cutting with resulting downward pressure on gross margins and price sensitivity on the part of customers. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and better integrate our existing products, introduce new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, meet changing customer needs, provide best-in-class data security to maintain customer confidence and combat cyber-attacks, extend our core technology into new applications and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological changes. 
 We believe no single company has offerings that match the comprehensive capabilities of the ZMP and CDP+, but we face collective competition from a variety of companies. Our competitive market is highly fragmented with most competitors focused on specific use cases, end markets and/or types of data sets and point solutions. We believe the principal factors that drive competition between vendors in our market include: 
 

• | Quality of insights and analytics;
--+-----------------------------------


• | Omnichannel automation;
--+------------------------


• | Real-time scoring and decisioning of data sets;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Utility of data management tools;
--+----------------------------------


• | Comprehensive systems integration;
--+-----------------------------------


• | Ease and speed of data ingestion and data onboarding; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Scale and scope of identity and audience data.
--+-----------------------------------------------


We believe we compete favorably across these factors. In particular, we believe the ZMP’s competitive advantages include: 
 

• | Intuitiveness and ease of use;
--+-------------------------------


• | Comprehensive feature set;
--+---------------------------

For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our industry is intensely competitive, and if we do not effectively compete against current and future competitors, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed” and “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Data Collection and Security, Intellectual Property and Technology Industry Regulations— Our intellectual property rights may be difficult to enforce and protect, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our technology without compensating us, thereby eroding our competitive advantages and having an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.” 
 Seasonality 
 In general, the marketing industry experiences seasonal trends that affect the vast majority of participants in the digital marketing ecosystem. Historically, marketing activity is higher in the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with the holiday shopping season as compared to the first quarter. As a result, the subsequent first quarter tends to reflect lower activity levels and lower performance. We generally expect these seasonality trends to continue and our ability to effectively manage our resources in anticipation of these trends may affect our operating results. 
Data Privacy & Security Laws 
 Contemporary consumers use multiple platforms to learn about and purchase products, and have come to expect a seamless experience across all channels. This challenges marketing organizations to balance the demands of the consumer for a seamless experience with privacy-compliant methods of managing data and using such data to create these experiences. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we are or may become subject to numerous state, federal and foreign laws, requirements and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of data. In the U.S., both Congress and state legislatures, along with federal regulatory authorities, have continued to increase their attention on the collection and use of consumer data, including as it relates to internet-based marketing. California has enacted broad-based privacy legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as supplemented by the subsequent California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which comes into force in 2023. State legislatures outside of California have proposed dozens of data privacy bills similar to, but distinct from, the CCPA/CPRA, and new laws have been adopted in Colorado and Virginia which also come into force in 2023. We anticipate that, as with the CCPA/CPRA, new laws in the U.S. at either the state or federal level will generally allow personal information collection by businesses as the default, so long as data use practices are made transparent to consumers and consumer rights are honored when requested (opt-out model), with the exception of select classes of “sensitive data.” To date, despite significant legislative activity around privacy in the states and at the federal level, there have been no significant or credible efforts at legislation that would require prior consent before data is used (opt-in model), apart from sensitive data. Zeta believes that a continued emphasis on an opt-out regime in the U.S. will mean a continued ability to collect and use non-sensitive personal data at scale for marketing purposes. 
 Outside the U.S., the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) (and the UK equivalent, the United Kingdom GDPR (“UK GDPR”)) remain in force in Europe, and, overlaid with country-level laws 
 
6 

  implementing the ePrivacy Directive, continues to raise questions about the application of these laws to third-party marketing technology companies such as Zeta. Many non-U.S., non-EU jurisdictions have also enacted or are developing laws and regulations governing the collection and use of personal data, including Brazil, Canada, Japan, Singapore, India, South Africa and others. These laws represent a spectrum of opt-in vs. opt-out models, with the GDPR establishing the most stringent set of requirements for obtaining consumer consent. These requirements have served as barriers to the expansion of Zeta’s business in these markets; Zeta has created compliant solutions, but has not been able in some cases to achieve sufficient scale of data collection to create compelling business cases for customers in these markets. 
 Human Capital 
 We believe that our employees love working at Zeta because they believe that they are working towards a larger mission. We pride ourselves in hiring the best global talent with employees across the U.S. (including New York and Silicon Valley), the EU and India. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,434 employees, including 787 employees located outside of the U.S. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations or work stoppages due to labor disagreements. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 Zeta is devoted to and invested in living our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, which we know drives more collaboration, innovation, and better outcomes for teams and individuals. Representation at Zeta, and ensuring an inclusive workplace where all feel like they belong and can bring their true selves at work, is at the core of our “Zeta Unity” DEI strategy. We strive to empower all talent to excel as unique individuals, while also providing a forum to connect for everyone to learn from one another and celebrate our differences. 
 Zeta Unity is focused on ensuring equity across all backgrounds at Zeta by creating awareness of different cultures through global panel discussions, volunteering and mentoring opportunities, cultural programming, as well as providing various trainings to all employees. We also actively deploy new processes to increase diversity through talent acquisition and community outreach. 
 We currently have five Employee Resource Communities (ERCs) with strong engagement and participation: Bridge Builders (Black Community), WING (Women’s Community), PRIDE (LGBTQIA+ community), LiT (Latinx Community) and MOSIAC (AAPI Community). Each ERC also welcomes allies as we believe that creating meaningful change can only be achieved by working collectively as a team. We also offer an internal mentorship program to connect leaders with members of the ERCs. 
 Compensation, Benefits, and Employee Wellness: 
 We aim to provide market-competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees. To recruit and retain the best talent in a highly competitive marketplace, we routinely examine and refresh our compensation packages that may include salary, bonuses, sales commissions and equity. We believe by offering our full-time employees equity under our incentive award plan and providing an employee stock purchase plan, we can build a strong feeling of ownership and commitment to our shared long-term success. 
 In addition to our commitment to providing market-competitive compensation packages, we continue to look for ways to enhance our total rewards programs. Our full-time employees are offered medical, dental and vision insurance and life and disability insurance plans. These plans are designed to provide a comprehensive benefits package that is flexible and allows employees to maximize benefits based on individual needs. Furthermore, we provide the following programs, which vary by country/region: generous paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules, and 401(k) matching.

  COVID-19 Response 
 To continue to support the well-being of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have created new resources for our employees to assist with the transition to a remote work environment. We have maintained an engaged and productive workforce without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our team members safe. 
Intellectual Property 
 We have a patent portfolio of more than 100 U.S. and international patents and applications which include 12 granted patents and 23 pending patent applications covering artificial intelligence, automation for predictive personalization and consumer identity resolution. Our key patents also include secure data encryption technology enabling us to leverage our CDP+ to enhance our customers’ proprietary data while maintaining separation between the data sets. We also currently own trademark registrations and applications for the ZETA and DISQUS names and variants thereof and other product-related marks in the United States and certain foreign countries. We have also registered numerous internet domain names related to our business. We also rely on copyright laws to protect computer programs related to our platform and our proprietary technologies. In addition, we enter into confidentiality agreements and invention or work product assignment agreements with employees and contractors involved in the development of our proprietary intellectual property. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
