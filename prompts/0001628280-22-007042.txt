ITEM 1. BUSINESS
FAT Brands Inc. is a leading multi-brand restaurant company that develops, markets, acquires and manages quick service, fast casual, casual dining and polished casual dining restaurant concepts around the world. We operate primarily as a franchisor of restaurants, where we generally do not own or operate the restaurant locations but rather generate revenue by charging franchisees an initial franchise fee as well as ongoing royalties. This “asset light” franchisor model provides us with the opportunity for strong profit margins and an attractive free cash flow profile while minimizing restaurant operating company risk, such as long-term real estate commitments or capital investments. For some of our brands, we also directly own and operate restaurant locations, in addition to franchising restaurants. 
Our scalable management platform enables us to add new stores and restaurant concepts to our portfolio with minimal incremental corporate overhead cost, while taking advantage of significant corporate overhead synergies. The acquisition of additional brands and restaurant concepts as well as expansion of our existing brands are key elements of our growth strategy. In addition to our restaurant operations, we also own and operate a manufacturing and production facility in Atlanta, Georgia, which supplies our franchisees with cookie dough, pretzel dry mix and other ancillary products. 
As of December 26, 2021, our franchisee base consisted of 761 franchisees, who operated an aggregate of 2,240 restaurants, including restaurants under construction. We also directly owned and operated an additional 129 restaurants as of such date. System wide sales of our franchised and owned locations during fiscal 2021 were approximately $1.1 billion, which includes sales during the period in which we owned the brands that we acquired during fiscal 2021. 
The FAT Brands Difference – Fresh. Authentic. Tasty.
Our name represents the values that we embrace as a company and the food that we provide to customers – Fresh. Authentic. Tasty (which we refer to as “FAT”). The success of our franchisor model is tied to consistent delivery by our restaurant operators of freshly prepared, made-to-order food that our customers desire. With the input of our customers and franchisees, we continually strive to keep a fresh perspective on our brands by enhancing our existing menu offerings and introducing appealing new menu items. When enhancing our offerings, we ensure that any changes are consistent with the core identity and attributes of our brands, although we do not intend to adapt our brands to be all things to all people. In conjunction with our restaurant operators (which means the individuals who manage and/or own our franchised restaurants), we are committed to delivering authentic, consistent brand experiences that have strong brand identity with customers. Ultimately, we understand that we are only as good as the last meal served, and we are dedicated to having our franchisees consistently deliver tasty, high-quality food and positive guest experiences in their restaurants.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths include:
•Management Team Designed to Support Multiple Brands and Categories. As our business has expanded to 17 brands, we have developed a robust and comprehensive management and systems platform designed to support the expansion of our existing brands while enabling for the accretive and efficient acquisition and integration of additional restaurant concepts. We have distinct teams of managers focused on four main categories – Quick Service, Fast Casual, Casual Dining and Polished Casual Dining. Our platform is scalable and adaptable, allowing us to incorporate growth in existing brands and new concepts into the FAT Brands family with minimal incremental corporate costs.
•Strong Brands Aligned with FAT Brands Vision. We have an enviable track record of delivering Fresh, Authentic, and Tasty meals across our franchise system, with leading brands in four categories. Our Fatburger, 
Table of Contents

Round Table Pizza, Twin Peaks, Johnny Rockets, Fazoli's and Buffalo’s concepts have built distinctive brand identities within their respective categories, providing made-to-order, high-quality food at competitive prices. The Ponderosa and Bonanza brands deliver an authentic American steakhouse experience. Hurricane Grill & Wings and Native Grill & Wings offer customers fresh chicken wings with an assortment of sauces and rubs in a casual dining atmosphere. Yalla Mediterranean offers a healthful Mediterranean menu of wraps, plates, and bowls in a fast-casual setting. Elevation Burger was the first organic burger chain, serving premium grass-fed beef patties and heart-healthy olive oil fries in a family and eco-friendly environment. Maintaining alignment with the FAT Brands vision across an expanding platform, we believe that our concepts appeal to a broad base of domestic and global consumers.
•Ability to Cross-Sell Multiple Brands from the FAT Brands Portfolio. Our ability to easily and efficiently cross-sell to our existing franchisees new brands from our portfolio affords us the ability to grow more quickly and satisfy our existing franchisees’ demands to expand their operations. By having the ability to offer our franchisees a variety of restaurant concepts in multiple categories, our existing franchisees are able to acquire the rights to a well-rounded portfolio of FAT Brands concept offerings to strategically satisfy their respective market demands where opportunities are available. We have developed a pipeline of more than 800 restaurants under development driven in part by our diverse and attractive portfolio of brands.
•Asset Light Business Model Driving High Free Cash Flow Conversion. We operate primarily as a franchisor of restaurants, where we generally do not own or operate the restaurant locations but rather generate revenue by charging franchisees an initial franchise fee as well as ongoing royalties based on their sales. This "asset light" franchisor model provides us with the opportunity for strong profit margins and an attractive free cash flow profile while minimizing restaurant operating company risks, such as long-term real estate commitments, capital investments and increases in employee wage costs. For some of our brands, we also directly own and operate restaurant locations.
•Robust Franchisee Support. Our franchisees are our primary customers and we dedicate considerable resources and industry knowledge to promote their success. We offer our franchisees multiple support services such as public relations, supply chain assistance, site selection analysis, staff training and operational oversight and support. We develop and produce most marketing initiatives for our brands in-house, including advertising campaigns, product placements and social media / digital marketing. We have developed a diverse and loyal base of more than 750 franchisees with restaurants located in 40 countries including 48 states within the United States, without any excessive market concentration among the franchisees. 
Our Growth Strategy
The principal elements of our growth strategy include:
•Organically Grow New Store Pipeline and Attract New Franchisees. We have developed a pipeline of more than 800 restaurants under development among our existing and newly acquired franchisees. We also believe that the worldwide markets for our brands are far from saturated and can support a significant increase in units through new franchisee relationships. In many cases, prospective franchisees have experience in and knowledge of markets where we are not currently active, facilitating a smoother brand introduction than we or our existing franchisees could achieve independently. 
•Acquire New Brands that Enhance Existing Categories. Our management platform was designed and developed to cost-effectively and seamlessly scale with new restaurant concept acquisitions, particularly those in our existing restaurant categories. We have identified additional categories of potential acquisitions that appeal to a broad base of U.S. and international customers and that would be accretive to our existing portfolio of brands, including restaurants focused on salads, sandwiches, health and organic foods, coffee and dessert outlets and sports bars.

•Accelerate Same-Store Sales Growth. Same-store sales growth reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable store base, which we define as the number of stores open for at least one full fiscal year. To optimize restaurant performance, we have embraced a multi-faceted same-store sales growth strategy. We utilize customer feedback and closely analyze sales data to introduce, test and improve existing and add new menu items. In addition, we regularly utilize public relations and experiential marketing, which we leverage via social media and targeted digital advertising to expand the reach of our brands and to drive traffic to our stores. Furthermore, we have embraced emerging technology and worked with the "Olo" platform to develop our own brand-specific mobile applications, allowing guests to find restaurants, order online, earn rewards and join our e-marketing providers. We have also

partnered with third-party delivery service providers, including UberEATS, Grub Hub, DoorDash and Postmates, which provide online and app-based delivery services and constitute a sales channel for our existing locations. Finally, many of our franchisees are pursuing a capital expenditure program to remodel legacy restaurants and to opportunistically co-brand them with our concepts.
•Driving Store Growth Through Co-Branding, Virtual Restaurants and Cloud Kitchens. We franchise co-branded Fatburger / Buffalo’s Express locations, giving franchisees the flexibility of offering multiple concepts, while sharing kitchen space, resulting in a higher average check (compared to stand-alone Fatburger locations). Franchisees benefit by serving a broader customer base, and we estimate that co-branding results in a 20%-30% increase in average unit volume compared to stand-alone locations with minimal incremental cost to franchisees. Our acquisition strategy reinforces the importance of co-branding, as we expect to offer each of the complementary brands that we acquire to our existing franchisees on a co-branded basis.
•Optimize Capital Structure. In 2021, we funded our acquisition of restaurant brands primarily through the issuances of notes under four separate whole-business securitization facilities, which significantly reduced our net cost of capital compared with acquisitions that we consummated in prior years. In the future, we plan to refinance these notes and may seek an investment rating on a portion of the notes in order to further reduce our cost of capital.
•Continue Expanding FAT Brands Internationally. We have a significant global presence, with international franchised stores in 39 countries including 48 states within the United States. We believe that the appeal of our Fresh, Authentic, and Tasty concepts is global, and we are targeting further penetration of Middle Eastern and Asian markets, particularly through expanding and number of units of several of our existing brands.
Franchise Program
General. We utilize a franchise development strategy as our primary method for new store growth by leveraging the interest of our existing franchisees and those potential franchisees with an entrepreneurial spirit looking to launch their own business. We have a franchisee qualification and selection process to ensure that each franchisee meets our strict brand standards.
Franchise Agreements. Our current franchise agreements generally provide for an initial franchise fee ranging from $0 to $50,000 per store, and a royalty fee of between 0.75% and 7% of net sales. In addition, franchisees typically pay an advertising fee based on net sales for local marketing and brand marketing. 
Development Agreements. For some of our brands, we use development agreements to facilitate the planned expansion of our restaurants through single and multiple unit development. Each development agreement gives a developer the exclusive right to construct, own and operate stores within a defined area. In exchange, the franchisee agrees to open a minimum number of stores in the area in a prescribed time period. Franchisees that enter into development agreements are required to pay a fee, which is credited against franchise fees due when the store is opened in the future. Franchisees may forfeit such fees and lose their rights to future development if they do not maintain the required store opening schedule.
Franchisee Support
Marketing
Our Fresh, Authentic and Tasty values are the anchor that inspires our marketing efforts. Our resolve to maintain our premium positioning, derived from the FAT Brands’ values, is reinforced by our management platform, capital light business model, experienced and diverse global franchisee network and seasoned and passionate management team. Although our marketing and advertising programs are concept-specific, we believe that our restaurant customers appreciate the value of their experiences visiting our establishments and, thus, the core of our marketing strategy is to engage and dialogue with customers at our restaurant locations as well as through social media.
Our Fresh, Authentic and Tasty values are an invitation for restaurant customers to align with FAT Brands’ commitment to consistently deliver freshly prepared, made-to-order food that restaurant customers desire. We are dedicated to keeping a fresh perspective on our concepts, perfecting our existing menu offerings as well as introducing appealing new items. We ensure that any changes are consistent with the core identity of our brands, and we will not adapt our brands to be all things to all people.
Our marketing initiatives include a robust mix of local community marketing, in-store campaigns, product placements, partnerships, promotions, social media, influencer marketing, traditional media and word of mouth advertising. Corresponding 
Table of Contents

with the evolutionary shift in how restaurant customers receive content and engage with media and brands today, we have also dramatically increased our focus on mobile, social, and digital advertising to leverage the content we generate from public relations and experiential marketing to better connect with restaurant customers, sharing information about new menu offerings, promotions, new store openings and other relevant FAT Brands information. We communicate with restaurant customers in creative and organic ways that we believe fortifies our connections with them and increase brand awareness.
Site Selection and Development
Our franchisees work alongside our franchise development department during the search, review, leasing and development process for a new restaurant location. Typically, it takes between 60 and 90 days from the time we sign an agreement with a franchisee until that franchisee signs a lease. When selecting a location, our team assists franchisees in seeking locations based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to traffic patterns, access, visibility, building constraints, competition, activity generators and lease terms.
Supply Chain Assistance
FAT Brands is committed to seeking out and working with best-in-class suppliers and distribution networks on behalf of our franchisees. Our Fresh, Authentic and Tasty vision guides us in how we source and develop our ingredients, always looking for the best ways to provide top quality food that is as competitively priced as possible for our franchisees and their customers. We utilize a third-party purchasing and consulting company that provides distribution, rebate collection, product negotiations, audits and sourcing services focusing on negotiating distributor, vendor and manufacturer contracts, thereby ensuring that our brands receive meaningful buying power for our franchisees.
Our team has developed a reliable supply chain and continues to focus on identifying additional back-ups to avoid or minimize any possible interruption of service and product globally for our franchisees. Domestically, FAT Brands has distribution agreements with broadline national distributors as well as regional providers. Internationally, our franchisees have distribution agreements with different providers market-by-market. We utilize distribution centers operated by our distributors. Our broadline national distributors are the main purchasing link in the United States among many of our suppliers, and distribute most of our dry, refrigerated and frozen goods, non-alcoholic beverages, paper goods and cleaning supplies. Internationally, distributors are also used to provide the majority of products to our franchisees.
Food Safety and Quality Assurance. Food safety is one of our top priorities of FAT Brands. As such, we maintain rigorous safety standards for our menu offerings. We have carefully selected preferred suppliers that adhere to our safety standards, and our franchisees are required to source their ingredients from these approved suppliers. Furthermore, our commitment to food safety is strengthened through the direct relationship between our Supply Chain and Field Consultant Assistance teams.
Management Information Systems. FAT Brands restaurants utilize a variety of back-office, computerized and manual, point-of-sale systems and tools. We utilize these systems following a multi-faceted approach to monitor restaurants operational performance, food safety, quality control, customer feedback and profitability.
The point-of-sale systems are designed specifically for the restaurant industry and we use many customized features to evaluate operational performance, provide data analysis, marketing promotional tracking, guest and table management, high-speed credit card and gift card processing, daily transaction data, daily sales information, product mix, average transaction size, order modes, revenue centers and other key business intelligence data. Utilizing these point-of-sale systems back-end, web-based, enterprise level, software solution dashboards, our home office and Franchise Operations Consultant Support staff are provided with real-time access to detailed business data which allows for our home office and Franchise Operations Consultant Support staff to closely, and remotely, monitor stores performance and assist in providing focused and timely support to our franchisees. Furthermore, these systems supply sales, bank deposit and variance data to our accounting department on a daily basis, and we use this data to generate daily sales information and weekly consolidated reports regarding sales and other key measures for each restaurant with final reports following the end of each period. We have an integration of our newly acquired brands in process and expect to be fully integrated by the end of fiscal 2022.
In addition to utilizing these point-of-sale systems, FAT Brands utilizes systems which provide detailed, real-time (and historical) operational data for all locations, allowing our management team to track product inventories, equipment temperatures, repair and maintenance schedules, intra-shift team communications, consistency in following standard operating procedures and tracking of tasks. FAT Brands also utilizes a web-based employee scheduling software program providing franchisees, and their management teams, increased flexibility and awareness of scheduling needs allowing them to efficiently, and appropriately, manage their labor costs and store staffing requirements/needs. Lastly, FAT Brands utilizes a proprietary

customer feedback system allowing customers to provide feedback in real-time to our entire management team, franchisees and store managers.
Field Consultant Assistance
In conjunction with utilizing the FAT Brands Management Information Systems, FAT Brands has a team of dedicated Franchise Operations Consultant Support staff who oversee designated market areas and specific subsets of restaurants. Our Franchise Operations Consultant Support staff work in the field daily with franchisees, and their management teams, to ensure that the integrity of all FAT Brands concepts are upheld and that franchisees are utilizing the tools and systems FAT Brands requires in order to provide input to our franchisees to assist them to optimize and accelerate their profitability.

Once open, FAT Brands constantly provides ongoing operational and marketing support to our franchisees with the intention of offering advice to their management teams that they can use if they choose to more effectively operate their restaurants and increasing their stores financial profitability.
Competition
Our franchised and company owned restaurants compete in the quick service, fast casual, casual and polished casual dining categories of the restaurant industry, a highly competitive industry in terms of price, service, location, and food quality. The restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer trends, economic conditions, demographics, traffic patterns, and concern about the nutritional content of fast casual foods. Furthermore, there are many well-established competitors with substantially greater financial resources than the Company's, including several national, international, regional and local store franchisors and operators. The restaurant industry also has few barriers to entry and new competitors may emerge at any time.
Seasonality
While some of our brands are subject to seasonal fluctuations in their sales and may be affected by the effects of inclement weather, our business overall does not experience significant seasonal variability in its financial performance.
Intellectual Property
We own, domestically and internationally, valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other proprietary information related to our restaurant and corporate brands. This intellectual property includes logos and trademarks which are of material importance to our business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. We seek to actively protect and defend our intellectual property from infringement and misuse.
Employees
We believe our employees are critical to our success and seek to provide a working environment which encourages personal growth and success. We offer competitive compensation benefits customary to our industry. Our benefits package for qualified employees includes employer paid health insurance and opportunities for stock-based incentives  Our restaurant employees receive continuing training and have the opportunity to advance in responsibility and leadership. We believe communication is key to the effectiveness of our workforce and schedule regular teleconference sessions, updating our employees on the direction of the business and key milestones to be achieved.

Table of Contents

December 26, 2021, we had approximately 5,200 employees, including approximately 1,100 full time employees. This amount includes approximately 830 full time and 4,000 part time employees at restaurants which we own and operate. We have a diverse workforce and believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Government Regulation
U.S. Operations. Our U.S. operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business, primarily laws and regulations concerning the franchisor/franchisee relationship, marketing, food labeling, sanitation and safety and anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Each of our franchised and company owned restaurants in the U.S. must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, sanitation, safety, fire and zoning agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located. To date, we have not been materially adversely affected by such licensing and regulation or by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.
International Operations. Our restaurants outside the U.S. are subject to national and local laws and regulations which in general are similar to those affecting U.S. restaurants.
