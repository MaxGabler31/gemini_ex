ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
GENERAL
Gartner, Inc. (NYSE: IT) is the world’s leading research and advisory company and a member of the S&P 500. We equip business leaders with indispensable insights, advice and tools to achieve their goals and build the successful organizations of tomorrow. We believe we have an unmatched combination of expert-led, practitioner-sourced and data-driven research that steers clients toward the right decisions on the issues that matter most. We’re trusted as an objective resource and critical partner by more than 12,000 organizations in more than 100 countries — across all major functions, in every industry and enterprise size.
Gartner delivers its products and services globally through four business segments: Research, Consulting, Events, and Talent Assessment & Other: 

• | Research provides trusted, objective insights and advice on the mission-critical priorities of leaders across all functional areas of the enterprise through research and other reports, briefings, proprietary tools, access to our analysts, peer networking services and membership programs that enable our clients to make better decisions. Gartner's traditional strengths in IT, marketing and supply chain research were enhanced in 2017 with Gartner's acquisition of CEB, Inc. ("CEB"), which added CEB's best practice and talent management research insights across a range of business functions, to include human resources, sales, legal and finance.


• | Consulting provides customized solutions to unique client needs through on-site, day-to-day support, as well as proprietary tools for measuring and improving IT performance with a focus on cost, performance, efficiency and quality.


• | Events provides business professionals across the organization the opportunity to learn, share and network. From our flagship CIO event Gartner Symposium/ITxpo, to industry-leading conferences focused on specific business roles and topics, to member-driven sessions, our events enable attendees to experience the best of Gartner insight and advice live.


• | Talent Assessment & Other helps organizations assess, engage, manage and improve talent. This is accomplished through knowledge and skills assessments, training programs, workshops, and survey and questionnaire services.

MARKET OVERVIEW 
We are living and working in the midst of a revolution. Technology increasingly drives organizational strategies rather than just supporting them, and three megaforces - technology-driven industry disruption, the growing pervasiveness of technology across every part of the enterprise, and sustained macroeconomic and political volatility (such as commodity price swings, exchange rate flux, Brexit) - are rapidly changing how businesses and other organizations plan and operate. 
To remain viable and competitive, business leaders must deal with this unprecedented level of disruption and change. No enterprise can be operationally effective unless it incorporates the right technology into every part of its business. This means considering technology from many angles - how it affects all business levels, functions and roles. Chief Financial Officers, Heads of Human Resources, Chief Marketing Officers and other executives and leaders across the enterprise are more reliant on technology than ever. Given this critical need, business enterprises, governments and their agencies, and other organizations turn to Gartner for decision-making guidance to ensure they maximize their technology investments and meet their current and future needs. 
Our legacy of expertise in IT has given way to a new position: Strategic research and advisory services operating across the entire organization. We believe our best-in-class Gartner content combined with CEB expertise in functional areas has strengthened our value proposition and increased our market opportunity to an all-time high.
OUR SOLUTION
We believe our unmatched combination of expert-led, practitioner-sourced, data-driven research steers clients toward the right decisions on the issues that matter most. We employ a diversified business model that utilizes and leverages the breadth and depth of our intellectual capital. The foundation of our business model is our ability to create and distribute our proprietary research

content as broadly as possible via published reports, interactive tools, facilitated peer networking, briefings, consulting and advisory services, and our events, including the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo series.
We had over 1,900 research analysts as of December 31, 2017 located around the world who create compelling, relevant, independent and objective research and fact-based analysis on virtually every function across the enterprise. Through our robust product portfolio, our global research team provides thought leadership and insights that CIOs and other technology practitioners, HR, sales, legal, and finance executives, and supply chain and marketing professionals need to make the right decisions, every day.
In addition to our research analysts, as of December 31, 2017 we had 669 experienced consultants who combine our objective, independent research with a practical business perspective focused on the IT industry. Finally, our events are the largest of their kind, gathering together highly qualified audiences that include CIOs and other IT and C-suite executives, frontline IT architects and professionals, purchasers and providers of technology and supply chain products and services, business professionals, and other leaders across marketing, finance, legal, sales and HR.
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and sources of value for our clients that facilitate increased client spending on our research, consulting services and events. A critical part of our long-term strategy is to increase business volume and penetration with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and advice. We also seek to extend the Gartner brand name to develop new client relationships, augment our sales capacity and expand into new markets around the world. In addition, we seek to increase our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective pricing of our products and services. These initiatives have created additional revenue streams through more effective packaging, campaigning and cross-selling of our products and services.
Our principal products and services are delivered through our four business segments: 

• | RESEARCH. Gartner delivers independent, objective advice to leaders across the enterprise, primarily through a subscription-based digital media service. Gartner research is the fundamental building block for all Gartner services. We combine our proprietary research methodologies with extensive industry and academic relationships to create Gartner solutions that address each role.

Our research agenda is defined by clients’ needs, focusing on the critical issues, opportunities and challenges they face every day. We are in steady contact with over 12,000 distinct organizations worldwide. We publish tens of thousands of pages of original research annually, and our analysts answer over 380,000 client inquiries every year. Our size and scale allow us to commit vast resources toward broader and deeper analyst coverage, and to deliver insight to our clients based on what they need and where they are. The ongoing interaction between our research analysts and our clients enables us to identify the most pertinent topics to them and develop relevant product enhancements to meet the evolving needs of users of our research. Our proprietary research content, presented in the form of reports, briefings, updates and related tools, is delivered directly to the client’s desktop via our website and/or product-specific portals.
Clients normally sign subscription contracts that provide access to our research content for individual users over a defined period of time. We typically have a minimum contract period of 12 months for our research subscription contracts, and as of December 31, 2017, more than half of our contracts are multi-year.

• | CONSULTING. Gartner Consulting deepens relationships with our largest research clients by extending the reach of our research through custom consulting engagements. Gartner Consulting brings together our unique research insight, benchmarking data, problem-solving methodologies and hands-on experience to improve the return on a client’s IT investment. Our consultants provide fact-based consulting services to help clients use and manage IT to optimize business performance.

Consulting solutions capitalize on Gartner assets that are invaluable to IT decision making, including: (1) our extensive research, which ensures that our consulting analyses and advice are based on a deep understanding of the IT environment and the business of IT; (2) our market independence, which keeps our consultants focused on our clients' success; and (3) our market-leading benchmarking capabilities, which provide relevant comparisons and best practices to assess and improve performance. Gartner Consulting provides solutions to CIOs and other IT executives, and to those professionals responsible for IT applications, enterprise architecture, go-to-market strategies, infrastructure and operations, program and portfolio management, and sourcing and vendor relationships. Consulting also provides targeted consulting services to professionals in specific industries. Finally, we provide actionable solutions for IT cost optimization, technology modernization and IT sourcing optimization initiatives.

• | EVENTS. Gartner attracts more than 75,000 technology and business professionals and 1,100 industry-leading technology providers to its 75+ conferences worldwide each year. Attendees experience sessions led by Gartner analysts, cutting-edge technology solutions, peer exchange workshops, one-on-one analyst meetings, consulting diagnostic workshops, keynotes and more. They also provide attendees with an opportunity to interact with business executives from the world’s leading technology companies. In addition to role-specific summits and workshop-style seminars, Gartner holds its unique, flagship Symposium/ITxpo in eight locations worldwide annually. Since the addition of CEB, we’ve expanded to host 700+ more intimate live events each year plus 220+ exclusive CxO gatherings through the Evanta brand.


• | TALENT ASSESSMENT & OTHER. Our offerings help organizations plan, recruit, assess, develop, engage and drive performance of their organizational talent against corporate objectives. Our talent assessment and development solutions help companies manage human capital investments. These offerings include cognitive ability assessments, skills and/or knowledge assessments, personality questionnaires, and job/role simulations and are generally implemented as pre-hire or post-hire applications. We also evaluate training programs and develop and offer workshops and technical training that enhance the potential of emerging leaders and their teams. Our proprietary workshops and technical training provide an executive education curriculum supported by e-learning resources for members seeking to enhance skill development for their staff. These tools and services use science and data to develop talent strategies for clients that are linked to business results.

On February 6, 2018, we announced that we had reached a definitive agreement to sell our CEB Talent Assessment business, which is a significant portion of the Talent Assessment & Other segment. Note 2 — Acquisitions and Divestiture and Note 16 — Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information. 
COMPETITION
We believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are:

• | Superior research content - We believe that we create the broadest, highest-quality and most relevant research coverage across all major functional roles in the enterprise. Our research analysis generates unbiased insight that we believe is timely, thought-provoking and comprehensive, and that is known for its high quality, independence and objectivity.


• | Our leading brand name - We have provided critical, trusted insight under the Gartner name for over 35 years.


• | Our global footprint and established customer base - We have a global presence with clients in more than 100 countries on six continents. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside of the United States.


• | Experienced management team - Our management team is composed of research veterans and experienced industry executives with long tenure at Gartner.


• | Substantial operating leverage in our business model - We have the ability to distribute our intellectual property and expertise across multiple platforms, including research publications, consulting engagements, conferences and executive programs, to derive incremental revenue and profitability.


• | Vast network of analysts and consultants - As of December 31, 2017, we had over 1,900 research analysts and 669 experienced consultants located around the world. Our analysts collectively speak 59 languages and are located in 26 countries, enabling us to cover all aspects of technology and business on a global basis.

Notwithstanding these differentiating factors, we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services. We compete indirectly with consulting firms and other information providers, including electronic and print media companies. These indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the Internet. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services. While we believe the breadth and depth of our research positions us well versus our competition, increased competition could result in loss of market share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing, and increased sales and marketing expenditures.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. We have policies related to confidentiality, ownership, and the

use and protection of Gartner’s intellectual property. We also enter into agreements with our employees as appropriate that protect our intellectual property, and we enforce these agreements if necessary. We recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify, create and protect it. Additionally, we actively monitor and enforce contract compliance by
our end users. 
EMPLOYEES 

We had a total of 15,131 employees as of December 31, 2017, a significant increase compared to 8,813 at December 31, 2016. The increase consists of an 18% growth in heritage Gartner headcount as we continued to invest for future growth and the additional employees resulting from our acquisitions. 
We had 8,486 employees based in the U.S. at December 31, 2017: 1,335 employees were located at our headquarters facility in Stamford, Connecticut and nearby; 1,584 employees were located at our Ft. Myers, Florida offices; 1,657 were located in Arlington, Virginia; and 3,910 employees were located elsewhere in the United States in 56 other offices. We had 6,645 employees located outside of the United States in 106 offices at December 31, 2017: 1,046 employees were located in Egham, the United Kingdom; 883 employees were located in Gurgaon, India; and the remaining 4,716 employees were located in 104 other offices. 
Our employees may be subject to collective bargaining agreements at a company or industry level, or works councils, in those foreign countries where this is part of the local labor law or practice. We have experienced no work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be favorable.
