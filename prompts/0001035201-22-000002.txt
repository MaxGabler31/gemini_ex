Overview
California Water Service Group is a holding company with seven operating subsidiaries: California Water Service Company (Cal Water), New Mexico Water Service Company (New Mexico Water), Washington Water Service Company (Washington Water), Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. (Hawaii Water), TWSC, Inc. (Texas Water), and CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility Services LLC (CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility Services LLC being referred to collectively in this annual report as Utility Services). Cal Water, New Mexico Water, Washington Water, and Hawaii Water are regulated public utilities. Texas Water holds regulated and contracted wastewater utilities. 
The regulated utility entities also provide some non-regulated services. Utility Services holds non-utility property and provides non-regulated services to private companies and municipalities outside of California (see Non-Regulated Activities below for more details). Cal Water was the original operating company and began operations in 1926.
Our business is conducted through our operating subsidiaries and we provide utility services to approximately two million people. The bulk of the business consists of the production, purchase, storage, treatment, testing, distribution and sale of water for domestic, industrial, public and irrigation uses, and the provision of domestic and municipal fire protection services. In some areas, we provide wastewater collection and treatment services, including treatment which allows water recycling. We also provide non-regulated water-related services under agreements with municipalities and other private companies. The non-regulated services include full water system operation, billing and meter reading services. Non-regulated operations also include the lease of communication antenna sites, lab services and promotion of other non-regulated services.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no significant changes in the kind of products produced or services rendered by our operating subsidiaries, or in the markets or methods of distribution.

Regulated Business
California water operations are conducted by Cal Water, which provides service to approximately 494,500 customer connections in approximately 100 California communities through 21 separate districts, which are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). California water operations accounted for approximately 90.3% of our total customer connections and 91.9% of our total consolidated operating revenue. 
We operate the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce water systems under lease agreements. In accordance with the lease agreements, we receive all revenues from operating the systems and are responsible for paying the operating costs. The City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce lease revenues are governed through their respective city councils and are considered non-regulated because they are outside of the CPUC's jurisdiction. We report revenue and expenses for the City of 
Table of Contents

Hawthorne and City of Commerce leases in operating revenue and operating expenses because we are entitled to retain all customer billings and are responsible for all operating expenses. These leases are considered "nontariffed products and services" (NTPS) by the CPUC and require a 10% revenue sharing with regulated customers.
In October of 2011, an agreement was negotiated with the City of Hawthorne to lease and operate its water system. The system, which is located near the Hermosa Redondo district, serves about half of Hawthorne's population. The capital lease agreement required an up-front $8.1 million lease deposit to the city that is being amortized over the lease term. Additionally, annual lease payments will be adjusted based on changes in rates charged to customers. Under the lease, we are responsible for all aspects of system operation and capital improvements, although title to the system and system improvements reside with the city. Capital improvements are recorded as depreciable plant and equipment and depreciated per the asset lives set forth in the agreement. In exchange, we receive all revenue from the water system, which was $11.4 million, $10.5 million, and $9.5 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. At the end of the lease, the city is required to reimburse us for the unamortized value of capital improvements made during the term of the lease. The City of Hawthorne capital lease is a 15-year lease and expires in 2026.
In April of 2018, a renewal agreement was negotiated with the City of Commerce for us to continue to lease and to operate its water system for 15 years. Under the agreement, the operating lease requires us to pay $0.8 million per year in monthly installments. We have operated the City of Commerce water system since 1985 and are responsible for all operations, maintenance, water quality assurance, customer service programs, and financing capital improvements to provide a reliable supply of water that meets federal and state standards to customers served by the City of Commerce system. The City of Commerce retains title to the system and system improvements and remains responsible for setting its customers’ water rates. We bear the risks of operation and collection of amounts billed to customers. In exchange, we receive all revenue from the water system, which was $3.4 million, $2.9 million, and $2.9 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The agreement allows us to request a rate change annually in order to recover costs. 
Hawaii Water provides service to approximately 6,200 water and wastewater customer connections on the islands of Maui, Oahu, and Hawaii, including several large resorts and condominium complexes. Hawaii Water's regulated customer connections are subject to the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (HPUC). Hawaii Water accounts for 1.1% of our total customer connections and approximately 4.5% of our total consolidated operating revenue.
Washington Water provides domestic water service to approximately 36,400 customer connections in the Tacoma, Olympia, Graham, Spanaway, Puyallup, and Gig Harbor areas. Washington Water's utility operations are regulated by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission. Washington Water accounts for approximately 6.6% of our total customer connections and approximately 2.7% of our total consolidated operating revenue.
New Mexico Water provides service to approximately 8,600 water and wastewater customer connections in the Belen, Los Lunas, Indian Hills, and Elephant Butte areas in New Mexico. New Mexico's regulated operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission. New Mexico Water accounts for approximately 1.6% of our total customer connections and 0.6% of our total consolidated operating revenue.
In May of 2021, Texas Water became the majority owner of BVRT, a Texas-based utility development company owning and operating four wastewater utilities serving growing communities outside of Austin and San Antonio. Texas Water initially invested funds to enable BVRT to continue to build wastewater infrastructure and converted its investment to equity. BVRT’s five wastewater utilities currently serve or are under contract to serve over 1,900 customer connections, with an estimated potential total build-out of more than 61,000 connections. Texas Water accounts for approximately 0.4% of our total customer connections and 0.3% of our total consolidated operating revenue.
The state regulatory bodies governing our regulated operations are referred to as the Commissions in this annual report. Rates and operations for regulated customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the respective state's regulatory Commission. The Commissions require that water and wastewater rates for each regulated district are independently determined based on the cost of service. The Commissions are expected to authorize rates sufficient to recover normal operating expenses and allow the utility to earn a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.
We distribute and treat water and treat wastewater in accordance with accepted water utility methods. Where applicable, we hold franchises and permits in the cities and communities where we operate. The franchises and permits allow us to operate and maintain facilities in public streets and right-of-ways as necessary.
Non-Regulated Activities
Non-regulated revenue and expenses consist primarily of the operation of water systems that are owned by other entities under lease agreements, leasing of communication antenna sites on our properties, billing of optional third-party insurance programs to our residential customers, and unrealized gains or losses on benefit plan investments.
Table of Contents

Fees for non-regulated activities are based on contracts negotiated between the parties. Under our non-regulated contract arrangements, we operate municipally owned water systems and privately owned water and recycled water distribution systems, but are not responsible for all operating costs. Non-regulated revenue received from non-leased water system operations is generally determined on a fee-per-customer basis. 
In California, nearly all non-regulated activities are now considered NTPS. The prescribed accounting for these NTPS is incremental cost allocation plus revenue sharing with regulated customers. Non-regulated services determined to be "active activities" require a 10% revenue sharing, and "passive activities" require a 30% revenue sharing. The amount of non-regulated revenues subject to revenue sharing is the total billed revenues less any authorized pass-through costs. Some examples of CPUC authorized pass-through costs are purchased water, purchased power, and pump taxes. All of our non-regulated services, except for leasing communication antenna sites on our properties, are "active activities" subject to a 10% revenue sharing. Leasing communication antenna sites on our properties are "passive activities" subject to a 30% revenue sharing. Cal Water's annual revenue sharing with regulated customers was $3.1 million, $2.5 million, and $2.7 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 
Operating Segment
We operate in one reportable segment, the supply and distribution of water and providing water-related utility services. For information about revenue from external customers, net income attributable to California Water Service Group and total assets, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Growth
We intend to continue exploring opportunities to expand our regulated and non-regulated water and wastewater activities, particularly in the western United States. The opportunities could include system acquisitions, lease arrangements similar to the City of Hawthorne and City of Commerce contracts, utility development investments similar to the BVRT investment, full service system operation and maintenance agreements, meter reading, billing contracts and other utility-related services.

Rates and Regulation
The Commissions have plenary powers setting both rates and operating standards. As such, the Commissions' decisions significantly impact the Company's revenues, earnings, and cash flows. The amounts discussed herein are generally annual amounts, unless otherwise stated, and the financial impact to recorded revenue is expected to occur over a 12-month period from the effective date of the decision. In California, water utilities are required to make several different types of filings. Certain filings, such as General Rate Case (GRC) filings, escalation rate increase filings, and offset filings, may result in rate changes that generally remain in place until the next GRC. As explained below, surcharges and surcredits to recover balancing and memorandum accounts as well as GRC interim rate relief are temporary rate changes, having specific time frames for recovery.
The CPUC follows a rate case plan which requires Cal Water to file a GRC for each of its regulated operating districts (except Grand Oaks) every three years. In a GRC proceeding the CPUC not only considers the utility's rate setting requests, but may also consider other issues that affect the utility's rates and operations. The CPUC is generally required to issue its GRC decision prior to the first day of the test year or authorize interim rates. In accordance with the rate case plan, Cal Water filed its most recent GRC application in July of 2021 requesting rate changes effective January 1, 2023.
Between GRC filings, Cal Water may file escalation rate increases, which allow Cal Water to recover cost increases, primarily from inflation and incremental investments, during the second and third years of the rate case cycle. However, escalation rate increases are district specific and subject to an earnings test. The CPUC may reduce a district’s escalation rate increase if, in the most recent 13-month period, the earnings test reflects earnings in excess of what was authorized for that district.
In addition, California water utilities are entitled to make offset requests via advice letter. Offsets may be requested to adjust revenues for construction projects authorized in GRCs when those capital projects go into service (these filings are referred to as "rate base offsets"), or for rate changes charged to Cal Water for purchased water, purchased power, and pump taxes (which are referred to as "expense offsets"). Rate changes approved in offset requests remain in effect until the next GRC is approved.
In pursuit of the State of California's water conservation goals, the CPUC decoupled Cal Water's revenue requirement from customer consumption levels in 2008 by authorizing a Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (WRAM) and Modified Cost Balancing Account (MCBA) for each district. The WRAM and MCBA ensure that Cal Water recovers revenues authorized by the CPUC regardless of customer consumption. This has removed the historical disincentive against promoting

lower water usage among customers. Through an annual advice letter filing, Cal Water recovers any under-collected metered revenue amounts authorized, or refunds over-collected metered revenues, via surcharges and surcredits. The advice letters are generally filed in April of each year and address the net WRAM and MCBA balances recorded for the previous calendar year. The majority of WRAM and MCBA balances are collected or refunded through surcharges/surcredits over 12 and 18 months. The WRAM and MCBA amounts are cumulative, so if they are not amortized in a given calendar year, the balance is carried forward and included with the following year balance. Cal Water also has a Sales Reconciliation Mechanism (SRM) in place for 2021 and 2022 (the second and third years of its 2018 GRC), that allows the company to adjust its adopted sales forecast if actual sales vary from adopted sales by more than 5.0% in the prior year in a district. The SRM moderates the growth of the net WRAM and MCBA balances until the next GRC.
The CPUC issued a decision effective August 27, 2020 requiring that Class A companies submitting GRC filings after the effective date be (i) precluded from proposing the use of a full decoupling WRAM and (ii) allowed the use of Monterey-Style Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanisms (MWRAM) and Incremental Cost Balancing Accounts (ICBA). The MWRAM tracks the difference between the revenue received for actual metered sales through the tiered volumetric rate and the revenue that would have been received with the same actual metered sales if a uniform rate had been in effect. The ICBA tracks differences in the authorized prices of water production costs and actual prices of water production costs. Cal Water has complied with this decision in its recent 2021 GRC filing.
Regulatory Activity - California
2021 GRC Filing
On July 2, 2021, Cal Water filed its 2021 GRC requesting water infrastructure investments of $1.0 billion in accordance with the rate case plan for all of its regulated operating districts for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. The CPUC will evaluate the water infrastructure improvement investments along with operating budgets to establish water rates that reflect the actual cost of service. The CPUC will also evaluate Cal Water's proposed rate design changes that would improve revenue stability and provide a discounted unit rate to the first six units of water per month for residential customers. In the proposal, this block of usage would be charged at 25% of the second tier rate. The CPUC has recognized this six-unit block as essential for basic needs. As part of the rate design changes, Cal Water has also proposed the use of a MWRAM and ICBA. The required filing was the start of an approximately 18-month review process, with any changes in customer rates expected to become effective in 2023. Cal Water has proposed to the CPUC to increase revenues by $80.5 million, or 11.1%, in 2023; $43.6 million, or 5.4%, in 2024; and $43.2 million, or 5.1%, in 2025 to support these investments. If approved as filed, we expect that the average residential customer bill would increase less than $5 per month across all of Cal Water’s service areas. Cal Water is in the process of reviewing parties’ recommendations, evaluating the validity of underlying data, and composing rebuttal testimony. Settlement negotiations with the California Public Advocates Office and intervenors will begin in the second quarter of 2022, and evidentiary hearings are scheduled for the second quarter of 2022. Any rate change because of this filing is expected to be effective on January 1, 2023.
Escalation Increase Requests
As a part of the decision on the 2018 GRC, Cal Water was authorized to request annual escalation rate increases for 2021 and 2022 for those districts that passed the earnings test. In December of 2020, Cal Water requested escalation rate increases for 2021 in 13 of its regulated districts. The increase in annual adopted gross revenue associated with the December 2020 filing was $8.2 million. The new rates were implemented on February 1, 2021.
In November of 2021, Cal Water requested escalation rate increases for 2022 in 19 of its regulated districts. The increase in annual adopted gross revenue associated with the November 2021 filing was $21.7 million. The new rates were implemented on January 1, 2022.
Expense Offset Requests
Expense offsets are dollar-for-dollar increases in revenue to match increased expenses, and therefore do not affect net operating income. In November of 2020, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to request offsets for increases in purchased water costs and pump taxes in seven of its regulated districts totaling $5.5 million. The new rates were implemented on February 1, 2021.
In September of 2021, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to request offsets for increases in purchased water costs and pump taxes in one of its regulated districts totaling $1.8 million. The new rates were implemented on October 1, 2021.
In December of 2021, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to request offsets for increases in purchased water costs and pump taxes in seven of its regulated districts totaling $5.2 million. The new rates were implemented on January 1, 2022.
Table of Contents

Rate Base Offset Requests
For construction projects authorized in GRCs as advice letter projects, Cal Water is allowed to request rate base offsets to increase revenues after the project goes into service. In July of 2020, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to recover $9.0 million of annual revenue increase for a rate base offset in one of its regulated districts. The new rates were implemented on February 1, 2021.
 In November of 2021, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to recover $0.2 million of annual revenue increase for a rate base offset in one of its regulated districts. The new rates were implemented on January 1, 2022.
WRAM/MCBA Filings
In April of 2021, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to true up the revenue under-collections for the 2020 annual WRAMs/MCBAs of its regulated districts. A net under-collection of $39.6 million is being recovered/refunded from/to customers in the form of 12, 18, and greater-than-18-month surcharges and 6 and 12-month surcredits. The new rates incorporate net WRAM/MCBA balances that were previously approved for recovery, and were implemented on April 15, 2021.
Interim Rates Memorandum Account
The 2018 GRC was approved in December of 2020. Final rates for the 2018 GRC were implemented as of February 1, 2021. As a result, Cal Water calculated and recorded a regulatory asset of $55.7 million and a corresponding increase to revenue for the difference between final rates and interim rates for the 13-month period January 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. Cal Water also recorded a regulatory liability of $1.6 million and a corresponding decrease to regulatory assets for LIRA and RSF program credits that would have been given to customers had the rate case been approved on time.
In the second quarter of 2021, Cal Water submitted advice letters to request amortization of the IRMA. The new rates were implemented on June 15, 2021. The net under collection of IRMA is being recovered/refunded in the form of 13, 18, 24, and 36-month surcharges and 13-month surcredits. 
2015 GRC PCBA and HCBA Filings
During the first six months of 2021, Cal Water submitted advice letters to amortize the PCBA and HCBA from the 2015 GRC that tracked the difference between adopted and actual costs for the period of 2017-2019. For the PCBA, $21.3 million is being recovered from customers in the form of 12 and 24-month surcharges as actual pension costs during 2017-2019 were higher than the adopted pension costs. For the HCBA, $4.3 million is being refunded to customers in the form of 12 month surcredits as actual health care costs during 2017-2019 were lower than the adopted health care costs. The new rates were implemented on June 15, 2021.
Cost of Capital Application
By order of the CPUC in its rate case plan for water utilities, Cal Water and three other large water companies (scheduled companies) were required to request a review of their cost of capital for 2021 through 2023 by May 1, 2020. On January 22, 2020, Cal Water and the scheduled companies requested the CPUC to allow a one-year extension to file their Cost of Capital applications by May 1, 2021, rather than May 1, 2020. As part of the request, the companies proposed that there be no changes to their respective costs of capital during the one-year extension. This condition mirrored the condition included in the CPUC’s previous approvals of the water companies’ requests for cost of capital extensions. The companies indicated that postponing the filing one year would alleviate administrative processing costs and provide relief for both CPUC and company resources already strained by numerous CPUC proceedings. On March 11, 2020, the CPUC granted Cal Water and the scheduled companies an extension to May 1, 2021 to file their cost of capital application. As the filing due date fell on a weekend, the filing was due on the following business day of May 3, 2021. 
On May 3, 2021, Cal Water filed its required application with the CPUC to review its cost of capital for 2022 through 2024. Cal Water requested a return on equity of 10.35%, a cost of debt of 4.23%, and a 53.4% equity capital structure. The CPUC will evaluate the proposal along with proposals of other parties, and in accordance with its standard process, is currently expected to issue a decision in the third quarter of 2022. In past rate proceedings, the Commission has made rates retroactive to the first day of the original test period, which in this case is January 1, 2022.
California Drought Memorandum Account (DRMA)
In June of 2021, Cal Water submitted advice letters to request a DRMA to track the incremental operational and administrative costs incurred to further implement updated Rule 14.1 for voluntary conservation measures and Schedule 14.1 for mandatory rationing measures, including activities related to enhanced conservation efforts, staffing, and capital expenditures to ensure a safe, reliable supply of water. The DRMA would also track monies paid by customers for fines,

penalties, or other compliance measures associated with water use violations; and penalties paid by Cal Water to its water wholesalers. The advice letters were approved by the CPUC with an effective date of June 14, 2021.
Palos Verdes Peninsula Water Reliability Project (Project)
In 2002, Cal Water commissioned a Water System Master Plan (Master Plan) for the Palos Verdes water system. The Master Plan identified the high-priority need to augment the existing potable water system with new transmission mains and a new pump station to improve the capacity and reliability of the water system. This resulted in the development of a capital project known as the Project. Before the Project, a single pipeline that is over 60 years old delivered potable water to approximately 90 percent of the Peninsula, and a second pipeline of the same age delivered water to the remaining 10 percent. Both of these pipelines were approaching the end of their useful lives. 
The CPUC authorized Cal Water to recover revenue associated with costs up to a cap of $96.1 million after the Project is in service, subject to the CPUC’s reasonableness review. In 2020, the Project was completed and an Advice Letter 2387 asking for authority to increase rates reflecting the Project costs up to the cap, with an effective date of August 27, 2020 was filed. The advice letter was approved on January 29, 2021. New rates were implemented on February 1, 2021, with the revenue requirement being effective as of August 27, 2020. 
Due to the complexity of the project, Cal Water estimates total project costs exceeded the advice letter cap of $96.1 million. Amongst other things, the 2021 GRC filing requests authority to open a memorandum account allowing Cal Water to track incremental capital-related costs associated with this project.
 Regulatory Activity - Other States
2021 Washington Water GRC (Washington Water)
On July 15, 2021, Washington Water filed a GRC application with the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) requesting a phased-in consolidation of its East Pierce Water System with its legacy Washington Water system. The requested annual revenue increase is $3.1 million and is proposed to be implemented over 3 years. After working with the WUTC and Public Counsel, the Company updated its application on February 2, 2022 with a revised annual revenue increase of $1.0 million and eliminated the 3-year rate increase proposal. The WUTC approved the GRC application on February 10, 2022 with an effective date of February 15, 2022.
Kona Water Service Company GRC (Hawaii Water)
In May of 2021, Hawaii Water submitted a private letter ruling (PLR) to the IRS requesting a ruling on the treatment of deferred taxes because of the TCJA. A favorable decision on the PLR was received on November 18, 2021. Hawaii Water is awaiting direction from the HPUC.

Kalaeloa Water Company GRC (Hawaii Water)
In August of 2021, a GRC application requesting an increase of revenues for Kalaeloa was submitted with the HPUC. If approved, the combined increase for water and sewer service revenue is $0.3 million. A commission decision is expected in the third quarter of 2022.
BVRT Utility Holding Company (BVRT) (Texas Water)
In May of 2021, Texas Water became the majority owner of BVRT, a Texas-based utility development company owning and operating four wastewater utilities serving growing communities outside of Austin and San Antonio. Texas Water initially invested funds to enable BVRT to continue to build wastewater infrastructure and converted its investment to equity. BVRT’s five wastewater utilities currently serve or are under contract to serve over 3,800 connections, with an estimated potential total build-out of more than 61,000 connections.
Water Supply
Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of their supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. To the best of management's knowledge, we are meeting water quality, environmental, and other regulatory standards for all Company-owned systems.
Historically, approximately half of our annual water supply is pumped from wells. State groundwater management agencies operate differently in each state. Some of our wells extract ground water from water basins under state ordinances. These are adjudicated groundwater basins, in which a court has settled the dispute between landowners, or other parties over how much annual groundwater can be extracted by each party. All of our adjudicated groundwater basins are located in the State of California. Our annual groundwater extraction from adjudicated groundwater basins approximates 5.4 billion gallons or 10.3% of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Historically, we have extracted less than 100% of our annual adjudicated groundwater rights and have the right to carry forward up to 20% of the unused amount to the next annual period. All of our remaining wells extract ground water from managed or unmanaged water basins. There are no set limits for the ground water extracted from these water basins. Our annual groundwater extraction from managed groundwater basins approximates 32.1 billion gallons or 61.1% of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Our annual groundwater extraction from unmanaged groundwater basins approximates 15.0 billion gallons or 28.6% of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Most of the managed groundwater basins we extract water from have groundwater recharge facilities. We are required to financially support these groundwater recharge facilities by paying well pump taxes. Our well pump taxes for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $15.3 million, $12.6 million, and $11.5 million, respectively. In 2014, the State of California enacted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014. The law and its implementing regulations require most basins to select a sustainability agency by 2017, develop a sustainability plan by the end of 2022, and show progress toward sustainability by 2027. We expect that after the act's provisions are fully implemented, substantially all the Company's California groundwater will be produced from sustainably managed and adjudicated basins.
California's normal weather pattern yields little precipitation between mid-spring and mid-fall. The Washington Water service areas receive precipitation in all seasons, with the heaviest amounts during the winter. New Mexico Water's rainfall is heaviest in the summer monsoon season. Hawaii Water receives precipitation throughout the year, with the largest amounts in the winter months. Water usage in all service areas is highest during the warm and dry summers and declines in the cool winter months. Rain and snow during the winter months in California replenish underground water aquifers and fill reservoirs, providing the water supply for subsequent delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2021, the State of California snowpack water content during the 2021-2022 water year is 51% of long-term averages (per the California Department of Water Resources, Northern Sierra Precipitation Accumulation report). The northern Sierra region is the most important for the state’s urban water supplies. The central and southern portions of the Sierras have recorded 58% and 55%, respectively, of long-term averages. Management believes that, notwithstanding higher-than-average snowpack water content, supply pumped from underground aquifers and purchased from wholesale suppliers will be adequate to meet customer demand during 2022 and thereafter. Long-term water supply plans are developed for each of our districts to help assure an adequate water supply under various operating and supply conditions. Some districts have unique challenges in meeting water quality standards, but management believes that supplies will meet current standards using currently available treatment processes.

On May 31, 2018, California's Governor signed two bills (Assembly Bill 1668 and Senate Bill 606) into law that will establish long-term standards for water use efficiency. The bills revise and expand the existing urban water management plan requirements to include five-year drought risk assessments, water shortage contingency plans, and annual water supply/demand assessments. By June 30, 2022, the California State Water Resources Control Board, in conjunction with the California Department of Water Resources, is expected to establish long-term water use standards for indoor residential use, outdoor residential use, water losses, and other uses. Cal Water will also be required to calculate and report on urban water use target by November 1, 2023 and each November 1 thereafter, that compares actual urban water use to the target. Management believes that Cal Water is well positioned to comply with all such regulations.
The following table shows the estimated quantity of water purchased and the percentage of purchased water to total water production in each California operating district that purchased water in 2021. Other than noted below, all other districts receive 100% of their water supply from wells.

The Bear Gulch district obtains a portion of its water supply from surface runoff from the local watershed. The Oroville district in the Sacramento Valley, the Bakersfield district in the San Joaquin Valley, and the Kern River Valley district in the Los Angeles Area purchase water from a surface supply. Surface sources are processed through our water treatment plants before being delivered to the distribution system. The Bakersfield district also purchases treated water as a component of its water supply.
Table of Contents

The Chico, Marysville, Dixon, and Willows districts in the Sacramento Valley, the Salinas Valley Region district in the Salinas Valley, the Selma and Visalia districts in the San Joaquin Valley, and the TAFB in Solano County obtain their entire supply from wells.
Purchases for the Los Altos, Livermore, Oroville, Redwood Valley, Stockton, and Bakersfield districts are pursuant to long-term contracts expiring on various dates after 2021. The water supplies purchased for the Dominguez, East Los Angeles, Hermosa Redondo, Palos Verdes, and Westlake districts as well as the Hawthorne and Commerce systems are provided by public agencies pursuant to a statutory obligation of continued non-preferential service to purveyors within the agencies' boundaries. Purchases for the Bayshore and Bear Gulch districts are in accordance with long-term contracts with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) until June 30, 2034.
Management anticipates water supply contracts will be renewed as they expire though the price of wholesale water purchases is anticipated to increase in the future.
Shown below are wholesaler price rates and increases that became effective in 2021, and estimated wholesaler price rates and percent changes for 2022. In 2021, several districts experienced purchased water rate increases, resulting in the filing of several purchased water offsets.

Seasonal Fluctuations
In California, our customers' consumption pattern of water varies with the weather, in terms of rainfall and temperature. In the WRAM and MCBA design, the CPUC considers the historical pattern in determining the adopted sales and production costs. With a majority of our sales being subject to the WRAM and production costs being covered by the MCBA, fluctuations in financial results have been minimized. However, cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings on our credit facilities can be significantly impacted by seasonal fluctuations including recovery of the WRAM and MCBA.
Our water business is seasonal in nature. Weather conditions can have a material effect on customer usage. Customer demand for water generally is lower during the cooler and rainy winter months. Demand increases in the spring when warmer weather returns and the rains end, and customers use more water for outdoor purposes such as landscape irrigation. Warm temperatures during the generally dry summer months result in increased demand. Water usage declines during the late fall as temperatures decrease and the rainy season begins. During years in which precipitation is especially heavy or extends beyond the spring into the early summer, customer demand can decrease from historic normal levels, generally due to reduced outdoor water usage. Likewise, an early start to the rainy season during the fall can cause a decline in customer usage. As a result, seasonality of water usage has a significant impact on our cash flows from operations and borrowing on our short-term facilities.
Utility Plant Construction
We have continually extended, enlarged, and replaced our facilities as required to meet increasing demands and to maintain the water systems. We obtain construction financing using funds from operations, long-term financing, advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction that are funded by developers. Advances for construction are cash deposits from developers for construction of water facilities or water facilities deeded from developers. These advances are generally refundable without interest over a period of 40 years in equal annual payment amounts and developer-installed facilities are exempt from corporate income taxes. Contributions in aid of construction consist of nonrefundable cash deposits or facilities transferred from developers, primarily for fire protection and relocation projects. We cannot control the amounts received from developers. This amount fluctuates from year-to-year as the level of construction activity carried on by developers varies. This activity is impacted by the demand for housing, commercial development, and general business conditions, including interest rates.
See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information.
Energy Reliability
We continue to use power efficiently to minimize the power expenses passed on to our customers, and maintain backup power systems to continue water service to our customers if the power companies' supplies are interrupted. If future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California customers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. Many of our well sites are equipped with emergency electric generators designed to produce electricity to keep the wells operating during power outages. Storage tanks also provide customers with water during blackout periods.
During 2021 and 2020, we leased additional emergency generators to respond to potential PSPSs, an electric utility operating paradigm approved by the CPUC. 
Security at Company Facilities
Due to terrorism and other risks, we have heightened security at our facilities and have taken added precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to customers. In 2002, federal legislation was enacted that resulted in new regulations concerning security of water facilities, including submitting vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government. We have complied with regulations issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to federal legislation concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the EPA as required. In addition, communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures. While we do not make public comments on our security programs, we have been in contact with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve our water delivery systems' security.
In accordance with the 2018 America’s Water Infrastructure Act (AWIA), we are required to conduct additional risk and resilience assessments and develop emergency response plans for each of our water systems. These assessments and plans include natural hazards as well as malevolent acts. The first such assessments were filed in 2020. They will be reviewed and resubmitted every five years.

While we do not make public comments on our security programs, we have been in contact with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve our water delivery systems' security
Competition and Condemnation
Our principal operations are regulated by the Commission of each state. Under state laws, no privately owned public utility may compete within any service territory that we already serve without first obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the applicable Commission. Issuance of such a certificate would only be made upon finding that our service is deficient. To management's knowledge, no application to provide service to an area served by us has been made.
State law in California provides that whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to the utility for its loss. State law in Washington and other states recognize chartered service areas but do not have specific statutes. State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies are empowered to condemn properties already operated by privately owned public utilities. The agencies are also authorized to issue bonds, including revenue bonds, for the purpose of acquiring or constructing water systems. However, if a public agency were to acquire utility property by eminent domain action, the utility would be entitled to just compensation for its loss. In Washington, annexation was approved in February 2008 for property served by us on Orcas Island; however, we continue to serve the customers in the annexed area and do not expect the annexation to affect our operations. To management's knowledge, other than the Orcas Island property, no municipality, water district, or other public agency is contemplating or has any action pending to acquire or condemn any of our systems.
Government Regulations
Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws, and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater, and airborne substances. The EPA, state water quality regulators, and other state regulatory authorities promulgate numerous nationally and locally applicable standards, including maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated to date.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by various governmental authorities. Environmental health and safety programs have been designed to provide compliance with water discharge regulations, underground and above-ground fuel storage tank regulations, hazardous materials management plans, hazardous waste regulations, air quality permitting requirements, wastewater discharge limitations, and employee safety issues related to hazardous materials. In addition, we actively investigate alternative technologies for meeting environmental regulations and continue the traditional practices of meeting environmental regulations.
For a description of the material effects that compliance with environmental regulations may have on us, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Regulatory Environment." We expect environmental regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future, and there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.
Quality of Water Supply
Our operating practices are designed to produce potable water in accordance with accepted water utility practices. Water entering the distribution systems from surface sources is treated in compliance with federal and state Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) standards. Most well supplies are chlorinated or chloraminated for disinfection. Water samples from each water system are analyzed on a regular, scheduled basis in compliance with regulatory requirements. We operate a state-certified water quality laboratory at the San Jose Customer Support Services Office that provides testing for most of our California operations. Certain tests in California are contracted with independent certified labs qualified under the Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program. Local independent state certified labs provide water sample testing for the Washington, New Mexico and Hawaii operations.
In recent years, federal and state water quality regulations have resulted in increased water sampling requirements. The SDWA continues to be used to monitor and regulate additional potential contaminants to address public health concerns. The State of California has continued to adopt new water quality regulations, which may be in addition to those adopted by the EPA. We monitor water quality standard changes and upgrade our treatment capabilities to maintain compliance with the various regulations.
Table of Contents

Impact of Climate Change Legislation and Regulation
Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California customers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings.
We maintain a fleet of vehicles to provide service to our customers, including a number of heavy-duty diesel vehicles that were retrofitted to meet California emission standards. If future legislation further affects the cost to operate the fleet or the fleet acquisition cost in order to meet certain emission standards, it will increase our cost of service and our rate base. Any increase in fleet operating costs associated with meeting emission standards will be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.
Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), all capital projects of a certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines, and treatment facilities) require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit will be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base, which will be requested to be paid for by our customers. Any increase in the operating cost of the facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.
Cap and trade regulations were implemented in 2012 with the goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. These regulations have not affected water utilities at this time. In the future, if we are required to comply with these regulations, any increase in operating costs associated with meeting these standards will be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.
Human Capital Resources
We believe our employees are our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. We offer our employees a broad range of company-paid benefits, and we believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry. Additional information about our employee benefit plans is included in Note 12.
We are committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical, and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required internal training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of discrimination.
Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of the Company’s core values. Safety efforts are led by the Corporate Safety Committee and supported by safety committees that operate at the local level. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect its workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work. 
Our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions. We believe this provides long-term focus and continuity to our operations while also providing opportunities for the growth and advancement of our employees. Our focus on retention is evident in the length of service of our management team. The average tenure of our management team is over 16 years.
Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable. At December 31, 2021, we had 1,182 employees, including 1,047 at Cal Water, 74 at Washington Water, 47 at Hawaii Water, 14 at New Mexico Water, and no employees at Texas Water. In California, the Utility Workers Union of America (UWUA), AFL-CIO represents our non-exempt field, customer service, and non-confidential clerical employees. The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), AFL-CIO represents our professional and technical engineering and water quality laboratory employees.
Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2021, we had 642 employees represented by the UWUA and 85 employees represented by the IFPTE. In 2021, we reached a six-year agreement with both unions on a new contract that runs from May 14, 2021 (UWUA) and October 4, 2021 (IFPTE) through February 28, 2027. The agreement continues to provide our employees with a market competitive pay and benefits package. 
 Employees at Hawaii Water, Washington Water, and New Mexico Water are not represented by a labor union.
