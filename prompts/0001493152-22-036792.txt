ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Regulatory Overview - Legal and Operational Risks
 
Kun Peng International Ltd. (“KPIL”) is not a Chinese operating company but rather a Nevada holding company with operations in the PRC conducted by our PRC subsidiary (King Eagle (China) Co., Ltd.) through contractual agreements with a variable interest entity (“VIE”) (King Eagle (Tianjin) Technology Co., Ltd.), as discussed in greater detail below, which structure involves unique risks to shareholders and investors including but not limited to the following:

● | PRC laws and regulations prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that operate Internet information and content, value added telecommunications, and certain other businesses in which we are engaged or could be deemed to be engaged. Consequently, our operations and business in the PRC are conducted through contractual arrangements (“VIE Agreements”) with King Eagle VIE which give us effective control over and enable us to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits arising from these business operations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Although we have been advised by our PRC counsel that the ownership structures of our PRC subsidiary and the King Eagle VIE in China do not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect and that the VIE Agreements are valid, binding, and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect, but have not been tested in court, KPIL faces uncertainty with respect to future actions by the PRC government that could significantly affect the enforceability of the VIE Agreements, King Eagle VIE’s financial performance, and the value of a shareholder’s KPIL shares. 
● | Although the PRC’s Ministry of Commerce and its National Development and Reform Commission have announced new edicts regarding the use of VIEs for new overseas offerings, they have indicated that such new requirements will not affect the foreign ownership of companies already listed overseas. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that such new rules and regulations will not be applied retroactively which may have a substantial impact on KPIL’s business and consequently on the value of KPIL’s securities. 


● | Shareholders do not have a direct equity ownership interest in King Eagle VIE but control and receive the economic benefits of its business operations in China through the VIE Agreements. Therefore, should the Chinese government disallow or limit the use of the VIE, it could result in your shares significantly declining in value or becoming worthless. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Because all of our operations are conducted in the PRC through our wholly owned subsidiary the Chinese government may exercise significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of your shares. 
● | Regulatory authorities in China have implemented and are considering further legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection and more stringent laws and regulations may be introduced in China. The PRC Cybersecurity Law provides that personal information and important data collected and generated by operators of critical information infrastructure in the course of their operations in the PRC should be stored in the PRC, and the law imposes heightened regulation and additional security obligations on operators of critical information infrastructure. We do not believe that our company constitutes a critical information infrastructure operator pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures that became effective in April 2020. However, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in China are often uncertain, in flux, and complicated, including differentiated requirements for different groups of people or different types of data, and there can be no assurance that in the future our operations may not be subject to these regulations which could have a significant material impact on our financial performance and the value of our securities. 
● | KPIL’s PRC subsidiary’s ability to distribute dividends is based upon its distributable earnings. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends to its shareholders only out of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our PRC subsidiary is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. This reserve is not distributable as cash dividends. 
● | To address persistent capital outflows and the RMB’s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016, the People’s Bank of China, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, implemented a series of capital control measures in the subsequent months, including stricter vetting procedures for China-based companies to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions, dividend payments, and shareholder loan repayments. The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC subsidiary’s dividends and other distributions may be subject to tightened scrutiny in the future. The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. 
● | In addition, the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at a rate of 10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless reduced under treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and the governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC resident enterprises are tax resident. Pursuant to the tax agreement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the withholding tax rate in respect to the payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise may be reduced to 5% from a standard rate of 10%. However, if the relevant tax authorities determine that our transactions or arrangements are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities may adjust the favorable withholding tax in the future. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the reduced 5% withholding rate will apply to dividends received by our Hong Kong subsidiary from our PRC subsidiary. This withholding tax will reduce the amount of dividends we may receive from our PRC subsidiary.

Corporate History and Structure
 
Kun Peng International Ltd. (formerly known as CX Network Group, Inc.)
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Florida on September 3, 2010, under the name of “mLight Tech, Inc.” (“MLGT”). On July 11, 2017, MLGT merged with and into CX Network Group, Inc. (“CXKJ”), a company incorporated in Nevada on July 25, 2005, with CXKJ as the surviving corporation pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated July 3, 2017.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the Company’s corporate existence is governed by the laws of the State of Nevada and the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws of the Company (the “Domicile Change”), its name was changed to CX Network Group, Inc. (the “Name Change”), and each outstanding share of MLGT’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, was converted into 0.0667 outstanding share of common stock of CXKJ, par value $0.0001 per share, at a one-for-fifteen reverse split ratio (the “Reverse Stock Split”) which resulted in reclassification of capital from par value to capital in excess of par value. Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, we had 217,300,000 shares of common stock of MLGT issued and outstanding. Immediately upon the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, we had 14,486,670 shares of common stock of CXKJ issued and outstanding.
 
The Name Change, the Domicile Change, and the Reverse Stock Split were effective as of July 12, 2017. Subsequently, the Company’s trading symbol for its common stock was changed to “CXKJ.”
 
On March 20, 2018, CXKJ, Chuangxiang Holdings Inc., a company incorporated on February 4, 2016 under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“CX Cayman”), Continent Investment Management Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“Continent”), and Golden Fish Capital Investment Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“Golden Fish,” and, together with “Continent,” the “CX Cayman Stockholders”) entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), pursuant to which CXKJ acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of CX Cayman in exchange for 5,350,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of CXKJ (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, CX Cayman became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary.
 
Immediately prior to the Share Exchange, we were a shell company with no significant assets or operations.

CX Network’s business focused on the development and operation of online dating and mobile gaming products either developed and operated by it, developed by it but co-operated by third parties, or developed by third parties but co-operated by it.

On March 30, 2021, certain of our shareholders (the “Sellers”) and a certain investor (the “Purchaser”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”), pursuant to which the Purchaser acquired 16,683,334 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $255,000, subject to satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions set forth in the SPA.
 
In connection with the SPA, on the same day, we entered into a spin-off agreement (the “Spin-Off Agreement”) with CX Cayman (the “Spin-Off Subsidiary”), and Continent Investment Management Limited and Golden Fish Capital Investment Limited, (together, the “Spin-Off Subsidiary Buyers”). Pursuant to the Spin-Off Agreement, the Spin-Off Subsidiary Buyers received all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Spin-Off Subsidiary at a purchase price of $1.

For accounting purposes, the transaction with KP International Holding was treated as a reverse acquisition, with KP International Holding as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of KP International Holding and its subsidiaries and consolidated entities. As a result of the reverse acquisition, the Company is engaged in the sale of health care products and services through its online platform in the PRC.
 
Effective October 12, 2022, we increased our authorized common stock from 200,000,000 shares, par value $0.0001, to 1,000,000,000 shares, par value $0.0001, and on October 18, 2022, we effected a 10:1 forward stock split after which we have 400,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

King Eagle (China) Co., Ltd.
 
King Eagle (China) Co., Ltd. (“King Eagle (China)”) was incorporated as a limited liability company in the People’s Republic of China on March 20, 2019, with a registered capital of approximately $15 million (RMB100 million). King Eagle (China) was a wholly owned subsidiary of KP Industrial at the time of establishment. KP Industrial transferred a 15% interest, approximately $2.2 million (RMB 15 million), to Guoxin Ruilian Group Co., Ltd., a limited liability company incorporated in Beijing, PRC, on November 2, 2020.
 
On March 26, 2021, Guoxin Ruilian Group Co., Ltd. entered into equity transfer agreements with KP Industrial and Guoxin Zhengye. Both Guoxin Ruilian Group Co., Ltd. and Guoxin Zhengye are wholly owned by a common shareholder, Guoxin United Holdings Group Co., Ltd.

Guoxin Zhengye agreed to transfer its 8% ownership interest in King Eagle (China) to KP Industrial on August 26, 2022.

King Eagle (Tianjin) Technology Co., Ltd.
 
King Eagle (Tianjin) Technology Co., Ltd. (“King Eagle VIE”) was incorporated as a limited liability company in Tianjin Pilot Free Trade Zone in the People’s Republic of China on September 2, 2020, with a registered capital of approximately $1.5 million (RMB 10 million). We do not own any of the equity of King Eagle VIE. It is owned by multiple individuals: Chengyuan Li (approximately 45.5%), Xiujin Wang (approximately 10.5%), Yuanyuan Zhang (approximately 10%), Jinjing Zhang, Wanfeng Hu, Cuilian Liu, and Zhizhong Wang (each of whom owns approximately 6%), Zhandong Fan and Hui Teng (each of whom owns approximately 5%).

Additionally, Chengyuan Li is a director and Yuanyuan Zhang is Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
 
Some of the business engaged in by King Eagle VIE is restricted or prohibited for foreign investment under PRC regulations. Therefore, King Eagle (China) entered into the VIE Agreements with King Eagle VIE and its shareholders. We do not own any equity interests in King Eagle VIE, but control and receive the economic benefits of its business operations through the VIE Agreements. The VIE Agreements enable us to provide King Eagle VIE with consulting services on an exclusive basis, in exchange for all of its annual profits, if any. In addition, we are able to appoint its senior executives and approve all matters requiring approval of its shareholders. The VIE Agreements are comprised of a Consulting Service Agreement, Business Operation Agreement, Proxy Agreement, Equity Disposal Agreement, and Equity Pledge Agreement, which are described in further detail under “Contractual Arrangements” below.
 
Under current Chinese laws and regulations, we believe that the VIE Agreements are not subject to any government approval. The shareholders of King Eagle VIE were required to register with SAFE when they established offshore vehicles to hold KP International Holding, and such SAFE registration was effected on May 14, 2021. These shareholders of King Eagle VIE have registered their equity pledge arrangement as required under the Equity Pledge Agreement with King Eagle (China). The Company faces uncertainty with respect to future actions by the PRC government that could significantly affect King Eagle VIE’s financial performance and the enforceability of the VIE Agreements. See “Contractual Arrangements,” below.

Contractual Arrangements
 
While we do not have any equity interest in our consolidated affiliated entities, King Eagle VIE and King Eagle (Beijing), we have been and are expected to continue to be dependent on them to operate our business as long as there is limitation or prohibition in the interpretation and application by local governments of regulations concerning foreign investments in companies such as our consolidated affiliated entities. We rely on our consolidated affiliated entities to maintain or renew their respective qualifications, licenses, or permits necessary for our business in China. We believe that under the VIE Agreements, we have substantial control over our consolidated affiliated entities and their respective shareholders to renew, revise, or enter into new contractual arrangements prior to the expiration of the current arrangements on terms that would enable us to continue to operate our business in China after the expiration of the current arrangements, or pursuant to certain amendments and changes of the current applicable PRC laws, regulations, and rules, on terms that would enable us to continue to operate our business in China legally. While we currently do not anticipate any changes to PRC laws in the near future that may impact our ability to carry out our business in China, no assurances can be made in this regard. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Changes in China’s economic, political, or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.” For a detailed description of the risks associated with our corporate structure and the contractual arrangements that support our corporate structure, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Commercial Relationship with VIE(s)”.

Our Business
 
As reported by Gentleman Marketing Agency (“GMA”), a study from Statista states that, between 2020 and 2025, China’s health (functional) foods market is projected to expand by 30%, reaching an estimated RMB244 billion (US$34.3 billion) by 2025. This steady and impressive expansion can only be expected to continue as the demand for health food and dietary supplements is increasing.
 
The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (“HKTDC”) published an article on China’s Health Food Market in September 2022, which stated that changes in age demographics, domestic child policy and lifestyle has driven the growth of the health food market in the People’s Republic of China.
 
HKTDC determined that the average age of the population of China is increasing. It cited statistics from the PRC government that the number of people aged 65 or above in mainland China reached 200 million in 2021, or 14.2% of its total population. This age group is expected to increase to 25% of China’s total population by 2030. Currently, the average life expectancy in China is 77.3 years and it is expected to reach 81.9 years by 2040. HKTDC quoted a study from iiMedia Research which found that the main reason seniors purchase health food is to follow their doctor’s advice or to get sufficient essential nutrients to improve their overall health. The study shows that a majority of seniors concentrated on boosting their immunity through health food. Moreover, HKTDC quoted another source that found that nearly 50% of the middle-aged and senior populations in China are willing to spend 40% of their budgets on personal health.
 
The Center for Strategic and International Studies has pointed out that mainland China replaced its legacy one-child policy with a two-child policy in 2016 and then passed a three-child policy into law in July 2021. HKTDC speculates that the universal implementation of the three-child policy can be expected to increase demand in the maternal and baby health food markets. According to HKTDC, statistics show that 94.7% of pregnant women consume health food products, particularly folic acid, milk power and multi-vitamin tablets, during pregnancy. Further, HKTDC cited a study from iiMedia Research that the maternal and baby health food markets increased by 8.2% between 2020 and 2021 to over RMB70.41 billion (US$9.89 billion) in 2021 and represented 26% of the total market share of health food in mainland China.
 
According to the above-mentioned article published by Hong Kong Trade Development Council in September 2022, the government of the People’s Republic of China has progressively encouraged its civilians to lead healthy lifestyles and minimize diseases so as to lengthen life expectancy for its people and it introduced the “Healthy China Initiative 2019-2030” in 2019. Intelligence Research Group indicated that sales of health food in mainland China rose by 8.2% in 2021, and that the health food market in mainland China represented 17.8% of global sales in that year and was the second largest health food market in the world. The market of health food in this territory is expected to grow by 6% annually from 2021 through 2025 and is projected to reach RMB328.3 billion (approximately US$46.1 billion) by 2023.

Since the global health issue and the COVID-19 pandemic, people have increased their health and nutrition consciousness. King Eagle (China) believes preventive care is the most effective investment in health. Based on the statistics compiled by Euromonitor, the market size of health care products in China was as follows:
 


Monteloeder S.L. analyzed that the demand for healthy food in the PRC has increased since the outbreak of COVID-19. It cited data announced by Suning that shows that 2020 Lunar New Year sales volume of health foods increased by 128% compared to 2019.
 
E-commerce has developed rapidly in the PRC. Management of the Company believes that we are in a new era of e-commerce and that additional characteristics of sharing economy, offline support and social interaction are evolving. We believe the rise of social e-commerce will positively impact the development of our health care business. GMA has stated “Chinese customers are highly active on social media platforms such as Weibo, Douyin, and WeChat. Creating accounts for [your] own brand and teaming up with influencers can be incredibly helpful in terms of increasing brand awareness among the target audience of health food. Additionally, it also allows companies to interact with their potential customers, build relationships and promote their products. Chinese consumers value personal relationships and often prioritize buying from people or companies that they know and bond with.”
 
To promote awareness of preventive care among the vast population of the PRC, we serve our customers through our mobile (King Eagle Mall) platform and our new online platform.
 
King Eagle Mall
 
We developed and launched a mobile social e-commerce platform, King Eagle Mall, which promotes preventive health care products and services as our core business. It adopts the S2B2C business model and integrates many major health care products and services.

The three cores and six features that we are developing through the King Eagle Mall are:
 
Core 1: Integration of resources in the health care industry
 

Feature 1 | Closed-loop supply chain | Compared with the traditional B2B and B2C marketing models, our mobile application, King Eagle Mall, has a more efficient marketing layout that does not require stocking of inventory and capital investment. All the goods being offered are supported by upstream suppliers. Customers can buy goods more flexibly, and the distribution of goods is accomplished by way of direct supply by manufacturers, which meets the needs of customers and promotes an increase in product sales. This completely closed-loop supply chain is more conducive to the rapid development of King Eagle (China) and enhanced resource utilization. 
--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature 2 | S2B2C model perfectly provides three-terminal users with the most intuitive service and use value. | S2B2C is an innovative e-commerce model that can drive much greater value innovation than traditional models. This kind of innovation is reflected in S (supplier) and B (platform) working together to provide C (customer) with more thorough services. In other words, S empowers B and supports B to conduct product and service transactions with C, while B and C pass on their needs to S, so that S can better serve B and C, satisfying a wider group and achieving a larger demand channel. 

 
Core 2: Personal health management
 

Feature 3 | Combined with Smart Kiosk to enhance personal care service dimensions | Through our physical platform, Smart Kiosk, we create profiles for each customer to record personal health data and rely on big data analysis to promote all aspects of health-related clothing, food, housing, transportation, and other daily living styles. For example, based on the member’s personal health background and medical history, the kiosk analyzes the health condition of the customer and suggests types of health supplements, food, health-related products, health checking tools, etc. that are suitable for the individual customer. 
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature 4 | Connecting to health and wellness experience, improving service height. | Ecological + elderly care + healthy lifestyle experience is an indispensable part of the health industry, and it is also a supply and demand gap that will inevitably appear in industrial development and economic development. For middle and high net worth groups, we provide different types of health and elderly lifestyle experience environments. The Smart Kiosk APP provides full-cycle and full-view high-end services, so that there is a connection between health and living. 

Core 3: Wealth value
 

Feature 5 | Sharing Wealth | Health itself is wealth. King Eagle Mall is not just a comprehensive consumer docking platform, it is also a new channel to provide wealth for upstream supply chain enterprises and terminal members. Through the integrated platform, King Eagle (China) shares healthy lifestyle information with its members and meets different health needs of different members. 
--------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature 6 | Quality of Life | To strengthen the concept of healthiness, King Eagle Mall will go deep into every corner of life in the future, providing members with more healthy choices in five areas: clothing, food, home living, daily necessities, and transportation, and guiding our members to lead a healthier and better quality life. 

 
The products focus on health-related products and services. King Eagle Mall is designed to enable health-related products to be sold by us and by third parties. King Eagle Mall’s products are divided into two sectors: self-operated products and strictly selected products which promote preventive health care. Our team screens and examines products that are and will be offered both by us and by affiliated merchants. Our major products include health care products such as dietary supplements, nutritional health foods, beauty cosmeceuticals, health foods for supporting the cardiovascular system and bone joint health, and other categories (for instance, powdered milk, dried fruits). We offer collagen peptides, probiotics, and health foods for improving blood circulation and vein health, as well as household products which can promote and improve a healthier lifestyle of our members. We receive customer orders and may arrange fulfillment with our merchants who are responsible for delivery arrangement or fulfill customer orders through our outsourced networks.

In addition, we operate customer service centers through which our members can communicate directly for any assistance related to product purchases, suggestions for health care products and services, and delivery logistics.
 
New Online Platform 
 
In October 2022, King Eagle (Tianjin) introduced and implemented a new online platform which focuses on promoting and selling our own brand of preventive health care and health related household products to wholesalers and retailers. In the platform’s initial phase, we also sell other well-known and high-quality health food products to enhance our reputation and market share. This online platform is operated at: http://api.kp-tj.com/roomapp/#/home.
 
As of December 22, 2022, we had approximately 270 wholesale members. Currently, we focus on promoting and selling our own brand of thermal therapy cabin to wholesalers. Equipped with infrared light and at a high temperature approximately like that of a hot spring, this product helps enhance blood circulation and oxygen inhalation and improves insomnia. In addition to the thermal therapy cabin, we promote and sell other popular brands and our own brand of health food products on this new platform.
 


Smart Kiosks
 
We introduced the “Smart Kiosk” concept with the support of Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd and its subsidiaries or affiliates. The construction of Smart Kiosks will be initiated and originally administered by Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd and its subsidiaries or affiliates. After the construction of each Smart Kiosk (i.e., “physical store”) is completed, Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd will cooperate with King Eagle VIE in the operation of the Smart Kiosk and in the planning for additional Smart Kiosks. The Smart Kiosk is a physical store which focuses on developing “small shop economy.” It is integrated with the King Eagle Mall which creates a “social, health, and physical store” to provide people with a professional and comprehensive source for preventive health care products and services. The Smart Kiosk is a principal component of our business.
 
The smart service kiosk functions as a physical store, customer service center, and community marketing tool for attracting customers, providing customer services, promoting our 500+ preventive health care and health related household products, and introducing concepts of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. 5G internet connection is also available for our customers to connect to our online application, King Eagle Mall, so that our customers can access King Eagle Mall and place orders for our products. 
 
On March 31, 2021, King Eagle VIE entered into an agreement with Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd. under which King Eagle VIE was granted the right to operate 50 Smart Kiosks for five years. As a result of the construction delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the agreement is being amended to delay the commencement of the five-year term until completion of construction of the Smart Kiosks. King Eagle VIE is also entitled to profit sharing from the operation of the Smart Kiosks. For the status of the construction project of Smart Kiosks, please see “COVID-19” on page 15, below
 
The operation of the Smart Kiosks can be administered in one of three models:
 

● | Operation by King Eagle VIE: The operation of the Smart Kiosk will be solely administered by King Eagle VIE. Advertising, product promotion, human resources, product display, and sales strategies will be planned, established, and operated by King Eagle VIE. Profit sharing from the operation of the Smart Kiosk will be allocated between King Eagle VIE and the party who will purchase the right-of-use of the Smart Kiosk based on mutually agreed terms. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cooperative operation of health care and health related product suppliers: King Eagle VIE will grant the right of use of Smart Kiosks to its product suppliers who sell their health care and health related household products on King Eagle Mall. The profit sharing will be allocated between King Eagle VIE and those product suppliers based on mutually agreed terms. 
● | Franchise operation: Members of King Eagle Mall will be granted the right-of-use of Smart Kiosks to run the business with the training, advertising, sales, and marketing strategies provided by King Eagle VIE. Profit sharing will be allocated between King Eagle VIE and the members based on mutually agreed terms.

Smart Kiosk
 
Since 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the central and local governments of the PRC have imposed quarantines and closures in certain affected areas. The approval process of our applications for construction permits for Smart Kiosks was delayed by the local governmental agencies. Although mainland China relaxed its COVID-19 policies and controls in early December 2022, the number of cases of COVID-19 is expected to rise. We expect that the approval process at the local government agencies will be initiated in early 2023.
 
COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, limitations on social or public gatherings and the temporary closure of business venues and facilities around the world. Due to restrictions, quarantines and closures in certain affected areas and government agencies in the PRC, the approval process of our applications for construction permits for Smart Kiosks was delayed by the local governmental agencies and construction projects of Smart Kiosks were therefore postponed.
 
Businesses and markets in mainland China have reopened and mainland China relaxed its policies and controls relating to COVID-19 in early December 2022. The number of cases of COVID-19 is expected to increase greatly. Construction of our Smart Kiosks may not be immediate, which impacts our plan of enhancing our face-to-face customer services and increasing our market share. The Company continues to focus its business on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and to promote its own brand of consumer health care and health related household products on its new online platform, which was introduced and implemented in October 2022, to mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19. The Company also follows up closely with the local governmental agencies regarding its applications for construction permits for Smart Kiosks. However, as the pandemic increased overall public health consciousness in the PRC, the Company’s average monthly online sale revenue increased by $0.2 million, or 34.4%, from $0.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 to $0.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022.
 
Therefore, we do not expect that the virus will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results at this time. However, it is not possible to predict the unanticipated consequence of the pandemic on our future business performance and liquidity due to the severity of the global situation with COVID-19. The Company continues to monitor and assess the evolving situation closely and evaluate its potential exposure.
 
Strategic Relationships to Provide Comprehensive Health Services
 
Preventive health care focuses upon the relationship between genetics, environment, physiology, psychology, and lifestyle to assist in addressing health and disease. Physical examinations assist in providing personalized solutions to eliminate the cause of disease and to treat and regulate functional changes, so as to help patients overcome disease and lead healthier lives.
 
King Eagle (China) is exploring potential strategic relations with health service providers in order to offer its members and customers integrated health conditioning, tracking management, high-level, personalized, and convenient health care, testing, consulting, and other services, based on user testing data in the King Eagle Mall and integrated with global physician resources.
 
King Eagle (China) intends to develop strategic relationships through which it can create a “social e-commerce + health + physical store” integration platform, using Smart Kiosks (i.e., “the physical stores”) as the conduit to provide people with more professional and comprehensive health services. Functional medicine starts from the relationship between genetics, environment, physiology, psychology, and lifestyle, studying the decline of human function resulting from pathological changes, and finally finding the root cause of the disease. Functional medicine offers comprehensive physical examinations and provides personalized solutions to our members to minimize their health risks and treat and regulate body functions.

Sales and Marketing
 
We will and do engage in a variety of marketing activities intended to drive user traffic to our mobile application and our new physical stores and to give us the opportunity to introduce our products and services to prospective members. For our online mobile application, King Eagle Mall, we (i) pay various mobile app channels to broadcast our apps to raise awareness of our products and increase their ranking to attract new users; (ii) engage in self-promoting on social media; (iii) advertise our products via our cooperative public platforms; (iv) organize off-line experience events and activities; (v) enter into business alliances with various well-known regional and global health care product business partners and prestigious health organizations; (vi) intend to provide health education on our official website: kp-china.com; and (vii) engage agents to promote our products. With respect to our King Eagle Mall mobile application which we launched in September 2020, our marketing strategy focuses upon seeking well known network and platform providers to broadcast our products and services, improving the products and services to raise our ranking in app stores, and display advertising to increase our exposure so as to attract new users.
Our Customers
 
Our customers primarily consist of individual members. As of December 22, 2022 and September 30, 2022, King Eagle Mall had approximately 15,172 and 15,077 members, respectively. Our new online platform focuses on wholesalers. As of December 22, 2022, our new online platform had approximately 270 wholesale members.
Customer Service
 
Our call center and email support teams monitor our mobile applications as well as mobile applications developed by other companies for fraudulent activity, assist members with billing questions, help members complete personal profiles, and answer technical questions. Customer service representatives receive ongoing training in an effort to better personalize the experience for members and paying subscribers who call or email us and to capitalize on upselling opportunities.
Technology
 
Our internal product teams are focused on the development and maintenance of our online platforms in addition to building and managing our software and hardware infrastructure. We intend to continue investing in the development of new products, such as mobile applications, and enhancing the efficiency and functionality of our existing products and infrastructure.
 
Our network infrastructure and operations are designed to deliver high levels of availability, performance, security, and scalability in a cost-effective manner. We operate web and database servers co-located at a third-party data center facility in Beijing, PRC.
 
Our Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment with minimal barriers to entry. We believe the primary competitive factors in creating a community on the Internet are functionality, brand recognition, reputation, critical mass of members, member affinity and loyalty, ease-of-use, quality of service, and reliability. We compete with a number of large and small companies, including vertically integrated Internet portals and specialty-focused media companies that provide online and offline products and services to the online market we serve.
 
According to HKTDC, a 2022 mainland health food sector report indicates that the market shares of e-commerce, direct selling, and pharmacies are 40%, 30%, and 20%, respectively. Accordingly, E-commerce has become a major sales channel in the health food industry in mainland China.
 
King Eagle (China)’s competitors mainly come from social e-commerce platforms, including Pinduoduo (based on the group buying model), Weimeng (providing services for micro-businesses), Taobao, JD, and others.

We believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including the following:
 

● | the size and diversity of our member and paying subscriber bases; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the timing and market acceptance of our apps, including developments and enhancements to those apps, and features relative to those offered by our competitors; 
● | customer service and support efforts; 
● | selling and marketing efforts; and 
● | our brand strength in the marketplace relative to our competitors.

We purchase the consumer preventive health food and health related household products sold on our platforms from our suppliers; we did not develop, design, or manufacture those products. Moreover, although we have built our online platform and mobile commerce in-house, the compensation costs for our in-house technology team were not significant. Accordingly, instead of presenting the compensation costs of our in-house technology team as research and development expenses, we included these amounts in employee compensation and benefit expenses within general and administrative expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

Regulations
 
Because all of our operating entities are located in the PRC, we are regulated by the national and local laws of the PRC. This section summarizes the major PRC regulations relating to our business. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Doing Business in China.”
Regulations Regarding Foreign Investment
 
The Catalogue of Industries for Encouraged Foreign Investment (2020 Edition) (the “Encouraging Catalogue”) was jointly promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission (the “NDRC”) and the Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”) on December 27, 2020, and it came into effect on January 27, 2021. The Special Administrative Measures for Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List) (2020 Edition) (the”2020 Negative List”) was jointly promulgated on June 23, 2020 and took effect on July 23, 2020. The Encouraging Catalogue and the 2020 Negative List categorize industries into three categories - “encouraged,” “restricted,” and “prohibited.” All industries that are not listed under one of “encouraged,” “restricted,” or “prohibited” categories are deemed to be “permitted.” The Encouraging Catalogue and the 2020 Negative List are subject to review and update by the Chinese government from time to time. Our business is classified under the category of “encouraged.”
Regulation Regarding Foreign Exchange Registration of Offshore Investment by PRC
 
The Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37, issued by SAFE and effective on July 4, 2014 regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, by PRC residents or entities to seek offshore investment and financing and conduct round trip investment in China.
 
Circular 37 and other SAFE rules require PRC residents, including both legal and natural persons, to register with local banks before making a capital contribution to any company outside of China (an “offshore SPV”) with onshore or offshore assets and equity interests legally owned by PRC residents. In addition, any PRC individual resident who is a stockholder of an offshore SPV is required to update his or her registration with the local banks with respect to that offshore SPV in connection with a change of basic information of the offshore SPV such as its company name, business term, the shareholding by the individual PRC resident, merger, division, and with respect to the individual PRC resident in case of any increase or decrease of capital in the offshore SPV, transfer of shares, or swap of shares by the individual PRC resident. Failure to comply with the required SAFE registration and updating requirements described above may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the PRC subsidiaries of such offshore SPV, including increasing the registered capital or payment of dividends and other distributions to, and receiving capital injections from, the offshore SPV. Failure to comply with Circular 37 may also subject the relevant PRC residents or the PRC subsidiaries of such offshore SPV to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.
 
Regulations Regarding Foreign Exchange
 
Under the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and revised in 1997 and 2008 and various regulations issued by SAFE and other relevant PRC government authorities, RMB is convertible into other currencies without prior approval from SAFE only to the extent of current account items, such as trade related receipts and payments, interest, and dividends, and after complying with certain procedural requirements. The conversion of RMB into other currencies and remittance of the converted foreign currency outside the PRC for the purpose of capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans, and repatriation of investment, requires prior approval from SAFE or its local office. Payments for transactions that take place within China must be made in RMB. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies must repatriate foreign currency payments received from abroad. Foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks subject to a cap set by SAFE or its local office. Unless otherwise approved, domestic enterprises must convert all of their foreign currency proceeds into RMB.
 
On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated Circular 142 which regulates the conversion by a foreign-funded enterprise of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Circular 45 on November 9, 2011 in order to clarify the application of Circular 142. Under Circular 142 and Circular 45, the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of Circular 142 and Circular 45 could result in severe penalties, such as heavy fines as set out in the relevant foreign exchange control regulations. On July 4, 2014, SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 36, which launched a pilot reform of the administration of the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of foreign-invested enterprises in certain designated areas from August 4, 2014. However, SAFE Circular 36 continues to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from directly or indirectly using the Renminbi converted from their foreign exchange capital for purposes beyond their business scope. On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated Circular 19 to expand the reform nationwide. Circular 19 came into force and replaced both Circular 142 and Circular 36 on June 1, 2015. Circular 36 allowed enterprises established within the pilot areas to use their foreign exchange capital to make equity investments and removed certain other restrictions provided under Circular 142 for these enterprises. Circular 19 removed those restrictions for all foreign-invested enterprises established in the PRC. However, both Circular 36 and Circular 19 continue to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using the Renminbi funds converted from their foreign exchange capital for expenditures beyond their business scope, providing entrusted loans, or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises.
 

19
--


On June 9, 2016, SAFE promulgated Circular 16, which provides an integrated standard for converting foreign exchange under capital account items (including but not limited to foreign exchange capital and foreign debts) on a discretionary basis which applies to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital of a company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope or prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, and such converted Renminbi shall not be provided as loans to its non-affiliated entities, except where it is expressly permitted in the company’s business license.
 
Regulations regarding privacy and data protection
 
Regulatory authorities in China have implemented and are considering further legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. New laws and regulations that govern new areas of data protection or impose more stringent requirements may be introduced in China. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in China are often uncertain, in flux and complicated, including differentiated requirements for different groups of people or different types of data.
 
The PRC regulatory and enforcement regime with regard to privacy and data security is evolving. The PRC Cybersecurity Law provides that personal information and important data collected and generated by operators of critical information infrastructure in the course of their operations in the PRC should be stored in the PRC, and the law imposes heightened regulation and additional security obligations on operators of critical information infrastructure. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures promulgated by the Cyberspace Administration of China and certain other PRC regulatory authorities in April 2020, which became effective in June 2020, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. We do not believe that our company constitutes a critical information infrastructure operator pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures that became effective in April 2020. The PRC government is increasingly focused on data security, recently launching cybersecurity review against a number of mobile apps operated by several US-listed Chinese companies and prohibiting these apps from registering new users during the review period.
 
On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments) for public comments, which proposes to authorize the relevant government authorities to conduct cybersecurity review on a range of activities that affect or may affect national security, including listings in foreign countries by companies that possess the personal data of more than one million users. The PRC National Security Law defines various types of national security, including technology security and information security.
 
On November 14, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China released the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments) and will accept public comments until December 13, 2021. The draft Regulations on Network Data Security provide that data processors refer to individuals or organizations that autonomously determine the purpose and the manner of processing data. If a data processor that processes personal data of more than one million users intends to list overseas, it shall apply for a cybersecurity review. In addition, data processors that process important data or are listed overseas shall carry out an annual data security assessment on their own or by engaging a data security services institution, and the data security assessment report for the prior year should be submitted to the local cyberspace affairs administration department before January 31 of each year.

We currently have less than one million registered users on our digital and only require and obtain user information after users register with it. Given that we sell and service products through our digital platform, we may constitute a “data processor,” but the number of our online registered users is far less than one million. As a result, even if enacted, we would not be required to apply for a cybersecurity review under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments) or the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments). Nevertheless, the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments) or the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments) are still being formulated and subject to further changes Although we believe we currently are not required to obtain clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments), the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments), or the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, we face uncertainties as to the interpretation or implementation of such regulations or rules and we may in the future be required to perform a data security assessment annually either by ourselves or by retaining a third party data security service provider and submitting such data security assessment report to the local agency every year under the draft Regulations on Network Data Security
 
On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China promulgated the Data Security Law which took effect on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law provides for data security and privacy obligations of entities and individuals carrying out data activities, prohibits entities and individuals in China from providing any foreign judicial or law enforcement authority with any data stored in China without approval from competent PRC authority, and sets forth the legal liabilities of entities and individuals found to be in violation of their data protection obligations, including rectification order, warning, fines of up to RMB10 million, suspension of relevant business, and revocation of business permits or licenses.
 
On August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law which took effect on November 1, 2021. In addition to other rules and principles of personal information processing, the Personal Information Protection Law specifically provides rules for processing sensitive personal information. Sensitive personal information refers to personal information that, once leaked or illegally used, could easily lead to the infringement of human dignity or harm to the personal or property safety of an individual, including biometric recognition, religious belief, specific identity, medical and health, financial account, personal whereabouts, and other information of an individual, as well as any personal information of a minor under the age of 14. Only where there is a specific purpose and sufficient necessity, and under circumstances where strict protection measures are taken, may personal information processors process sensitive personal information. A personal information processor shall inform the individual of the necessity of processing such sensitive personal information and the impact thereof on the individual’s rights and interests. As uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and implementation of the Personal Information Protection Law, we cannot assure you that we will comply with the Personal Information Protection Law in all respects and regulatory authorities may order us to rectify or terminate our current practice of collecting and processing sensitive personal information.
 
Compliance with the PRC Cybersecurity Law, the PRC National Security Law, the Data Security Law, the Cybersecurity Review Measures, the Personal Information Protection Law, as well as additional laws and regulations that PRC regulatory bodies may enact in the future, may result in additional expenses to us and subject us to negative publicity, which could harm our reputation among users and negatively affect the trading price of our common stock in the future. PRC regulators, including the Department of Public Security, the MIIT, the SAMR and the CAC, have been increasingly focused on regulation in the areas of data security and data protection, and are enhancing the protection of privacy and data security by rulemaking and enforcement actions at central and local levels. We expect that these areas will receive greater and continued attention and scrutiny from regulators and the public going forward, which could increase our compliance costs and subject us to heightened risks and challenges associated with data security and protection. If we are unable to manage these risks, we could become subject to penalties, including fines, suspension of business, prohibition against new user registration (even for a short period of time) and revocation of required licenses, and our reputation and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with the above and other regulatory requirements or privacy protection-related laws, rules and regulations could result in reputational damages or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, consumers, or others. These proceedings or actions could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our data and other business practices, increase our costs and severely disrupt our business, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.

Taxation
 
PRC Enterprise Income Tax
 
The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, and its implementation rules provide that from January 1, 2008, a uniform income tax rate of 25% is applied equally to domestic enterprises as well as foreign investment enterprises.
 
The EIT Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends and other distributions payable by a PRC resident enterprise to investors who are “non-resident enterprises” (that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant dividend or other distribution is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business). However, pursuant to the Arrangement between the Mainland and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income effective on December 8, 2006, the withholding tax rate for dividends paid by a PRC resident enterprise is 5% if the Hong Kong enterprise is determined by the competent tax authority in the PRC to have satisfies the relevant conditions and requirements under the applicable laws ; otherwise, the dividend withholding tax rate is 10%. According to the Notice of the PRC State Administration of Taxation on Issues relating to the Administration of the Dividend Provision in Tax Treaties promulgated on February 20, 2009, and effective on the same day, the corporate recipient of dividends distributed by PRC enterprises must satisfy the direct ownership thresholds at all times during the 12 consecutive months preceding the receipt of the dividends. However, if a company is deemed to be a pass-through entity rather than a qualified owner of benefits, it cannot enjoy the favorable tax treatments provided in the tax arrangement. In addition, if transactions or arrangements are deemed by the relevant tax authorities to be entered into mainly for the purpose of enjoying favorable tax treatments under the tax arrangement, such favorable tax treatments may be subject to adjustment by the relevant tax authorities in the future.
 
Business Tax and Value-added Tax
 
Pursuant to the Temporary Regulations on Business Tax, which were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, and effective on January 1, 1994, as amended on November 10, 2008, and effective January 1, 2009, any entity or individual conducting business in a service industry is generally required to pay business tax at the rate of 5% on the revenues generated from providing such services.
 
In March 2016, the Ministry of Finance and SAT jointly issued the Pilot Program of Replacing Business Tax with Value-Added Tax (“VAT”) in an All-round Manner, or Circular 36, effective from May 2016, according to which PRC tax authorities have started imposing VAT on revenues from various service sectors, including real estate, construction, financial services and insurance, as well as other lifestyle service sectors, replacing the business tax replacing the business tax that co-existed with VAT for over 20 years. According to Provisional Regulations on VAT of the PRC and its detailed rules for the Implementation, organizations and individuals engaging in the sale of goods or processing, repair and assembly services, the sale of services, intangible assets, immovables, and importation of goods in the PRC shall be taxpayers of VAT and shall pay VAT pursuant to these regulations.
 
Business Licenses
 
Any company that conducts business in the PRC must have a business license that covers a particular type of work. Other than regular business licenses that we have already obtained, there is no special license or permit required for us to engage in the current businesses under PRC laws and regulations.
 
Any company that conducts business in the PRC must have a business license that covers the scope of the business in which such company is engaged. Following the 2021 Share Exchange, we conduct our business through our control of KP International Holding. Each of King Eagle (China), King Eagle VIE, and King Eagle (Beijing) holds a business license that covers its present or planned business.

Dividend Distributions
 
Under applicable PRC regulations, FIEs in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a FIE in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The Board of Directors of a FIE has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.
 
After-tax profits/losses with respect to the payment of dividends out of accumulated profits and the annual appropriation of after-tax profits as calculated pursuant to PRC accounting standards and regulations do not result in significant differences as compared to after-tax earnings as presented in our financial statements. However, there are certain differences between PRC accounting standards and regulations and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, arising from different treatment of items such as amortization of intangible assets and change in fair value of contingent consideration rising from business combinations.
 
In addition, under the EIT Law, the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Negotiated Reduction of Dividends and Interest Rates, which was issued on January 29, 2008, the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, which became effective on December 8, 2006, and the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties, which became effective on April 1, 2018, dividends from our PRC operating subsidiaries paid to us through our Hong Kong subsidiary may be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 10%, or at a rate of 5% if our Hong Kong subsidiary is considered a “beneficial owner” that is generally engaged in substantial business activities and entitled to treaty benefits under the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion.

Laws and Regulations Related to Employment and Labor Protection
 
On June 29, 2007, the National People’s Congress promulgated the Employment Contract Law of PRC (“Employment Contract Law”), which became effective as of January 1, 2008, and amended on December 28, 2012. The Employment Contract Law requires employers to provide written contracts to their employees, restricts the use of temporary workers and aims to give employees long-term job security.
 
Pursuant to the Employment Contract Law, employment contracts lawfully concluded prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law and continuing as of the date of its implementation shall continue to be performed. Where an employment relationship was established prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law but no written employment contract was concluded, a contract must be concluded within one month after its implementation.
 
On September 18, 2008, the State Council promulgated the Implementing Regulations for the PRC Employment Contract Law which came into effect immediately. These regulations interpret and supplement the provisions of the Employment Contract Law.
 
Our standard employment contract complies with the requirements of the Employment Contract Law and its implementing regulations. We have entered into written employment contracts with all of our employees.
 
Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law and the PRC Labor Contract Law, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees. All employers must comply with local minimum wage standards. Violations of the PRC Labor Contract Law and the PRC Labor Law may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative and criminal liability in the case of serious violations.
 
In addition, according to the PRC Social Insurance Law and Administration Measures on Housing Fund, employers like our PRC subsidiaries in China must provide employees with welfare schemes covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance, and housing funds.
