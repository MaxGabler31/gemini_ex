Item 1. Business
The Company 
Unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We organized as a business corporation under the laws of New Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through predecessor organizations, we trace our heritage in the food business back to 1869. Our principal executive offices are in Camden, New Jersey 08103-1799. 
In 2013, we acquired BF Bolthouse Holdco LLC (Bolthouse Farms) and Plum, PBC (formerly Plum Inc.) (Plum). In 2014, we acquired Kelsen Group A/S (Kelsen) and divested our European simple meals business. In 2015, we acquired the assets of Garden Fresh Gourmet. On December 12, 2017, we acquired Pacific Foods of Oregon, LLC (Pacific Foods) and, on March 26, 2018, we acquired Snyder's-Lance, Inc. (Snyder's-Lance). See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our recent acquisitions. 
On August 30, 2018, we announced our vision to be a leading snacks and simple meals company, with a portfolio of best-in-class products and brands in our core North American market. In support of this strategy, we will continue to focus on the integration of Snyder’s-Lance. We also announced plans to pursue the divestiture of businesses within two operating segments: our international biscuits and snacks operating segment, which includes Arnott’s, Kelsen and our operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan; and the Campbell Fresh operating segment, which includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business. In 2018, the international biscuits and snacks operating segment and the Campbell Fresh operating segment combined represent approximately $2.1 billion in net sales. We expect to use the proceeds from these divestitures to reduce debt. As a result of a more focused portfolio, we are pursuing increased multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $945 million by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information regarding our strategy and cost savings initiatives.
Reportable Segments 
Commencing in the third quarter of 2018, we have four operating segments and three reportable segments. The segments are aggregated based on similar economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers, distribution methods, and regulatory environment. The reportable segments are:

The segment includes the following products: Campbell’s condensed and ready-to-serve soups; Swanson broth and stocks; Prego pasta sauces; Pace Mexican sauces; Campbell’s gravies, pasta, beans and dinner sauces; Swanson canned poultry; Plum food and snacks; V8 juices and beverages; Campbell’s tomato juice; and Pacific broth, soups, non-dairy beverages and other simple meals;

See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information regarding our reportable segments.
Ingredients and Packaging 
The ingredients and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food and beverage products are purchased from various suppliers. These items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including changes in crop size, cattle cycles, crop disease, crop pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements (including tariffs), drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control during the growing and harvesting seasons. To help reduce some of this price volatility, we use a combination of purchase orders, short- and long-term contracts, inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging. Ingredient inventories are generally at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring. Since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only during certain seasons, we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients in their respective seasons. In addition, certain of the materials required for the manufacture of our products, including steel, have been or may be impacted by new or recently proposed tariffs. At this time, we do not anticipate any material restrictions on the availability of ingredients or packaging that would have a significant impact on our businesses. For information on the impact of inflation, see "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Customers 
In most of our markets, sales and merchandising activities are conducted through our own sales force and/or third-party brokers and distribution partners. In the U.S., Canada and Latin America, our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores, drug stores, dollar stores, e-commerce and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. Each of Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance also has a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors. In the Asia Pacific region and Europe, our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains, convenience stores, e-commerce and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. We make shipments promptly after acceptance of orders. 
Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated net sales in 2018, 39% in 2017 and 40% in 2016. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales in 2018, and 20% of our consolidated net sales in 2017 and 2016. All of our reportable segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales. For additional information on our customers, see "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
Trademarks and Technology 
As of September 17, 2018, we owned over 4,400 trademark registrations and applications in over 160 countries. We believe our trademarks are of material importance to our business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We believe that our principal brands, including Arnott's, Bolthouse Farms, Campbell's, Cape Cod, Chunky, Emerald, Garden Fresh Gourmet, Goldfish, KETTLE, Kettle Brand, Kjeldsens, Lance, Late July, Milano, Pace, Pacific, Pepperidge Farm, Plum, Pop Secret, Prego, Royal Dansk, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, Snyder's of Hanover, Swanson, and V8, are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used. 
Although we own a number of valuable patents, we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, we own copyrights, both registered and unregistered, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered. 
Competition 
We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories. This competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories, and includes producers of private label products, as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers. Private label products are generally sold at prices lower than prices for branded products. Competitors market and sell their products through traditional retailers and e-commerce. All of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. The number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space and customer service. 
Working Capital 
For information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital items, see "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

Capital Expenditures 
During 2018, our aggregate capital expenditures were $407 million. We expect to spend approximately $400 million for capital projects in 2019. Major capital projects based on planned spend in 2019 include a U.S. warehouse optimization project, transition of production of the Toronto manufacturing facility to our U.S. thermal plants and ongoing refrigeration system replacement projects.
Research and Development 
During the last three fiscal years, our expenditures on research and development activities relating to new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing products were $110 million in 2018, $111 million in 2017, and $105 million in 2016. The decrease from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to lower investments in long-term innovation and lower incentive compensation costs, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, inflation and other factors. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to inflation and other factors, and investments in long-term innovation, partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives and lower incentive compensation costs.
Regulation
The manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the U.S., our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor, Department of Commerce and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the U.S. In addition, the current U.S. administration has implemented and is considering tariffs on certain imported commodities, including steel tariffs. In response, other countries have adopted and/or considering countervailing tariffs on imported food and agriculture products. 
Environmental Matters 
We have requirements for the operation and design of our facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations. Of our $407 million in capital expenditures made during 2018, approximately $12 million were for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. We further estimate that approximately $28 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2019 will be for compliance with U.S. environmental laws and regulations. We believe that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (both within the U.S. and elsewhere) will not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. In addition, we continue to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the U.S. and elsewhere relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. While the impact of these laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position.
Seasonality 
Demand for soup products is seasonal, with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume. Sales of Kelsen products are also highest in the fall and winter months due primarily to holiday gift giving, including the Chinese New Year. Demand for our other products is generally evenly distributed throughout the year. 
Employees 
On July 29, 2018, we had approximately 23,000 employees.

Financial information for our reportable segments and geographic areas is found in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For risks attendant to our foreign operations, see "Risk Factors."
