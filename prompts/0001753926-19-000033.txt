Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
TheStreet, Inc. is a leading financial news and information provider to investors and institutions worldwide. The Company’s flagship brand, The Street (www.thestreet.com) has produced unbiased business news and market analysis for individual investors for more than 20 years.
 
From time to time, the Board of Directors and our senior management team review and evaluate strategic opportunities and alternatives as part of a long-term strategy to increase stockholder value. Such opportunities and alternatives include remaining as a stand-alone entity, potential acquisitions of companies, businesses or assets that align with our strategic objectives and potential dispositions of one or more of our businesses. The Board’s consideration of strategic opportunities and alternatives took on a renewed focus following the realignment of our capital structure in November 2017, with the Board determining to review, among other things, our mix of businesses with a view to possibly unlocking the value the Board believed was in our portfolio as well as possibly growing our businesses through acquisitions. This unlocking of value began through the divestiture of our RateWatch business in June 2018 for a sale price of $33.5 million and continued through the sale of our business-to-business units, The Deal and BoardEx, for $87.3 million in February 2019.
 
In connection with the sale of RateWatch, and the forth coming sale of The Deal and BoardEx, we have experienced an overall reduction in headcount and operations and our management intends to take actions to bring overhead costs in line with our continuing operations by reducing our corporate and public company costs. In connection with the sale of The Deal and BoardEx in February 2019, our chief executive officer, David Callaway, has stepped down and Eric Lundberg has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer, while also continuing as our Chief Financial Officer.
 
2018 was a significant year for us and in 2019 TheStreet will continue to execute on its business plan for the B2C business, including our focus on subscription revenue and expanding event revenue. We have reported improving metrics for the B2C subscription business over the last few quarters, including an increase in new orders, average price, bookings, conversion and renewal rates.

Business-to-Business 
 
Our business-to-business, or B2B, products provide dealmakers, their advisers, institutional investors and corporate executives with news, data and analysis of mergers and acquisitions and changes in corporate control, relationship mapping services, and competitive bank rate data. Our B2B business products, as described in greater detail below, have helped diversify our business from primarily serving retail investors to also providing an indispensable source of business intelligence for both high net worth individuals and executives in the top firms in the world.
 
Our B2B business derives revenue primarily from subscription products, events/conferences and information services. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our B2B businesses generated 48% of our total revenue. Our B2B businesses were sold to Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC in February 2019.
 
The Deal
 
In September 2012, we acquired The Deal, L.L.C., or The Deal, which began as a broadsheet newspaper for retail investors and transformed its business into a digital subscription model that delivers sophisticated coverage primarily to institutional investors on changes in corporate control, including merges and acquisitions, private equity, corporate activism and restructuring. The Deal is a trusted information source for organizations seeking to generate deal flow, improve client intelligence and enhance market knowledge. It provides full access to proprietary commentary, analysis and data produced every day by our editors and journalists and content feeds can be customized based on each client’s job function, deal focus and workflow. Content can be delivered via email, mobile, web or existing corporate platform. The Deal is headquartered in New York and has offices in London, England, San Francisco, California, Washington DC and Chennai, India.
In April 2013, we also acquired The DealFlow Report, The Life Settlements Report and the PrivateRaise database from DealFlow Media, Inc. to further broaden the information and services available to institutional investors. These newsletters and this database, and the employees providing their content, have been incorporated into The Deal.
 
BoardEx
 
In October 2014, we acquired Management Diagnostics Limited, the developer of the leading relationship capital management service BoardEx, collectively, BoardEx. BoardEx expanded our international operations and furthered our transition from primarily serving retail investors to also becoming an indispensable data and business intelligence source for institutional clients. Founded in 1999, BoardEx is an institutional relationship capital management database and platform and currently holds in-depth profiles of almost one million of the world’s most important business leaders. BoardEx’s proprietary software shows the relationships between and among these individuals and a user and his/her contacts. Clients, including investment banks, consultancies, executive search firms, law firms and universities use BoardEx to leverage their relationships and facilitate business and corporate development initiatives. BoardEx is headquartered in London, England and has locations in New York and Chennai, India.

Since its inception in 1996, we have distinguished ourselves as a trusted and reliable source for financial news and information with journalistic excellence, an unbiased approach and interactive multimedia coverage of the financial markets, economy, industry trends, investment and financial planning.
 
Our B2C business generates revenue primarily from premium subscription products, advertising and events. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our B2C business generated 52% of our total revenue.
 
Our most recognizable consumer products include the following:

On February 14, 2019, the Company sold its Business to Business segment and going forward, the Company will have only one reportable segment: Business to Consumer. Further information regarding our operating segments may be found in Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We pursue a variety of sales and marketing initiatives to increase traffic to our sites, license our content, sell advertising, increase subscriptions for our B2B and B2C products and expose our brands to new audiences. These initiatives include promotion through online, search marketing, email, social, direct mail and telemarketing channels. We employ marketers and designers who plan and create campaigns for the various business units which are then implemented by our technical and operations team as well as by third-party service providers. Our business intelligence group, responsible for reporting and analysis, helps determine the effectiveness of our campaigns and make informed decisions. In addition to these marketing efforts, we employ a sales force that sells directly to advertisers and their agencies, as well as to institutional clients as outlined above.

We use content syndication and subscription distribution to capitalize on the cost efficiencies of digital distribution and to garner additional value from content we have produced for our own properties. By syndicating our content to other leading digital properties, we expose our brands and top-quality journalism to millions of potential users/subscribers. For example, we provide digital properties in our vertical, including Yahoo! Finance, Marketwatch and MSN, with selected content to host along with additional article headlines that these partners display on their stock quote result pages, in both instances providing links back to our site. This type of content licensing exposes new audiences to our brands and generates additional traffic to our sites, creating the opportunity for us to increase our advertising revenue and subscription sales.
 
To attract additional visitors to our sites, we utilize search engine optimization tools to increase the visibility of our content on Google, Yahoo, Bing and similar search engines. We also have a social media team that works across platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter to increase awareness and drive traffic to our content, events and subscription products. 
 
With digital traffic now almost evenly split between desktop and mobile platforms and devices, we continually improve our products to be as mobile-friendly as possible, while developing and distributing mobile and tablet applications to deliver our content to mobile-first audiences. The Deal and BoardEx both have robust mobile sites and apps and are using mobile alerts to continually engage with users/subscribers. We maintain a “unified” TheStreet app which will allow users to access our free and paid content in a single environment. Finally, we continue to focus on increasing the engagement our visitors have with our online and mobile offerings, measured by visits per visitor, page views per visit and by time spent on site, and we continuously seek to improve the experience our digital products offer.
 
We consistently obtain exposure through other media outlets who cite our journalists and our content or who invite our editorial staff to appear on segments to provide key market commentary and consumer advice. In 2018, we were mentioned or featured in almost 100 reports by national publications and national and local broadcast media including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and CNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox, among others.
 
Competition
 
We compete with a broad range of content providers, newsletter publishers, event producers and information services. We face competition primarily from:
 

● | online content providers focused on business, personal finance or investing content, such as The Wall Street Journal Digital Network, CNN Business, Forbes.com, Reuters.com, Bloomberg.com, Seeking Alpha, Business Insider and CNBC.com, as well as portals such as Yahoo! Finance, AOL Daily Finance and MSN; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | publishers and distributors of traditional media with a focus on business, finance or investing, such as The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, personal finance talk radio programs and business television networks such as Bloomberg, CNBC and the Fox Business Channel as well as investment newsletter publishers, such as The Motley Fool, Stansberry & Associates Investment Research and InvestorPlace Media. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Many of these competitors have significantly greater scale and resources than we do. Additionally, advances in technology have reduced the cost of production and online distribution of written, audio and video content, which has resulted in the proliferation of small, often self-published providers of free content.
 
Advertisers and their agencies often look to independent measurement data such as that provided by comScore, Inc., a leading cross-platform measurement company that measures audiences and consumer behavior in order to gain a sense of the performance of various sites, in relation to their peer category when determining where to allocate advertising dollars. According to comScore, TheStreet.com is ranked as the top website for users having a portfolio value over $1 million and for those that check stock quotes multiple times each day, and ranks number 2 for reaching Certified Financial Planners.

Our ability to compete successfully depends on many factors, including the format, quality, originality, timeliness, insightfulness and trustworthiness of our content and that of our competitors, the reputations of our contributors and our brands, the success of our recommendations and research, our ability to introduce products and services that keep pace with new technology and distribution methods, investing trends, the experience we and our competitors offer our users and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.
 
Infrastructure, Operations and Technology
 
B2B
 
The Deal and BoardEx are based on proprietary and commercial systems developed for consumption by institutional clients. Both our BoardEx and The Deal systems consist of a mixture of proprietary and commercial software hosted within the Amazon Web Services environment. The Deal system distributes the content via an email delivery system or web based platform. The BoardEx system distributes data to multiple client platforms either hosted within Amazon Web Services or on the clients’ premises via commercial software before redistributing it via a standard email delivery system, data feed processes, or to a web interface.
 
B2C

Our main technological infrastructure consists of proprietary content management system and subscription management and e-commerce systems provided by third party vendors.  We also utilize the services of third-party cloud computing providers, more specifically Amazon Web Services, as well as content delivery networks such as Fastly, to help us efficiently distribute our content to our customers and ensure resiliency and scalability of service. Our content-management systems are based on proprietary software and Kaltura Content Management Systems. They allow our stories, videos and data to be prepared for distribution online to a large audience. These systems enable us to distribute and syndicate our content economically and efficiently to multiple destinations in a variety of technical formats.
 
In connection with the sale of our B2B business, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC that provides for TheStreet to provide certain services with respect to the B2B business requested by Euromoney following the closing of the Sale.
 
Intellectual Property
 
To protect our intellectual property, or IP, we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patent protection, confidentiality agreements and various other contractual arrangements with our employees, affiliates, customers, strategic partners, vendors and others. We have many trademark registrations and copyrights in the United States and internationally, and have pending trademark and patent applications in the United States and internationally. In addition, our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, employee handbook, and other internal policies seek to protect our IP against misappropriation, infringement, and unfair competition. We also utilize various tools to police the Internet to monitor piracy and unauthorized use of our content. Finally, whether we are contracting out our IP or licensing third-party content and/or technology, we incorporate contractual provisions to protect our IP and seek indemnification for any third-party infringement claims.
 
However, we cannot provide any guarantee that the foregoing provisions will be adequate to protect us from third-party claims or that these provisions will prevent the theft of our IP, as we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our IP rights. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, any infringement claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on our part, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Customers
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2018, two single customers accounted for more than 10% of our gross accounts receivable balance.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 556 full-time employees with approximately 63% located in Chennai, India. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
Following the closing of the sale of our B2B units on February 14, 2019, we reduced our headcount to approximately 95 full-time employees.

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to government regulation in connection with securities laws and regulations applicable to all publicly-owned companies, as well as laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally, including privacy regulations and taxes levied adopted at the local, state, national and international levels. In recent years, consumer protection regulations, particularly in connection with the Internet, has become more aggressive, and we expect that new laws and regulations will continue to be enacted at the local, state, national and international levels. Such new legislation, alone or combined with increasingly aggressive enforcement of existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance and business due to increased compliance costs.
